  "biography": "“Mississippi” John Hurt was Born July 3, 1893, Teoc (Carroll County) MS and died November 2, 1966, Grenada, MS. John’s father was Isom Hurt and his mother was Mary Jan McCain. John was one of 3 children. He and his wife, Jessie, had 14 children.\n\n Mississippi John Hurt’s quiet dignity, humor, superb guitar style, and his tender and expressive voice made him one of the most popular artist of traditional country blues re-discovered by the public in the sixties. \n\n John arranged classic American folk and blues songs to entertain his neighbors on Saturday evenings. \n\n Mississippi John never pursued success. In 1928, a mobile unit of the Vocalion company came to Avalon, Mississippi to look for new talents. An audition in Avalon resulted in John being called several months later to go to New York for a recording session under the direction of Lonnie Johnson. The depression led to the reduction in pressing of records and John stayed in Avalon and lived quietly on his farm with his 14 children.\n\n Guided by the words of one of the titles recorded in 1928 by Hurt, “Avalon My Home Town”, the folklorist Tom Hoskins decided in 1963 to go to Avalon. He met Hurt, who was shocked to see that someone remembered his 1928 recordings that had brought him only twenty dollars a song.\n\n John Hurt’s new career lasted only three years, but at Newport Festival, on college campuses, and in the folk clubs of Washington D.C., he displayed his talents as storyteller, entertainer, and singer. He overwhelmed the public with his outstanding mastery of the guitar.",

Singing to a melodious finger-picked accompaniment, he began to play local dances and parties while working as a sharecropper. He first recorded for Okeh Records in 1928, but these were commercial failures. Hurt then drifted out of the recording scene, and he continued his work as a farmer. Tom Hoskins, a blues enthusiast, would be the first to locate Hurt in 1963. He convinced Hurt to relocate to Washington, D.C., where he was recorded by the Library of Congress in 1964. This rediscovery helped further the American folk music revival, which had led to the rediscovery of many other bluesmen of Hurt\\'s era. Hurt entered the same university and coffeehouse concert circuit as his contemporaries, as well as other Delta blues musicians brought out of retirement. As well as playing concerts, he recorded several studio albums for Vanguard Records.\\n\\nBorn John Smith Hurt in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi (there is confusion about his date of birth, but the grave marker mentions March 8, 1892) and raised in Avalon, Mississippi, he learned to play guitar at age nine. He was completely self-taught, stealthily playing the guitar of a friend of his mother\\'s, who often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a lady who lived near by. His style was not reminiscent of any other style being played at the time; it was the way Hurt \"thought the guitar should sound\". He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances, earning a living as a farmhand into the 1920s. His fast, highly syncopated style of playing made his music adept for dancing. On occasion, a medicine show would come through the area; Hurt recalls being wanted by one of them. \"One of them wanted me, but I said no because I just never wanted to get away from home.\" In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith.\\n\\nWhen Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest, he recommended Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning \"Monday Morning Blues\" at his home, he took part in two recording sessions, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). While in Memphis, Hurt recalled seeing \"many, many blues singers ... Lonnie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and lots, lots more.\" Hurt described his first recording session as such: ... a great big hall with only the three of us in it: me, the man [Rockwell], and the engineer. It was really something. I sat on a chair, and they pushed the microphone right up to my mouth and told me that I couldn\\'t move after they had found the right position. I had to keep my head absolutely still. Oh, I was nervous, and my neck was sore for days after. Hurt attempted further negotiations with Okeh to record again, but after the commercial failure of the resulting records, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.\\n\\nAfter Hurt\\'s renditions of \"Frankie\" and \"Spike Driver Blues\" were included in The Anthology of American Folk Music in 1952, and an Australian man discovered a copy of \"Avalon Blues\", there became increased interest in finding Hurt himself. In 1963, a folk musicologist, Tom Hoskins, supervised by Richard Spottswood, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon, Mississippi using the lyrics of \"Avalon Blues\": Avalon, my home town, always on my mind/Avalon, my home town.\\nWhile in Avalon, Hoskins convinced an apprehensive Hurt to perform several songs for him, to ensure that he was genuine. Hoskins was convinced, and seeing that Hurt\\'s guitar playing skills were still intact, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington, D.C., and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges, concert halls, coffee houses and also on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. Much of his repertoire was recorded for the Library of Congress, also. His fans particularly liked the ragtime songs \"Salty Dog\" and \"Candy Man\", and the blues ballads \"Spike Driver Blues\" (a variant of \"John Henry\") and \"Frankie\".\\n\\nHurt incorporated a fast, pick-less, syncopated fingerpicking style that he taught himself. He was influenced by very few people; but did recall an elderly, unrecorded, blues singer from that area, Rufus Hanks, who played twelve-string guitar and harmonica. He also recalled listening to the country singer Jimmie Rodgers. On occasion, Hurt would use an open tuning and a slide, as he did in his arrangement of \"The Ballad of Casey Jones\".\\n\\nHurt\\'s influence spanned several music genres including blues, country, bluegrass, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man, his nature was reflected in the work, which consisted of a mellow mix of country, blues and old time music. Material recorded by Hurt has been re-released by many record labels over the years (see discography); and his influence has extended over many generations of guitarists. Songs recorded by Hurt have been covered by Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Beck, Doc Watson, John McCutcheon, Taj Mahal, Bruce Cockburn, David Johansen, Bill Morrissey and Gillian Welch.\\n\\nHurt died on November 2nd, 1966, of a heart attack in Grenada, Mississippi. There is now a memorial in Avalon, Mississippi for Mississippi John Hurt. It is parallel to RR2, the rural road on which he grew up. American singer-songwriter Tom Paxton, who met Hurt and played on the same bill as him at the Gaslight in Greenwich Village around 1963, wrote and recorded a song about him in 1977 entitled \"Did You Hear John Hurt?\" Paxton still frequently plays this song at his live performances.\\n\\nThe first track of John Fahey\\'s 1968 solo acoustic guitar album Requia is entitled \"Requiem For John Hurt\". Fahey\\'s posthumous live album The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick also features a version of the piece, there entitled \"Requiem For Mississippi John Hurt\". British folk/blues artist Wizz Jones recorded a tribute song called \"Mississippi John\" for his 1977 album Magical Flight. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mississippi+John+Hurt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Singing to a melodious finger-picked accompaniment, he began to play local dances and parties while working as a sharecropper. He first recorded for Okeh Records in 1928, but these were commercial failures. Hurt then drifted out of the recording scene, and he continued his work as a farmer. Tom Hoskins, a blues enthusiast, would be the first to locate Hurt in 1963. He convinced Hurt to relocate to Washington, D.C., where he was recorded by the Library of Congress in 1964. This rediscovery helped further the American folk music revival, which had led to the rediscovery of many other bluesmen of Hurt\\'s era. Hurt entered the same university and coffeehouse concert circuit as his contemporaries, as well as other Delta blues musicians brought out of retirement. As well as playing concerts, he recorded several studio albums for Vanguard Records.\\n\\nBorn John Smith Hurt in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi (there is confusion about his date of birth, but the grave marker mentions March 8, 1892) and raised in Avalon, Mississippi, he learned to play guitar at age nine. He was completely self-taught, stealthily playing the guitar of a friend of his mother\\'s, who often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a lady who lived near by. His style was not reminiscent of any other style being played at the time; it was the way Hurt \"thought the guitar should sound\". He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances, earning a living as a farmhand into the 1920s. His fast, highly syncopated style of playing made his music adept for dancing. On occasion, a medicine show would come through the area; Hurt recalls being wanted by one of them. \"One of them wanted me, but I said no because I just never wanted to get away from home.\" In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith.\\n\\nWhen Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest, he recommended Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning \"Monday Morning Blues\" at his home, he took part in two recording sessions, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). While in Memphis, Hurt recalled seeing \"many, many blues singers ... Lonnie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and lots, lots more.\" Hurt described his first recording session as such: ... a great big hall with only the three of us in it: me, the man [Rockwell], and the engineer. It was really something. I sat on a chair, and they pushed the microphone right up to my mouth and told me that I couldn\\'t move after they had found the right position. I had to keep my head absolutely still. Oh, I was nervous, and my neck was sore for days after. Hurt attempted further negotiations with Okeh to record again, but after the commercial failure of the resulting records, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.\\n\\nAfter Hurt\\'s renditions of \"Frankie\" and \"Spike Driver Blues\" were included in The Anthology of American Folk Music in 1952, and an Australian man discovered a copy of \"Avalon Blues\", there became increased interest in finding Hurt himself. In 1963, a folk musicologist, Tom Hoskins, supervised by Richard Spottswood, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon, Mississippi using the lyrics of \"Avalon Blues\": Avalon, my home town, always on my mind/Avalon, my home town.\\nWhile in Avalon, Hoskins convinced an apprehensive Hurt to perform several songs for him, to ensure that he was genuine. Hoskins was convinced, and seeing that Hurt\\'s guitar playing skills were still intact, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington, D.C., and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges, concert halls, coffee houses and also on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. Much of his repertoire was recorded for the Library of Congress, also. His fans particularly liked the ragtime songs \"Salty Dog\" and \"Candy Man\", and the blues ballads \"Spike Driver Blues\" (a variant of \"John Henry\") and \"Frankie\".\\n\\nHurt incorporated a fast, pick-less, syncopated fingerpicking style that he taught himself. He was influenced by very few people; but did recall an elderly, unrecorded, blues singer from that area, Rufus Hanks, who played twelve-string guitar and harmonica. He also recalled listening to the country singer Jimmie Rodgers. On occasion, Hurt would use an open tuning and a slide, as he did in his arrangement of \"The Ballad of Casey Jones\".\\n\\nHurt\\'s influence spanned several music genres including blues, country, bluegrass, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man, his nature was reflected in the work, which consisted of a mellow mix of country, blues and old time music. Material recorded by Hurt has been re-released by many record labels over the years (see discography); and his influence has extended over many generations of guitarists. Songs recorded by Hurt have been covered by Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Beck, Doc Watson, John McCutcheon, Taj Mahal, Bruce Cockburn, David Johansen, Bill Morrissey and Gillian Welch.\\n\\nHurt died on November 2nd, 1966, of a heart attack in Grenada, Mississippi. There is now a memorial in Avalon, Mississippi for Mississippi John Hurt. It is parallel to RR2, the rural road on which he grew up. American singer-songwriter Tom Paxton, who met Hurt and played on the same bill as him at the Gaslight in Greenwich Village around 1963, wrote and recorded a song about him in 1977 entitled \"Did You Hear John Hurt?\" Paxton still frequently plays this song at his live performances.\\n\\nThe first track of John Fahey\\'s 1968 solo acoustic guitar album Requia is entitled \"Requiem For John Hurt\". Fahey\\'s posthumous live album The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick also features a version of the piece, there entitled \"Requiem For Mississippi John Hurt\". British folk/blues artist Wizz Jones recorded a tribute song called \"Mississippi John\" for his 1977 album Magical Flight. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mississippi+John+Hurt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_de": "John Smith Hurt, besser bekannt als Mississippi John Hurt (* 8. März 1892 in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi; † 2. November 1966 in Grenada, Mississippi) war ein einflussreicher Blues-Sänger und Gitarrist.\n\nAufgewachsen in Avalon, Mississippi, lernte John Hurt mit etwa 10 Jahren Gitarre zu spielen. Während seiner Jugendzeit spielte er häufig für seine Freunde und auf Tanzveranstaltungen. Seinen Lebensunterhalt verdiente Hurt als Farmarbeiter.\n\n1916 war er für fünf Monate Gleisbauarbeiter. Hier lernte er von einem Caller namens Walter Jackson eine A-cappella-Version des später aufgenommenen Spike Driver Blues – einer Variante der Ballade John Henry – kennen.\n\nJohn Hurt musizierte bei einer Gelegenheit mit dem Fiddle-Spieler Willie Narmour, der ihn bei Okeh Records empfahl. In der Folge hatte Hurt 1928 zwei Aufnahmesitzungen für das Plattenlabel, und zwar im Februar in Memphis, Tennessee, und im Dezember in New York. Bei dieser Gelegenheit wurde von den Managern der Plattenfirma aus Werbegründen auch das „Mississippi“ vor den Namen des Musikers gestellt. Ursprünglich wurden nur sieben Titel veröffentlicht, die jedoch kommerziell wenig erfolgreich waren. Gleich wie bei vielen anderen Musikern auch beendete die Weltwirtschaftskrise seine Karriere als Musiker für lange Zeit. Hurt verschwand aus der Öffentlichkeit und arbeitete wieder als Landwirt und Landarbeiter. Auch spielte er weiter als Unterhaltungsmusiker bei lokalen Veranstaltungen.\n\nIn den 1950er und frühen 1960er Jahren kam es in den USA im Rahmen des \"Folk Revivals\" zu einem erneuten Interesse an den frühen Folk-, Blues- und Countryaufnahmen aus den 1920er Jahren. 1963 hörte der Musikforscher Tom Hoskins den im Jahre 1928 aufgenommenen Avalon Blues von John Hurt. Anhand des Textes konnte Hoskins vermuten, dass es sich bei Avalon um die Heimat des Musikers handelte: „Avalon's my hometown / Always on my mind ...“ Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war unbekannt, wo und ob der Musiker überhaupt noch lebte. Da damals aktuelle Karten den Ort Avalon nicht verzeichneten, machte Hoskins das Dorf mit Hilfe von historischen Landkarten ausfindig. Er konnte Hurt aufspüren und überredete ihn zu neuen Aufnahmen, die in Washington eingespielt wurden. Noch im gleichen Jahr trat Hurt auch auf dem Newport Folk Festival auf.\n\nHierauf genoss Mississippi John Hurt während seiner letzten drei Lebensjahre eine enorme Popularität, spielte in Konzerthallen, Hochschulen und Bars und nahm mehrere Alben auf. Der Musiker starb im 75. Lebensjahr am 2. November 1966 infolge eines Herzinfarktes.\n(Wikipedia)",
      "biography_en": "“Mississippi” John Hurt was Born July 3, 1893, Teoc (Carroll County) MS and died November 2, 1966, Grenada, MS. John’s father was Isom Hurt and his mother was Mary Jan McCain. John was one of 3 children. He and his wife, Jessie, had 14 children.\n\n Mississippi John Hurt’s quiet dignity, humor, superb guitar style, and his tender and expressive voice made him one of the most popular artist of traditional country blues re-discovered by the public in the sixties. \n\n John arranged classic American folk and blues songs to entertain his neighbors on Saturday evenings. \n\n Mississippi John never pursued success. In 1928, a mobile unit of the Vocalion company came to Avalon, Mississippi to look for new talents. An audition in Avalon resulted in John being called several months later to go to New York for a recording session under the direction of Lonnie Johnson. The depression led to the reduction in pressing of records and John stayed in Avalon and lived quietly on his farm with his 14 children.\n\n Guided by the words of one of the titles recorded in 1928 by Hurt, “Avalon My Home Town”, the folklorist Tom Hoskins decided in 1963 to go to Avalon. He met Hurt, who was shocked to see that someone remembered his 1928 recordings that had brought him only twenty dollars a song.\n\n John Hurt’s new career lasted only three years, but at Newport Festival, on college campuses, and in the folk clubs of Washington D.C., he displayed his talents as storyteller, entertainer, and singer. He overwhelmed the public with his outstanding mastery of the guitar.",

      "bio_content": "John Smith Hurt, better known as Mississippi John Hurt (July 3, 1893 or March 8, 1892 - November 2, 1966) was an American country blues singer and guitarist.\n\nRaised in Avalon, Mississippi, Hurt taught himself how to play the guitar around age nine. Singing to a melodious finger-picked accompaniment, he began to play local dances and parties while working as a sharecropper. He first recorded for Okeh Records in 1928, but these were commercial failures. Hurt then drifted out of the recording scene, and he continued his work as a farmer. Tom Hoskins, a blues enthusiast, would be the first to locate Hurt in 1963. He convinced Hurt to relocate to Washington, D.C., where he was recorded by the Library of Congress in 1964. This rediscovery helped further the American folk music revival, which had led to the rediscovery of many other bluesmen of Hurt's era. Hurt entered the same university and coffeehouse concert circuit as his contemporaries, as well as other Delta blues musicians brought out of retirement. As well as playing concerts, he recorded several studio albums for Vanguard Records.\n\nBorn John Smith Hurt in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi (there is confusion about his date of birth, but the grave marker mentions March 8, 1892) and raised in Avalon, Mississippi, he learned to play guitar at age nine. He was completely self-taught, stealthily playing the guitar of a friend of his mother's, who often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a lady who lived near by. His style was not reminiscent of any other style being played at the time; it was the way Hurt \"thought the guitar should sound\". He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances, earning a living as a farmhand into the 1920s. His fast, highly syncopated style of playing made his music adept for dancing. On occasion, a medicine show would come through the area; Hurt recalls being wanted by one of them. \"One of them wanted me, but I said no because I just never wanted to get away from home.\" In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith.\n\nWhen Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest, he recommended Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning \"Monday Morning Blues\" at his home, he took part in two recording sessions, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). While in Memphis, Hurt recalled seeing \"many, many blues singers ... Lonnie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and lots, lots more.\" Hurt described his first recording session as such: ... a great big hall with only the three of us in it: me, the man [Rockwell], and the engineer. It was really something. I sat on a chair, and they pushed the microphone right up to my mouth and told me that I couldn't move after they had found the right position. I had to keep my head absolutely still. Oh, I was nervous, and my neck was sore for days after. Hurt attempted further negotiations with Okeh to record again, but after the commercial failure of the resulting records, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.\n\nAfter Hurt's renditions of \"Frankie\" and \"Spike Driver Blues\" were included in The Anthology of American Folk Music in 1952, and an Australian man discovered a copy of \"Avalon Blues\", there became increased interest in finding Hurt himself. In 1963, a folk musicologist, Tom Hoskins, supervised by Richard Spottswood, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon, Mississippi using the lyrics of \"Avalon Blues\": Avalon, my home town, always on my mind/Avalon, my home town.\nWhile in Avalon, Hoskins convinced an apprehensive Hurt to perform several songs for him, to ensure that he was genuine. Hoskins was convinced, and seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington, D.C., and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges, concert halls, coffee houses and also on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. Much of his repertoire was recorded for the Library of Congress, also. His fans particularly liked the ragtime songs \"Salty Dog\" and \"Candy Man\", and the blues ballads \"Spike Driver Blues\" (a variant of \"John Henry\") and \"Frankie\".\n\nHurt incorporated a fast, pick-less, syncopated fingerpicking style that he taught himself. He was influenced by very few people; but did recall an elderly, unrecorded, blues singer from that area, Rufus Hanks, who played twelve-string guitar and harmonica. He also recalled listening to the country singer Jimmie Rodgers. On occasion, Hurt would use an open tuning and a slide, as he did in his arrangement of \"The Ballad of Casey Jones\".\n\nHurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues, country, bluegrass, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man, his nature was reflected in the work, which consisted of a mellow mix of country, blues and old time music. Material recorded by Hurt has been re-released by many record labels over the years (see discography); and his influence has extended over many generations of guitarists. Songs recorded by Hurt have been covered by Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Beck, Doc Watson, John McCutcheon, Taj Mahal, Bruce Cockburn, David Johansen, Bill Morrissey and Gillian Welch.\n\nHurt died on November 2nd, 1966, of a heart attack in Grenada, Mississippi. There is now a memorial in Avalon, Mississippi for Mississippi John Hurt. It is parallel to RR2, the rural road on which he grew up. American singer-songwriter Tom Paxton, who met Hurt and played on the same bill as him at the Gaslight in Greenwich Village around 1963, wrote and recorded a song about him in 1977 entitled \"Did You Hear John Hurt?\" Paxton still frequently plays this song at his live performances.\n\nThe first track of John Fahey's 1968 solo acoustic guitar album Requia is entitled \"Requiem For John Hurt\". Fahey's posthumous live album The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick also features a version of the piece, there entitled \"Requiem For Mississippi John Hurt\".

      "bio_summary": "John Smith Hurt, better known as Mississippi John Hurt (July 3, 1893 or March 8, 1892 - November 2, 1966) was an American country blues singer and guitarist.\n\nRaised in Avalon, Mississippi, Hurt taught himself how to play the guitar around age nine. Singing to a melodious finger-picked accompaniment, he began to play local dances and parties while working as a sharecropper. He first recorded for Okeh Records in 1928, but these were commercial failures. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mississippi+John+Hurt\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

      "biography_de": "John Smith Hurt, besser bekannt als Mississippi John Hurt (* 8. März 1892 in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi; † 2. November 1966 in Grenada, Mississippi) war ein einflussreicher Blues-Sänger und Gitarrist.\n\nAufgewachsen in Avalon, Mississippi, lernte John Hurt mit etwa 10 Jahren Gitarre zu spielen. Während seiner Jugendzeit spielte er häufig für seine Freunde und auf Tanzveranstaltungen. Seinen Lebensunterhalt verdiente Hurt als Farmarbeiter.\n\n1916 war er für fünf Monate Gleisbauarbeiter. Hier lernte er von einem Caller namens Walter Jackson eine A-cappella-Version des später aufgenommenen Spike Driver Blues – einer Variante der Ballade John Henry – kennen.\n\nJohn Hurt musizierte bei einer Gelegenheit mit dem Fiddle-Spieler Willie Narmour, der ihn bei Okeh Records empfahl. In der Folge hatte Hurt 1928 zwei Aufnahmesitzungen für das Plattenlabel, und zwar im Februar in Memphis, Tennessee, und im Dezember in New York. Bei dieser Gelegenheit wurde von den Managern der Plattenfirma aus Werbegründen auch das „Mississippi“ vor den Namen des Musikers gestellt. Ursprünglich wurden nur sieben Titel veröffentlicht, die jedoch kommerziell wenig erfolgreich waren. Gleich wie bei vielen anderen Musikern auch beendete die Weltwirtschaftskrise seine Karriere als Musiker für lange Zeit. Hurt verschwand aus der Öffentlichkeit und arbeitete wieder als Landwirt und Landarbeiter. Auch spielte er weiter als Unterhaltungsmusiker bei lokalen Veranstaltungen.\n\nIn den 1950er und frühen 1960er Jahren kam es in den USA im Rahmen des \"Folk Revivals\" zu einem erneuten Interesse an den frühen Folk-, Blues- und Countryaufnahmen aus den 1920er Jahren. 1963 hörte der Musikforscher Tom Hoskins den im Jahre 1928 aufgenommenen Avalon Blues von John Hurt. Anhand des Textes konnte Hoskins vermuten, dass es sich bei Avalon um die Heimat des Musikers handelte: „Avalon's my hometown / Always on my mind ...“ Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war unbekannt, wo und ob der Musiker überhaupt noch lebte. Da damals aktuelle Karten den Ort Avalon nicht verzeichneten, machte Hoskins das Dorf mit Hilfe von historischen Landkarten ausfindig. Er konnte Hurt aufspüren und überredete ihn zu neuen Aufnahmen, die in Washington eingespielt wurden. Noch im gleichen Jahr trat Hurt auch auf dem Newport Folk Festival auf.\n\nHierauf genoss Mississippi John Hurt während seiner letzten drei Lebensjahre eine enorme Popularität, spielte in Konzerthallen, Hochschulen und Bars und nahm mehrere Alben auf. Der Musiker starb im 75. Lebensjahr am 2. November 1966 infolge eines Herzinfarktes.\n(Wikipedia)",
      "biography_en": "“Mississippi” John Hurt was Born July 3, 1893, Teoc (Carroll County) MS and died November 2, 1966, Grenada, MS. John’s father was Isom Hurt and his mother was Mary Jan McCain. John was one of 3 children. He and his wife, Jessie, had 14 children.\n\n Mississippi John Hurt’s quiet dignity, humor, superb guitar style, and his tender and expressive voice made him one of the most popular artist of traditional country blues re-discovered by the public in the sixties. \n\n John arranged classic American folk and blues songs to entertain his neighbors on Saturday evenings. \n\n Mississippi John never pursued success. In 1928, a mobile unit of the Vocalion company came to Avalon, Mississippi to look for new talents. An audition in Avalon resulted in John being called several months later to go to New York for a recording session under the direction of Lonnie Johnson. The depression led to the reduction in pressing of records and John stayed in Avalon and lived quietly on his farm with his 14 children.\n\n Guided by the words of one of the titles recorded in 1928 by Hurt, “Avalon My Home Town”, the folklorist Tom Hoskins decided in 1963 to go to Avalon. He met Hurt, who was shocked to see that someone remembered his 1928 recordings that had brought him only twenty dollars a song.\n\n John Hurt’s new career lasted only three years, but at Newport Festival, on college campuses, and in the folk clubs of Washington D.C., he displayed his talents as storyteller, entertainer, and singer. He overwhelmed the public with his outstanding mastery of the guitar.",
