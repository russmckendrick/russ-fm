      "biography": "Fugazi are an American post-hardcore band that formed in Washington, D.C., in 1986. The band consists of guitarists and vocalists Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, bassist Joe Lally, and drummer Brendan Canty. They are noted for their style-transcending music, DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice and contempt for the music industry.\n\nSince its inception, Fugazi has been self-managed and have released almost all their material through Dischord Records, an independent label founded by MacKaye and partner Jeff Nelson in 1980. The band maintained a policy of affordable access to their work through low record and ticket prices and all-ages concerts.\n\nSays AMG All Music Guide, \"Along with their stridently underground ethics — which were more out of pragmatism and modesty than anything else — they gained an extremely loyal and numerous global following. To many, Fugazi meant as much to them as Bob Dylan did to their parents.\" \n\nThey played their first show in the fall of 1987 and since then released 7 albums and toured the world extensively covering all 50 United States, Europe, Australia, South America, Japan and many points in between.\n\nIn addition to their recorded output Fugazi released a documentary film/video called \"Instrument\" in collaboration with independent filmmaker, Jem Cohen. The feature length video offers a documentary overview of the the band's career with footage shot in a variety of formats over the last 10 years combining concert, tour and studio material backed with a musical soundtrack by the band unique to the movie.\n\nFugazi's last musical releases were The Argument, a 10 song LP, and Furniture, a 3 song single, released in the Fall of 2001. These sessions marked the first studio appearance of long time roadie and second drummer Jerry Busher who played additional drums and percussion on a number of the tracks on both releases. The recordings were once again made in collaboration with long time Fugazi engineer Don Zientara at Inner Ear studios.\n\nPrior to forming Fugazi, the members of the band played in various other bands with releases available on Dischord. \n\nFugazi are currently on hiatus as of 2002, with Mackaye in The Evens, Picciotto having produced various bands including Blonde Redhead and The Blood Brothers, and Lally playing with John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer on both Ataxia releases and working on a solo album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fugazi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "Recorded in early 2001, and released just after the world began to fall apart that September, <i>The Argument</i> was Fugazi’s final album before going on indefinite hiatus in late 2002. By this point, the band had figured out how to use the studio. And even though the four members of Fugazi had proved to be dynamic live performers—reinventing and re-energising their material on the road—<i>The Argument</i> found them expanding their sound to include elements that couldn’t easily be reproduced onstage: Deeper background vocals, acoustic guitars, even the occasional cello (courtesy of Amy Domingues). Maybe the band members knew their touring days would end soon, and weren’t sweating how <i>The Argument</i> would play live. Or maybe this is just the kind of confidence and skill that naturally results from being one of the greatest rock acts of the late 20th century. \n\n<i>The Argument</i> gets down to business right away with “Cashout”, a blistering track that rips apart heartless landlords. These guys can still explode when they want to: Guy Picciotto’s scream on “Full Disclosure” (“Iwantout Iwantout Iwantout!”) and Ian MacKaye’s equally anguished cries on “Epic Problem” (“STOPSTOPSTOPSTOP!”) are as sweaty as anything from the band’s late-1980s output. And while the band’s anger is evident on <i>The Argument</i>, fuller musical textures are the rule rather than the exception, as evidenced by “Strangelight”, which might—just <i>might</i>—be a genuinely sensual love song. As for the album’s psychic insight into what late-2001 American life might feel like—well, let’s just say it was downright chilling to hear the lines “Some punk could argue some moral ABCs/When people are catching what bombers release” that winter. \n\nStill, no line captures the innate ferocity of <i>The Argument</i>—and of Fugazi’s entire career—as the title track, which closes the album. “I’m on a mission to never agree,” MacKaye sings. Few bands have ever embodied “Yeah? BULLSHIT!” as clearly and completely.",

It was recorded at Don Zientara's Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, VA and the Dischord House between January and April 2001. It was the band's last release (simultaneously with the Furniture EP) before going on hiatus in 2003.\n\nThe Argument saw Fugazi continue to expand upon the more experimental art punk leanings of Red Medicine and End Hits while also heavily incorporating other instruments, such as piano and cello into their sound.The album also featured the first extensive contributions from outside musicians, most notably longtime stage-tech Jerry Busher, who added percussion on a second drum set to several of the album's songs as well as Kathi Wilcox of Bikini Kill and Bridget Cross of Unrest who provided additional backing vocals.\n\nFugazi began work on The Argument in 1999. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member brought his own riffs and ideas to the band, jammed on them, and then began piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on the final versions. The album's recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at Inner Ear Studios and Dischord House in Arlington, Virginia. The band once again worked with Zientara. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song's production, in particular the album's drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel. Canty told Modern Drummer, \"We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different drum kits, cymbals, snares, and ways of miking.\"\n\nArion Berger of Rolling Stone called the album \"bracing\" and \"intellectual\" and Chris True of AllMusic \"spine-tingling and ear-shattering all at once\", writing, \"the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fugazi/The+Argument\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at Don Zientara's Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, VA and the Dischord House between January and April 2001. It was the band's last release (simultaneously with the Furniture EP) before going on hiatus in 2003. The Argument saw Fugazi continue to expand upon the more experimental art punk leanings of Red Medicine and End Hits while also heavily incorporating other instruments, such as piano and cello into their sound.The album also featured the first extensive contributions from <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fugazi/The+Argument\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
