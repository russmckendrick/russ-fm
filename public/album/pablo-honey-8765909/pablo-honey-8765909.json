      "biography": "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

      "editorial_notes": "No matter how sardonic he was, there’s still something shocking about hearing Thom Yorke sneer “Grow my hair/I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison” halfway through Radiohead’s second single, “Anyone Can Play Guitar”. The Lizard King was Yorke’s proxy for all the preening and puffery of conventional rock ’n’ roll—of what it took for the record industry to take you seriously. Yorke was in his mid-20s when Radiohead cut its debut album, 1993’s <i>Pablo Honey</i>, over the course of three weeks in Oxfordshire. He was an angry young man, teeming with ire for the state of rock and pop. “I don’t like to be cynical, but if that really is the best that pop music can do in the space of a year or two,” he said of the band Suede in a 1993 interview, “then there’s no hope for the world.”\n\nThing was, though, for all the potshots, Radiohead started out as a rather conventional—but still very good—guitar-rock band, suspended between the emerging Britpop of their island brethren like Suede and the stateside churn of bands like Dinosaur Jr. But the band members didn’t lack ambition. They wanted to get big—they just didn’t want to get bloated. “The idea was to cut straight through all that paying-your-dues [stuff],” Yorke said in the same interview, “and get the whole world to see us… I like that breadth of vision.”\n\n<i>Pablo Honey</i> did get the world’s attention—even if now, decades later, it’s clearly the sound of a band still trying to define itself. Borrowing melodically from Neil Young, “Prove Yourself” rises from weepy struggles with self-esteem to a mantric march about doing exactly what the title suggests. “Stop Whispering”, meanwhile, is a protest song against the aging social order, one that builds into a mighty crescendo, with Yorke screaming wordlessly into his mighty band’s clatter. These songs and others—“You”, “Ripcord” and even the acoustic lament “Thinking About You”—would fit squarely in an international survey of early-1990s alternative rock.\n\nThere are, however, whiffs of what Radiohead would soon become. A surprise worldwide hit, “Creep” proved the band could not only confront brutal truths, but that Yorke and his bandmates could sculpt abrasion while making it magnetic. Then there’s the delicacy of “Lurgee”, where shimmering guitars reflect off Philip Selway’s smart cymbal work, as Yorke turns to face the future without someone he once thought he needed. It appropriately arrives near <i>Pablo Honey</i>’s end, just as Radiohead launched one of rock music’s most revolutionary run of records ever.",

          "wiki": {
            "content": "Pablo Honey is the first studio album by English alternative rock band Radiohead, first released in early 1993. The album's title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says, \"Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!\" to his victim. This snippet is sampled by the band in the song \"How Do You?\". The album includes the single \"Creep\", Radiohead's most well-known hit on mainstream radio. Pablo Honey peaked at #22 in the UK charts and went platinum there and in other countries.\n\nAfter a long dormancy while the members attended university, the band On a Friday reconvened in the early 1990s, becoming fixtures on the local Oxford scene with a series of demo recordings and well attended live gigs, finally signing with EMI/Parlophone and changing their name to Radiohead. The band's first official release, the Drill EP, was produced by their managers Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge, and sold poorly. For their debut album the band sought the production skills of Massachusetts-based Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, responsible for Dinosaur Jr. and Buffalo Tom albums of which they were fans.\n\nSeveral months in advance of the album, the band came out with their debut single \"Creep\". According to bassist Colin Greenwood, \"Creep\" had been written by singer/rhythm guitarist Thom Yorke sometime in the late 1980s, while he was at Exeter University, and was shared with other members of the band, who were mostly very enthusiastic, citing the song as a reason to continue making music together. However, it was not included on any of their early '90s demo tapes and had not been a part of their live set. At the time, \"Inside My Head\" (which would later be released as a b-side to \"Creep\") was considered a good candidate for the band's lead single.\n\nSometime in 1992 the band began an impromptu performance of \"Creep\" at a recording session, referring to it as their \"Scott Walker song\" because it reminded them of one of their musical idols. Rumour states that Jonny Greenwood's famous guitar crunches in the chorus were supposedly an attempt to ruin a song he didn't like. But \"Jonny played the piano at the end of the song and it was gorgeous,\" stated producer Paul Kolderie (though the piano was mixed in at the wrong time, the band decided to keep the take complete with mistake, not for the last time). \"Everyone who heard 'Creep' just started going insane. So that's what got us the job doing the album.\" As soon as their managers and producers realized the song was an original (not a Walker cover), other plans were put on the back burner, to the band's surprise, and \"Creep\" was released as a limited single to the public in late 1992. However, the single initially went nowhere. It was even blacklisted from Radio 1 for being too depressing. In the meantime the bulk of the album was recorded, in autumn 1992. Recording sessions were completed very quickly, as the band had been playing many of these songs for years. However, what ended up on Pablo Honey represents only a fraction of their On a Friday-era recorded material, with very little overlap with earlier demos. The album was once described by a Radiohead member as 'Our greatest hits as an unsigned band', with smooth sonic textures, anthemic vocals and walls of guitar noise. \"Prove Yourself\", which had led off Drill, reappears however in a different recording, as do \"You\" and \"Thinking About You\" in reworked versions.\n\nIn the heady alternative musical climate of 1993, Pablo Honey did not receive particular attention. Upon release, however, the critical reaction to Pablo Honey tended towards the positive, with Rolling Stone, NME, Allmusic, Q Magazine and Entertainment Weekly giving favourable reviews.\n\nBesides \"Creep\", the album also included the melodic, perhaps ironic, and Sonic Youth-influenced single \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" and U2-like single \"Stop Whispering\". Also on Pablo Honey are ethereal rocker \"You\", acoustic ballad \"Thinking About You\", and \"Blow Out\", the latter of which is apparently the band's personal favourite from the album, and points ahead to their future sonic manipulations.\n\nBy mid-1993, \"Creep\" had become a hit in Israel, then the United States, and then a worldwide hit, finally reaching number 7 when it was re-released during the Autumn of 1993 in the band's native Britain. \"Creep\" went on to define the band's early career, at the expense of anything else on Pablo Honey. The song, whose self-loathing lyrics struck a chord with many fans, was released around the same time as other so-called \"slacker\" anthems such as Beck's \"Loser\" and was seen by some as a part of the grunge movement kicked into high gear by Seattle bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Radiohead eventually fell into a media-created niche as the \"British Nirvana\", due both to \"Creep\" and to the equally morose (if not equally successful) other songs on the album. In fact, Radiohead did share similar influences as Nirvana, notably the Pixies and R.E.M., although The Smiths were also a large influence on the band at this time. By their next album, The Bends (1995), Radiohead was more often being lumped by the press with the Britpop or \"Brit-rock\" movement, a reflection of changing trends.\n\nHowever, the band are not unanimously pleased with \"Creep\". Although at first ecstatic at their success, they soon came to resent being unable to escape its shadow, inspiring the bitter song \"My Iron Lung\". When performing live in 1993 and 1994, much of the audience would often leave after \"Creep\" had been performed, ignoring all the other material from Pablo Honey.

The clip for \"Creep\" was conspicuously absent from their official 1997 video compilation release 7 Television Commercials (none of the other videos from Pablo Honey were included, either). For a time, the band refused to play it live, but beginning in 2001 it has been aired several times as an encore.

The band, however, have said in recent years that they are not unhappy with the album or its production, given their lack of experience at the time. Radiohead members have mentioned \"Blow Out\" as the Pablo Honey track of which they are most proud.

      "wiki_content": "Pablo Honey is the first studio album by English alternative rock band Radiohead, first released in early 1993. The album's title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says, \"Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!\" to his victim. This snippet is sampled by the band in the song \"How Do You?\". The album includes the single \"Creep\", Radiohead's most well-known hit on mainstream radio. Pablo Honey peaked at #22 in the UK charts and went platinum there and in other countries.\n\nAfter a long dormancy while the members attended university, the band On a Friday reconvened in the early 1990s, becoming fixtures on the local Oxford scene with a series of demo recordings and well attended live gigs, finally signing with EMI/Parlophone and changing their name to Radiohead. The band's first official release, the Drill EP, was produced by their managers Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge, and sold poorly. For their debut album the band sought the production skills of Massachusetts-based Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, responsible for Dinosaur Jr. and Buffalo Tom albums of which they were fans.\n\nSeveral months in advance of the album, the band came out with their debut single \"Creep\". According to bassist Colin Greenwood, \"Creep\" had been written by singer/rhythm guitarist Thom Yorke sometime in the late 1980s, while he was at Exeter University, and was shared with other members of the band, who were mostly very enthusiastic, citing the song as a reason to continue making music together. However, it was not included on any of their early '90s demo tapes and had not been a part of their live set. At the time, \"Inside My Head\" (which would later be released as a b-side to \"Creep\") was considered a good candidate for the band's lead single.\n\nSometime in 1992 the band began an impromptu performance of \"Creep\" at a recording session, referring to it as their \"Scott Walker song\" because it reminded them of one of their musical idols. Rumour states that Jonny Greenwood's famous guitar crunches in the chorus were supposedly an attempt to ruin a song he didn't like. But \"Jonny played the piano at the end of the song and it was gorgeous,\" stated producer Paul Kolderie (though the piano was mixed in at the wrong time, the band decided to keep the take complete with mistake, not for the last time). \"Everyone who heard 'Creep' just started going insane. So that's what got us the job doing the album.\" As soon as their managers and producers realized the song was an original (not a Walker cover), other plans were put on the back burner, to the band's surprise, and \"Creep\" was released as a limited single to the public in late 1992. However, the single initially went nowhere. It was even blacklisted from Radio 1 for being too depressing. In the meantime the bulk of the album was recorded, in autumn 1992. Recording sessions were completed very quickly, as the band had been playing many of these songs for years. However, what ended up on Pablo Honey represents only a fraction of their On a Friday-era recorded material, with very little overlap with earlier demos. The album was once described by a Radiohead member as 'Our greatest hits as an unsigned band', with smooth sonic textures, anthemic vocals and walls of guitar noise. \"Prove Yourself\", which had led off Drill, reappears however in a different recording, as do \"You\" and \"Thinking About You\" in reworked versions.\n\nIn the heady alternative musical climate of 1993, Pablo Honey did not receive particular attention. Upon release, however, the critical reaction to Pablo Honey tended towards the positive, with Rolling Stone, NME, Allmusic, Q Magazine and Entertainment Weekly giving favourable reviews.\n\nBesides \"Creep\", the album also included the melodic, perhaps ironic, and Sonic Youth-influenced single \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" and U2-like single \"Stop Whispering\". Also on Pablo Honey are ethereal rocker \"You\", acoustic ballad \"Thinking About You\", and \"Blow Out\", the latter of which is apparently the band's personal favourite from the album, and points ahead to their future sonic manipulations.\n\nBy mid-1993, \"Creep\" had become a hit in Israel, then the United States, and then a worldwide hit, finally reaching number 7 when it was re-released during the Autumn of 1993 in the band's native Britain. \"Creep\" went on to define the band's early career, at the expense of anything else on Pablo Honey. The song, whose self-loathing lyrics struck a chord with many fans, was released around the same time as other so-called \"slacker\" anthems such as Beck's \"Loser\" and was seen by some as a part of the grunge movement kicked into high gear by Seattle bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Radiohead eventually fell into a media-created niche as the \"British Nirvana\", due both to \"Creep\" and to the equally morose (if not equally successful) other songs on the album. In fact, Radiohead did share similar influences as Nirvana, notably the Pixies and R.E.M., although The Smiths were also a large influence on the band at this time. By their next album, The Bends (1995), Radiohead was more often being lumped by the press with the Britpop or \"Brit-rock\" movement, a reflection of changing trends.\n\nHowever, the band are not unanimously pleased with \"Creep\".

When performing live in 1993 and 1994, much of the audience would often leave after \"Creep\" had been performed, ignoring all the other material from Pablo Honey.
