      "biography": "There are 3 artists named Mew:\n\n1) Mew is an alternative rock band which formed in Hellerup, Denmark in 1995. The band consists of Jonas Bjerre (vocals), Johan Wohlert, and Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen (drums).  Wohlert left the band in 2006, but returned in 2014, and is featured on all subsequent releases. When on tour, Mew is supported by Dr. Nick Watts (Headswim) on keyboard, and Mads Wegner on guitar  (original guitarist Bo Madsen (guitar) left the band in 2015.) The band's music can be described as experimental pop or as singer Jonas Bjerre mentioned in a recent interview: \"I think that we combine pop music with something that's much more experimental, in our own way. I don't think I would even try and describe it. It's difficult.\" Guitarist Bo Madsen has also classified Mew's music as \"indie stadium\".\n\nThe members of Mew started playing music together in 1995.  Mew first achieved success in Denmark with their album Frengers, although their debut album, A Triumph for Man, had been met with much critical acclaim back in 1997. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year.\" Until this point Mew was relatively unknown outside of Denmark; however after a European tour supporting R.E.M. Mew began to attract wider attention. After releasing the critically-acclaimed album And The Glass Handed Kites, featuring contributions from J Mascis from Dinosaur Jr, Mew has built on their success in Denmark as well as attracting attention from other countries in Europe and Asia. In the summer of 2006, they toured as the supporting act for Bloc Party in the U.S. as well as for Kasabian in the U.S. and Canada in the fall.

They released their seventh studio album, Visuals, after releasing a few singles in the months preceding its release. They embarked on tours for the album, as well as a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of their breakthrough album Frengers in 2018. \n\nDiscography:\n    * A Triumph for Man (1997, re-released 2006)\n    * Half the World Is Watching Me (2000, re-released Aug 2007)\n    * Frengers (2003)\n    * And the Glass Handed Kites (2005)\n    * No More Stories...

It was released 19 September 2005 in Denmark, 26 September 2005 in the rest of Europe and 26 July 2006 in the United States.\n\nCompared to previous Mew albums, this album is unique in that the structure is built upon as if it was a single continuous suite. The album has been called 'one long song', an allusion to the tracks' unnoticed transitions.\n\nThe album has been well received by critics, with Pitchfork calling it \"a terrific accomplishment\". The album has won Mew several prizes in Denmark, including four Danish Music Awards.} It also features at the top of Danish music magazine Gaffa's list of best albums of 2005.\n\nThe working title for the album was \"Saviours of Jazz Ballet\", but even before they thought about calling it \"Circuitry of the Wolf\".\n\nDespite not having been released as a single, the track \"The Zookeeper's Boy\" gained massive popularity with the biggest radio station in Denmark, P3, playing the track intensively. This made it the \"Hit of the Year\" in various polls, and when Gaffa, the biggest Danish music magazine, made a poll, it took first place, with the actual single \"Special\" coming in second. It was later released as a single due to popular demand.\n\nThe album's cover has earned it the dubious honor of being the second album named in Pitchfork Media's \"Your Cover's Blown,\" a column devoted to poor album art. And also in Pitchfork Media's \"Top 25 Worst Album Covers of 2006\".\n\nThis was the last album to feature bassist Johan Wohlert, who left the band the following year to focus on being a father.\n\nPromo versions of And the Glass Handed Kites were selling for around £60 ($120) a piece on eBay months before the official release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mew/And+the+Glass+Handed+Kites\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released 19 September 2005 in Denmark, 26 September 2005 in the rest of Europe and 26 July 2006 in the United States.\n\nCompared to previous Mew albums, this album is unique in that the structure is built upon as if it was a single continuous suite. The album has been called 'one long song', an allusion to the tracks' unnoticed transitions.\n\nThe album has been well received by critics, with Pitchfork calling it \"a terrific accomplishment\". The album has won Mew several prizes in Denmark, including four Danish Music Awards.} It also features at the top of Danish music magazine Gaffa's list of best albums of 2005.\n\nThe working title for the album was \"Saviours of Jazz Ballet\", but even before they thought about calling it \"Circuitry of the Wolf\".\n\nDespite not having been released as a single, the track \"The Zookeeper's Boy\" gained massive popularity with the biggest radio station in Denmark, P3, playing the track intensively. This made it the \"Hit of the Year\" in various polls, and when Gaffa, the biggest Danish music magazine, made a poll, it took first place, with the actual single \"Special\" coming in second. It was later released as a single due to popular demand.\n\nThe album's cover has earned it the dubious honor of being the second album named in Pitchfork Media's \"Your Cover's Blown,\" a column devoted to poor album art. And also in Pitchfork Media's \"Top 25 Worst Album Covers of 2006\".\n\nThis was the last album to feature bassist Johan Wohlert, who left the band the following year to focus on being a father.\n\nPromo versions of And the Glass Handed Kites were selling for around £60 ($120) a piece on eBay months before the official release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mew/And+the+Glass+Handed+Kites\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
