      "biography": "Steven Paul “Elliott” Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his “whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery” and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies. \n\nAfter playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song “Miss Misery”, included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.\n\nSmith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.",

But there were also breakups, addictions, interventions and accidents that may have been suicide attempts—all real-life manifestations of the darkness in Smith’s songs that, in turn, drove <i>more</i> dark songs. All of which were no doubt weighing on the singer as he began work on his second major-label album.\n\nReleased in 2000, just three years before Smith’s death, <i>Figure 8</i> is a complicated collection, an album that captures the singer’s contradictory feelings about his past and present, as well as his encyclopedic enthusiasm for rock’s glory days. It’s an album in which a lightly sparkling tune like “L.A.”—an ode to stepping back from the brink of the abyss and stepping into sunshine—can sit right next to the tender and heartbreaking “Everything Means Nothing to Me” (Smith sculpted that song’s crystalline structure at a piano as blood dripped down his arm; he’d just carved the word “NOW” into his skin, to protest his record label’s worries about his future). That sort of emotional back-and-forth can be found throughout <i>Figure 8</i>: The wry self-loathing of “Wouldn’t Mama Be Proud?” is followed by the grim persistence of “Color Bars”, and the future ache of “Better Be Quiet Now” is featured alongside the defeated “Can’t Make a Sound”.\n\nSmith talked about <i>Figure 8</i> as a dream diary, or a sequence of “little movies”. The rock wallop of “Son of Sam” gives way to the acoustic grace of “Somebody That I Used to Know”, while the crackling despair of “Stupidity Tries” sets up the string-swept plea of “Easy Way Out”. He never sits still for more than a few minutes, gliding among styles as though the act of recording was a carousel. <i>Figure 8</i>, then, can feel vertiginous and restless. But it’s also the unmitigated transmission of a feverish mind trying to counter pain by making something beautiful and giving it away. Though <i>Figure 8</i> would prove to be Smith’s final finished album, it’s the sound of a true musical zealot as he tries to map his mind in the studio.",
