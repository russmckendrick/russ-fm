      "biography": "The Vaselines are an indie pop band from Glasgow, Scotland. Formed in 1986, the band was originally made up of only vocalists/guitarists Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, but later added James Seenan and Eugene's brother Charlie Kelly on bass and drums respectively from the band Secession. McKee had formerly been a member of a band named The Pretty Flowers with Duglas T. Stewart (later of BMX Bandits), Norman Blake (later of Teenage Fanclub) and Sean Dickson (later of The Soup Dragons). Eugene had formerly played in The Famous Monsters.  Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain once described Kelly and McKee as his \"most favorite songwriters in the whole world\".  The band released two singles, \"Son of a Gun\" and \"Dying for It\", prior to releasing an album. In 1989 they released their only album, Dum Dum, on the record label Rough Trade. Following the closing of the record label 53rd and 3rd, which they had originally signed to, the band broke up in 1990. However, they reunited later that year to open for Nirvana when they played in Edinburgh.  Though they were not widely known when the band existed, covers of their songs by Nirvana and Kurt Cobain's tendency to mention them as an influence brought exposure to the band. With their songs \"Son of a Gun\" and \"Molly's Lips\" covered on Nirvana's album Incesticide and \"Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam\" covered as \"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam\" on MTV Unplugged in New York, the band gained a new audience from people who wanted to discover the bands that influenced Cobain (a similar situation happened to the band The Meat Puppets). Due to this new exposure, in 1992 Sub Pop released The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History, a compilation that contained The Vaselines' entire body of work on one album.  No longer together, members of the band moved on to new bands. Kelly went on to found the band Captain America (later renamed Eugenius). He currently performs solo. McKee founded the band Suckle and released her first solo album, Sunny Moon, in 2006.  In 2008, the band reformed and began to make sporadic appearences at festivals in the United Kingdom and the United States and various tours supporting Belle and Sebastian. The band will perform at the Belle and Sebastian's second Bowlie Weekender festival in December 2010.  In 2010, the band announced they would release their second album \"Sex With An X\" on September 14, 2010 on Sub Pop Records.",

Flash-forward to 2010 and the duo reunite with a new album and it’s a wonderful collection of skeletal pop songs sung with an ear towards simple hooks and perfectly scripted instrumentation. There are no wasted notes. The vocal interplay is ingenuous. “The Devil’s Inside Me” and “Turning It On” are great male-to-female pieces of sexual tension. The title track is a handclap-fueled ultra-catchy pop song. “Overweight But Over You” is exactly the kind of churning power-pop song that Cobain himself tried to write so many times. “I Hate the ‘80s” gears up with splendid 1960s guitars to mock the decade where the best music was often driven underground and left unheard. “Whitechapel” adds an extra sheen of sophistication right before the garage-rock-cum-country glee of “My God Is Bigger Than Your God.” Exquisite.",
