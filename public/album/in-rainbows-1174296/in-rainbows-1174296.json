      "biography": "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

      "editorial_notes": "For those who grew up during the streaming era, it may be impossible to grasp just how monumental the announcement of Radiohead’s seventh album, <i>In Rainbows</i>, seemed in 2007. But in early October, guitarist Jonny Greenwood logged onto the band’s blog to announce that not only was the group’s long-awaited new record finished, but that it would be available online in 10 days—and that fans could pay whatever they wanted for the files (including, well, nothing). Debates have raged about the consequences of Radiohead’s decision ever since, but it was a bold response to the onslaught of digital piracy. Radiohead had fulfilled its contract with EMI, becoming one of the world’s biggest rock bands in the world. What did the band members have to lose by seeing how much listeners actually valued their music?\n\nThough that decision dominated headlines, <i>In Rainbows</i> presented another bit of unexpected upheaval in Radiohead’s world: After years of in-studio sonic experimentation, the group had come back to earth, making a 10-song, 42-minute record with actual, you know, <i>singles</i>. And <i>guitars</i>. And lyrics about loneliness and love and yearning. This was Radiohead reverting to its past—slightly. Sure, you could hear the experimental vapours of <i>Kid A</i> in the tessellated textures of “Reckoner” and the skitters of “15 Step”. And you could sense the luminous aggression of <i>Hail to the Thief</i> in the caterwauls of “Bodysnatchers”. But then there was the gorgeous-if-fretful “Nude”, a song Radiohead had been trying to get right for a decade: With its preening new bassline, it became their first US Top 40 hit since “Creep”. And on “House of Cards”, a song unabashedly about sex and all the places it could lead, the bandmates sound like a dubplate version of their former rock band selves, all lust-drunk and wobbling.\n\nRadiohead may have seemed newly at ease on <i>In Rainbows</i>, but making the record nearly broke the band. For the first time since <i>OK Computer</i>, the group members tried working with a producer other than Nigel Godrich—only to abandon the attempt, and instead take some tunes on the road. They eventually reunited with Godrich, who forced the bandmates—some of whom were new fathers—to focus on music, sequestering them in a broken-down country palace, and making them sort through all their fragments and false starts.\n\nThe effort yielded some of Radiohead’s most memorable songs, as though time and touring had taught the group to find this material’s essence. The impossible guitar tangle of “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi” finds a climax worthy of the best post-rock bands, as does the brief acoustic phantom, “Faust Arp”. Most stunning, though, might be the album’s finale, “Videotape”. Equal parts love note and goodbye letter, “Videotape” first arrived as a maximalist rush onstage at the Hammersmith Ballroom in 2006. But the band members kept peeling back layers and dropping parts in the studio, until all that remained were skeletal piano and rhythms that cracked apart and eventually floated skyward—as though Radiohead were drifting off into the void.",

In Rainbows was Radiohead's first release after the end of their contract with EMI and the end of the longest gap between studio albums in their career.\n\n\"In Rainbows\" was recorded in London, Somerset, Wiltshire, and Oxfordshire with producers Mark Stent and Nigel Godrich. Radiohead worked on the songs for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in 2006. Radiohead used a wide variety of musical styles on the album, incorporating string arrangements and electronic music, pianos, celestes and the ondes Martenot, yet renewing their focus on guitars, drums, and bass as lead instruments. The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than that of Radiohead's other work, with singer Thom Yorke describing it as his attempt to write \"seduction songs\".\n\n Upon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the United World Chart, UK Album Chart, and the U.S. Billboard 200 at number one. \"In Rainbows\" also earned widespread critical acclaim, and several publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2007. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/In+Rainbows\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
