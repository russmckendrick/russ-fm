      "biography": "Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English electronic music group formed in Wirral, Merseyside in 1978. Spawned by earlier band The Id, the outfit originally functioned as a duo composed of founding members Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), before other personnel were enlisted. As a group, OMD gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 single \"Enola Gay\", and achieved broader recognition via Architecture & Morality (1981) and its singles. Steadily resistant to \"pop star\" status, the band garnered acclaim for their experimental recordings, which were noted for their intellectual depth.\n\nAlthough retrospectively lauded, the challenging Dazzle Ships (1983) eroded European support during the mid 1980s; the group shifted toward more pop-oriented songwriting on Junk Culture (1984), while continuing to experiment with sounds via newly acquired digital samplers. Concurrently, the band reached their peak in the United States and had a major hit with 1986's \"If You Leave\", written for the film Pretty in Pink. Humphreys departed with the other members in 1989 to form The Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey to lead the outfit: Sugar Tax (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits in Europe. By the mid 1990s, however, synthpop had been supplanted by alternative rock, and McCluskey dissolved OMD in 1996.\n\nIn 2006 the group reformed with Humphreys back in the fold, and new material followed in 2009. Their European fanbase remained steadfast: History of Modern (2010) became the band's biggest hit on the German chart; English Electric (2013) their largest in the UK since Sugar Tax. The group have sold over 40 million records and have cultivated a legacy as innovators within popular music. An influence on many artists in diverse genres, OMD's songs have been covered, remixed and sampled by numerous chart acts, and the band are the subject of two tribute albums.",

            "content": "Organisation is the second studio album by English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), released on 24 October 1980 by Dindisc. On Organisation the group worked with a producer for the first time, enlisting former Gong bass player Mike Howlett, while session musician Malcolm Holmes became the band's full-time drummer. The record is noted for its dark, melancholic tone in comparison to previous OMD releases.\n\nOrganisation received generally favourable reviews and provided OMD with their first top-10 album in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart. \"Enola Gay\" was the only single taken from the record, and was the group's fourth entry on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number eight. Organisation was remastered and re-released in 2003, with several bonus tracks.\n\nOrganisation features a darker, more melancholic tone than OMD's previous work. The band had been Factory label-mates, and had played many gigs with Manchester group Joy Division, whose frontman Ian Curtis died by suicide during the writing of the album. OMD's compositions were influenced by Joy Division's moody sound, with \"Statues\" being inspired by Curtis himself. The record also drew from krautrock influences.\n\nOrganisation was produced by Mike Howlett, formerly bass player of Gong; this marked the first time the band had worked with a producer. Keyboardist Paul Humphreys said, \"We learned a lot from him. We were young and didn't understand the recording process and he guided us and pushed us – he was sensitive to our more esoteric, experimental side.\"Malcolm Holmes, who had drummed for precursor outfit the Id and provided session musicianship for OMD (notably on \"Julia's Song\", from the group's debut album), was recruited as a full-time band member, replacing the TEAC tape recorder named \"Winston\".\n\nSole single \"Enola Gay\" had little in common with the dark sound of the rest of the record, despite its bleak subject matter. The song was written at the same time as the band's debut album, as was \"Motion and Heart\", which was considered as a second single. \"The Misunderstanding\" is a holdover from the Id. \"The More I See You\" is a cover of a song written by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren in 1945, and popularised by Chris Montez in 1966. The track began as an original composition, but frontman Andy McCluskey found himself singing the words to \"The More I See You\" over the song, which morphed into a cover version. OMD's arrangement is radically different from that of previous versions.\n\n\"Promise\" features Humphreys' first lead vocal, as well as his first solo composition on an OMD album. \"Stanlow\" was written about the Stanlow Refinery in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, where McCluskey's father and sister worked. OMD cherished the view of the refinery lit up at night, often observing it when returning from tours. McCluskey's father granted the band access to the site to sample sounds from the machinery; a diesel pump forms the rhythmic opening of \"Stanlow\". \"VCL XI\" was the name of McCluskey and Humphreys' short lived group, which itself was named after a valve on the back of Kraftwerk's Radio-Activity album (the name of the valve is written \"VCL 11\" on the Radio-Activity sleeve). The record's title is a homage to the band Organisation, a precursor to Kraftwerk.\n\nAs with all of OMD's early album covers, the artwork was designed by Peter Saville Associates. It features a photograph by Richard Nutt of the cloud-covered peak of Marsco in the Red Cuillin hills, on the Isle of Skye. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Orchestral+Manoeuvres+in+the+Dark/Organisation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
