      "biography": "Pulp is a British band formed in Sheffield in 1978, fronted by lead singer and songwriter Jarvis Cocker. The group is known for their sharp, observational lyrics and a blend of pop, rock, and disco elements. They rose to fame in the mid-1990s as part of the Britpop movement, achieving significant success with their fifth album, His 'n' Hers (1994). However, it was their 1995 album, Different Class, that cemented their place in music history, featuring iconic tracks like \"Common People\" and \"Disco 2000.\" These songs offered witty and incisive commentaries on British life and class issues, resonating with a wide audience.\n\nFollowing Different Class, Pulp continued to explore darker and more introspective themes with albums like This Is Hardcore (1998) and We Love Life (2001). These later works demonstrated the band's versatility and depth, exploring complex emotional landscapes and societal critiques. Jarvis Cocker's charismatic presence and lyrical storytelling have been central to Pulp's enduring appeal, making them one of the most influential bands of their era. Their music continues to be celebrated for its intelligence, humor, and cultural relevance.",

            "content": "His 'n' Hers is the fourth studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 18 April 1994 by Island Records. It proved to be the band's breakthrough album, reaching number nine on the UK Albums Chart, and was nominated for the 1994 Mercury Music Prize. In 1998, Q magazine readers voted it the seventieth greatest album of all time, while it was placed at number 110 in the book Virgin All-Time Top 1000 Albums.\n\nLyrically, the album encompasses subjects for which Pulp were to become well known, including sexual encounters, social class and voyeurism. Robyn Strachan retrospectively describes the opener \"Joyriders\" as setting the tone for the album with \"acerbic observation and lurking seediness and decay\". \"She's a Lady\" takes much of its musical inspiration from Gloria Gaynor's \"I Will Survive\". The album closer, \"David's Last Summer\", is notable as being one of Pulp's most narrative songs, delivered entirely in spoken word apart from the chorus despite being an uptempo track.\n\nThe CD edition of the album included a new remixed version of the song “Babies”, the original version of which was previously released as a single in 1992. The album was preceded with two singles: \"Lipgloss\" and \"Do You Remember the First Time?\". The new mix of \"Babies\" was also released as a single as part of the Sisters EP. The album was a long-awaited breakthrough for Pulp in the UK becoming their first charting album reaching #9 and later certified Gold. A CD Deluxe edition of His 'n' Hers was released on 11 September 2006. It contained a second disc of B-sides, demos and rarities.
