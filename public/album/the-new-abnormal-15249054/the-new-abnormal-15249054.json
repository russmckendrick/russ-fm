      "biography": "The Strokes are an alternative rock band, known for their distinctive sound and cultural impact, particularly in the early 2000s.\n\nMembers\nJulian Casablancas (vocals), Nick Valensi (guitar), Albert Hammond Jr. (guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass), and Fabrizio Moretti (drums)\n\nFormation\nThe founding process of The Strokes was a serendipitous convergence of childhood connections and a shared musical vision. Julian Casablancas, Fabrizio Moretti, and Nick Valensi, childhood friends with varying musical experiences, came together in the late '90s. The trio's dynamic was enriched with the addition of guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. and bassist Nikolai Fraiture. Bonded by a mutual love for garage rock, punk, and new wave, the quintet officially formed The Strokes in 1998, embarking on a journey to synthesize their diverse influences into a sound that would later redefine the alternative rock landscape. The amalgamation of their individual talents and shared passion for music set the stage for The Strokes' rise to prominence in the early 2000s.\n\nIs This It (2001)\n\"Is This It\" The Strokes\" debut album released in 2001 under the reputable record label RCA, is an electrifying sonic manifesto that not only redefined the landscape of indie rock but also garnered widespread critical acclaim. Infused with a raw and unfiltered energy, the album became an instant classic, hailed for its gritty exploration of New York City's underground music scene. Featuring iconic tracks like \"Last Nite\" and \"Someday,\" Julian Casablancas' charismatic vocals, Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr.'s guitar interplay, and the band's overall swagger made \"Is This It\" a timeless masterpiece. Its critical acclaim propelled The Strokes to the forefront of the early 2000s indie rock revival, cementing their status as trailblazers in the genre.\n\nRoom On Fire (2003)\n\"Room On Fire\" the sophomore album by The Strokes released in 2003, seamlessly follows the success of their groundbreaking debut, \"Is This It\" The Strokes\" (2001). While \"Is This It\" The Strokes\" quickly became a cultural touchstone and achieved widespread acclaim, \"Room On Fire\" faced the challenge of living up to its predecessor's legacy.\nFrom the rhythmic urgency of \"12:51\" to the infectious guitar riffs of \"Reptilia,\" each track on \"Room On Fire\" showcases The Strokes' continued commitment to crafting catchy, yet substantive, rock anthems. While not eclipsing the commercial success of their debut, the album solidified The Strokes' standing as stalwarts of the early 2000s rock revival, demonstrating their artistic growth and ability to sustain their unique sound.\n\n Juicebox and First Impressions Of Earth (2005 - 2006)\n\"Juicebox\" by The Strokes, released as a single on November 14, 2005, ahead of their album \"First Impressions of Earth,\" faced an early online leak, adding to the anticipation. Despite this, the track's bold guitar riffs and Julian Casablancas' charismatic vocals contributed to its positive reception, marking a significant moment in The Strokes' musical journey. They also released a catchy B-side \"Hawaii\".\n\n\"First Impressions Of Earth\" The Strokes' third studio album released in January 2006, received a mix of reviews. Critics praised the album's experimental departure from the band's earlier sound, commending Julian Casablancas' introspective lyrics, dynamic guitar work, and rhythmic innovation. Standout tracks like \"Juicebox\" and \"You Only Live Once\" showcased The Strokes' ability to evolve while retaining their signature coolness. Despite differing opinions, the album marked a bold exploration of new musical territories and sparked conversations about the band's artistic evolution within the indie rock landscape.\n\nAngles (2011)\n\"Angles\" released by The Strokes in 2011, is a pivotal album in the band's journey, receiving a mix of reviews. Critics lauded its experimentation and collaborative nature, showcasing a departure from their previous works. Standout tracks like \"Under Cover of Darkness\" and \"Machu Picchu\" received praise for blending The Strokes' signature sound with fresh influences. While some critics found the album's diversity refreshing, others felt it lacked cohesion. Despite mixed reviews, \"Angles\" signaled The Strokes' return with a revitalized energy, sparking conversations about their evolving musical direction.\n\nComedown Machine (2013)\n\"Comedown Machine\" released by The Strokes in 2013, is a unique entry in their discography. The album showcases a departure from their traditional sound, embracing a more synth-driven and experimental approach. Tracks like \"One Way Trigger\" and \"Tap Out\" demonstrate The Strokes' willingness to evolve, dividing critics but still affirming their capacity for sonic exploration. \"Comedown Machine\" adds another layer to The Strokes' musical evolution, inviting listeners into a realm of unexpected sounds and creative divergence. The Strokes adopted a media blackout strategy, refraining from interviews and traditional promotional activities. This intentional approach added an air of mystery to the album's release, sparking curiosity and discussions about the band's creative intentions.\n\nFuture Present Past EP (2016)\n\"Future Present Past\" is a 2016 EP by The Strokes, featuring tracks like \"Drag Queen\", \"OBLIVIOUS\" and \"Threat Of Joy\" offering a glimpse into the band's evolving sound during the period between their albums \"Comedown Machine\" and \"The New Abnormal\".\n\nThe New Abnormal (2020)\nProduced by legendary music producer Rick Rubin, \"The New Abnormal\" is The Strokes' sixth studio album, released in 2020 after a seven-year hiatus. The album represents a return to the spotlight for the band and showcases a blend of their signature rock sound with fresh and contemporary elements. Notable tracks include \"The Adults Are Talking\" and \"Selfless\". \"The New Abnormal\" received critical acclaim for its maturity, experimentation, and the band's ability to evolve while staying true to their distinctive style. The album's release was a highly anticipated moment for fans, marking a successful comeback for The Strokes after their extended hiatus.\n\nAlbert Hammond Jr. confirmed, that The Strokes are working on a new album, a follow-up to the succesful \"The New Abnormal\".\n\nHere are the band members' side projects along with their released albums:\n\nJulian Casablancas: \nJulian Casablancas - Phrazes For The Young (2009).The Voidz - Tyranny (2014), Virtue (2018), Like All Before You (2024).\n\nAlbert Hammond Jr.\nAlbert Hammond Jr. - Yours To Keep (2006), Como Te Llama?

For their sixth LP, The Strokes turn to the Mage of Malibu to produce their most focused collection of songs since 2003’s <i>Room on Fire</i>—the very beginning of a period marked by discord, disinterest and addiction. Only their fourth record since, <i>The New Abnormal</i> finds the fivesome sounding fully engaged and totally revitalised, offering glimpses of themselves as we first came to know them at the turn of the millennium—young saviours of rock, if not its last true stars—while also providing the sort of perspective and even grace that comes with age. “Bad Decisions” is at turns riffy and elegiac, Julian Casablancas’ corkscrewing chorus melody a close enough relative to 1981’s “Dancing With Myself” that Billy Idol and Tony James are credited as songwriters. Though not as immediate, “Not the Same Anymore” is equally toothsome, a heart-stopping soul number that manages to capture feelings of both triumph and deep regret, with Casablancas opening himself up and delivering what might be his finest vocal performance to date. “I was afraid,” he sings, amid a weave of cresting guitars. “I fucked up/I couldn’t change/It’s too late.” For a band that forged an entire mythology around appearing as though they couldn’t be bothered, this is an exciting development. It’s cool to care, too.",

Though not as immediate, “Not the Same Anymore” is equally toothsome, a heart-stopping soul number that manages to capture feelings of both triumph and deep regret, with Casablancas opening himself up and delivering what might be his finest vocal performance to date. “I was afraid,” he sings, amid a weave of cresting guitars. “I fucked up/I couldn’t change/It’s too late.” For a band that forged an entire mythology around appearing as though they couldn’t be bothered, this is an exciting development. It’s cool to care, too."

            "content": "\"The New Abnormal\" is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Strokes. It was released on April 10, 2020, through Cult and RCA Records. It comes nearly seven years after March 2013’s Comedown Machine, although the band had reunited briefly to release a three-track EP titled \"Future Present Past\" in June 2016.\n\nThe album title \"The New Abnormal\" is a reference to the present age of environmental disaster. “There were these huge fires in Los Angeles,” Julian  about their time recording. “A lot of houses burned down but Shangri-La  survived, by some miracle. That’s where the name of the album comes from, the extreme weather, the violence…”\n\nRumors of the album’s production began in July 2017, when Albert Hammond—father of The Strokes’ guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr.—mentioned that the band was in-studio with producer Rick Rubin in an interview with The West Australian. This rumor was quickly dispelled by Hammond Jr. in a since-deleted tweet, claiming: “Forgive Albert Sr he got prematurely excited. A lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time.” He did concede, however, that “We met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe, but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all.” Damage control continued with Julian joking on Twitter, saying:\n\n\"(What Albert Sr meant to say is we are working with NBA point guard Ricky Rubio on a new offense for our basketball league)\"\n\nBack in December 2018, the band announced a series of tour dates and a “global comeback” for 2019. The first event took place at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on May 13, where they performed a new song, titled “The Adults Are Talking.” The last concert of 2019 took place on New Year’s Eve at the Barclays Center in their hometown of Brooklyn, New York. They performed a new song titled “Ode to the Mets.” Julian Casablancas then confirmed:\n\n\"Yeah, we’ve got a new album coming out soon. 2020, here we come. The 2010s, whatever the fuck they’re called, we took ‘em off. And now we’ve been unfrozen and we’re back. If you really love someone, you’ll be frozen with them. You know what? I don’t know what I say generally, and I ramble a lot, but I lo\"ve you guys, and it’s a real honor to share the stage and this night with you guys.\n\n- via Rolling Stone (January 2020)\n\nNews around the album’s actual release began on February 7, 2020, when Albert Hammond Jr. tweeted: “You think you’ve been waiting. But the wait has just begun. Welcome to the new abnormal.” Similar videos and promotions began appearing on the band members’ social media pages and billboards around the world. Leaked ASCAP listings for “songs written by Julian Casablancas” also revealed the tracklist and various co-writers on the album, including pop-rock icon Billy Idol.\n\nA few days later on February 10, 2020, the band played a live political rally in support of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A short musical snippet of “At the Door” played before the concert, foretelling of the song’s official release the next day, along with the music video and the upcoming album’s tracklist and album art. The band also performed a new song titled “Bad Decisions,” which was released the following Tuesday, February 18, 2020, along with its accompanying music video. According to Albert Hammond Jr.’s Twitter, this would be the first official single for the new record.\n\nOn April 6, 2020, the band released “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus” as the final single preceding the album’s release.\n\nThe New Abnormal debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200 during the chart week of April 26, 2020 after selling approximately 35,000 album-equivalent units during its first week.\n\nOn March 14, 2021, The Strokes won their first-ever Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of the Year at the 63rd Grammy Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/The+New+Abnormal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "\"The New Abnormal\" is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Strokes. It was released on April 10, 2020, through Cult and RCA Records. It comes nearly seven years after March 2013’s Comedown Machine, although the band had reunited briefly to release a three-track EP titled \"Future Present Past\" in June 2016.\n\nThe album title \"The New Abnormal\" is a reference to the present age of environmental disaster. “There were these huge fires in Los Angeles,” Julian  about their time recording. “A lot of houses burned down but Shangri-La  survived, by some miracle. That’s where the name of the album comes from, the extreme weather, the violence…”\n\nRumors of the album’s production began in July 2017, when Albert Hammond—father of The Strokes’ guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr.—mentioned that the band was in-studio with producer Rick Rubin in an interview with The West Australian. This rumor was quickly dispelled by Hammond Jr. in a since-deleted tweet, claiming: “Forgive Albert Sr he got prematurely excited. A lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time.” He did concede, however, that “We met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe, but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all.” Damage control continued with Julian joking on Twitter, saying:\n\n\"(What Albert Sr meant to say is we are working with NBA point guard Ricky Rubio on a new offense for our basketball league)\"\n\nBack in December 2018, the band announced a series of tour dates and a “global comeback” for 2019. The first event took place at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on May 13, where they performed a new song, titled “The Adults Are Talking.” The last concert of 2019 took place on New Year’s Eve at the Barclays Center in their hometown of Brooklyn, New York. They performed a new song titled “Ode to the Mets.” Julian Casablancas then confirmed:\n\n\"Yeah, we’ve got a new album coming out soon. 2020, here we come. The 2010s, whatever the fuck they’re called, we took ‘em off. And now we’ve been unfrozen and we’re back. If you really love someone, you’ll be frozen with them. You know what? I don’t know what I say generally, and I ramble a lot, but I lo\"ve you guys, and it’s a real honor to share the stage and this night with you guys.\n\n- via Rolling Stone (January 2020)\n\nNews around the album’s actual release began on February 7, 2020, when Albert Hammond Jr. tweeted: “You think you’ve been waiting. But the wait has just begun. Welcome to the new abnormal.” Similar videos and promotions began appearing on the band members’ social media pages and billboards around the world. Leaked ASCAP listings for “songs written by Julian Casablancas” also revealed the tracklist and various co-writers on the album, including pop-rock icon Billy Idol.\n\nA few days later on February 10, 2020, the band played a live political rally in support of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A short musical snippet of “At the Door” played before the concert, foretelling of the song’s official release the next day, along with the music video and the upcoming album’s tracklist and album art. The band also performed a new song titled “Bad Decisions,” which was released the following Tuesday, February 18, 2020, along with its accompanying music video. According to Albert Hammond Jr.’s Twitter, this would be the first official single for the new record.\n\nOn April 6, 2020, the band released “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus” as the final single preceding the album’s release.\n\nThe New Abnormal debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200 during the chart week of April 26, 2020 after selling approximately 35,000 album-equivalent units during its first week.\n\nOn March 14, 2021, The Strokes won their first-ever Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of the Year at the 63rd Grammy Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/The+New+Abnormal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
