      "biography": "Pink Floyd were an English rock band that achieved international success with their progressive and psychedelic rock music marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, and elaborate live shows. One of the most commercially successful and influential rock groups in the history of popular music, they have sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States. They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.\nThe band originally consisted of university students Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright, and Syd Barrett. Founded in 1965, they gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s. Under Barrett's creative leadership they released two charting singles, \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play\", and a successful début album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967, several months prior to Barrett's April 1968 departure due to deteriorating mental health. With the loss of Syd, the band moved from psychedelic pop to a more progressive sound, with many tracks written collaboratively while on tour. With this line-up they achieved critical and commercial success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). With Animals and The Wall, Waters became the primary songwriter.\nWright was forced by Waters to leave the group in 1979. Following The Final Cut (1983), the group was temporarily disbanded by Waters. Gilmour and Mason reformed in 1985, and were subsequently rejoined by Wright. They continued to record and tour through 1994, despite Waters' failed 1986 attempt to legally prevent them continuing as Pink Floyd; two more albums followed, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994). After almost two decades of acrimony the band reunited in 2005 for a single performance, at the global awareness event Live 8. Wright died in 2008. Surviving members Gilmour and Mason joined Waters at one of his The Wall Tour shows on 12 May 2011 at the O2 Arena in London; Gilmour performed \"Comfortably Numb\" along with Waters and \"Outside the Wall\" with Mason and Waters.",

            "content": "Ummagumma is a double album by Pink Floyd, released in 1969 by Harvest and EMI  in the United Kingdom and Harvest and Capitol in the United States. Side A is a live album of their normal set list of the time, while side B contains individual compositions by each member of the band recorded as a studio album.\n\nThe album's title supposedly comes from a Cambridge  slang word for sex, commonly used by one of Pink Floyd's friends and occasional roadie, Ian \"Emo\" Moore, who would say 'I'm going back to the house for some Ummagumma'. However, some band members have since stated that the word was \"totally made up and means nothing at all\". In footage of the band rehearsing for a Royal Albert Hall appearance in 1969, one of the band members can be heard, off camera, quietly chanting the word \"ummagumma\".\n\nAlthough the sleeve notes say that the live material was recorded in June 1969, the first disc of Ummagumma was recorded live at Mothers Club, Birmingham, on 27 April 1969 and the following week at Manchester College of Commerce, on 2 May 1969; the second disc included four solo segments, one half-side of vinyl each by, in order: Richard Wright, Roger Waters, David Gilmour, and Nick Mason.\n\nThe band had also recorded a live version of \"Interstellar Overdrive\" (from The Piper at the Gates of Dawn), intended for placement on side one of the live album. The track was dropped at the last minute, some say to maintain the sound fidelity of the record, but numerous test pressings with the original track list were given to friends of the band, including John Peel. Other sources have claimed that the song was dropped because of a conflict over the music publishing rights. (It would have been one of only two songs on the record to include Syd Barrett as a writer.)\n\nThe cover shows the members of the band, with a picture hanging on the wall showing the same scene, except the band members have switched positions. The picture on the wall also includes the picture on the wall, creating a recursion effect, with each recursion showing band members exchanging positions. After 4 variations of the scene, the final picture within picture is the cover of the previous Pink Floyd album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The latter, however, is absent from the CD release; instead, the recursion effect is seemingly ad infinitum.\n\nThe cover of the original LP varies between the British, American/Canadian, and Australian releases. The British version has the album Gigi leaning against the wall immediately above the \"Pink Floyd\" letters. At a talk given at Borders bookstore in Cambridge on 1 November 2008, as part of the \"City Wakes\" project , Storm Thorgerson explained that the album was introduced as a red herring to provoke debate, and that it has no intended meaning. On most copies of American and Canadian editions, the Gigi cover is airbrushed to a plain white sleeve, apparently because of copyright concerns; however the earliest American copies do show the Gigi cover, and it was restored for the American CD edition. On the Australian edition, the Gigi cover is completely airbrushed, not even leaving a white square behind. The house used as the location for the front cover of the album is located in Great Shelford, near Cambridge.\n\nOn the rear cover, roadies Alan Stiles and Peter Watts are shown with the band's equipment laid out on a runway at Biggin Hill Airport; a concept proposed by Nick Mason, with the intention of replicating the \"exploded\" drawings of military aircraft and their payloads, which were popular at the time.\n\nSong titles on the back are laid out slightly differently in British vs. North American editions; the most important difference being the inclusion of sub-titles for the four sections of \"A Saucerful of Secrets\". These subtitles only appeared on American and Canadian editions of this album, but not on the British edition; nor did they appear on original pressings of A Saucerful of Secrets.\n\nThe inner gatefold art shows separate black and white photos of the band members. David Gilmour is seen standing in front of the Elfin Oak. Original vinyl editions showed Waters with his first wife, Jude, but she has been cropped out of the picture on most CD editions. The uncropped picture was restored for the album's inclusion in the box set, Oh, by the Way.\n\nThe album was released in the United Kingdom on 25 October 1969 and then in the US on 10 November 1969. The album reached number five on the UK album charts and number 74 on the US album charts, marking the first time the band reached the top 100 in the US. The album was certified Gold in the US in February 1974 and Platinum in March 1994. In 1987, the album was re-released on a two CD set. A digitally re-mastered version was released in 1994 in the UK and 1995 in the US.\n\nThe CD edition includes a longer version of \"Sysyphus\"—extended to 13:26, with the movements lasting 1:08, 3:30, 1:49, and 6:59. The original \"Part 1\" of \"Sysyphus\" was split into two tracks and called \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\". \"Part 2\" on vinyl became \"Part 3\" on CD, and \"Part 3\" and \"Part 4\" were combined into the CD's \"Part 4\" (the original \"Part 4\" begins with the lengthy orchestral thud.) \"The Narrow Way\" and \"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\" were also split into their three parts for easier navigation.\n\n# In the \"Weird Al\" Yankovic mockumentary, The Compleat Al, Al is trying to describe the synchronicities between famous rock albums and \"ancient astronauts\". He holds up an Ummagumma LP and jokingly says, \"Remember this? Well, I did a little research and found out that \"Ummagumma\" is actually an ancient word for: 'We're running out of ideas for songs, help us.'\"\n# MFSL announced their plans to release Ummagumma on their ultrasound series, but later withdrew those stating that the master tapes were below quality.\n# After Pink Floyd's 16 May 1970 performance at The Warehouse in New Orleans, the equipment shown on the rear cover of Ummagumma was stolen. The remaining concerts on this US tour were cancelled. After the theft, and the Grateful Dead's drug bust after their 31 January 1970 performance, also at The Warehouse; New Orleans was shunned by most rock bands for the first half of the 1970s. The Grateful Dead would not play in New Orleans for another 10 years. Pink Floyd wouldn't play there for another 24 years.\n# The original intention of the band with the live album was to release those songs and then stop playing them. However, with the popularity of the album, the public kept wanting to hear songs from the live album, and so they stayed in their set lists for some time.\n# Part 3 of \"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\" is among the shortest Pink Floyd studio recordings ever released. Only \"Stop\", which was 0:30, from The Wall, and \"A New Machine (Part 2)\", which was 0:38, from A Momentary Lapse of Reason, are of equal or shorter length.\n# This album, More, Atom Heart Mother, and Obscured by Clouds were the only Floyd studio albums to not be represented on Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd\n# The sequencing of the studio album later inspired the arrangement for the Minutemen double album Double Nickels on the Dime.\n\n\"What was your inspiration for The Narrow Way (on Ummagumma) your first major Floyd composition?\"\n\n    \"Well, we'd decided to make the damn album, and each of us to do a piece of music on our own... it was just desperation really, trying to think of something to do, to write by myself. I'd never written anything before, I just went into a studio and started waffling about, tacking bits and pieces together. I haven't heard it in years. I've no idea what it's like.\" - David Gilmour - Sounds \"Guitar Heroes\" Magazine, May 1983\n\n\"What do you think of your early records like Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma today?\"\n\n    \"I think both are pretty horrible. Well, the live disc of Ummagumma might be all right, but even that isn't recorded well.\" - David Gilmour — Der Spiegel No. 23 - 5 June 1995\n\n\"When you listen to Ummagumma, you get the feeling that each one of you is doing his own music, not caring much about the others.\"\n\n    \"That's right. I can't be precise, but we were very individualistic at the time.\" - Nick Mason — March 1973\n\n\"The back of Ummagumma comes from something Nick Mason did\". - Storm Thorgerson - Guitar World - February 1998 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Ummagumma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I'd never written anything before, I just went into a studio and started waffling about, tacking bits and pieces together. I haven't heard it in years. I've no idea what it's like.\" - David Gilmour - Sounds \"Guitar Heroes\" Magazine, May 1983\n\n\"What do you think of your early records like Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma today?\"\n\n    \"I think both are pretty horrible. Well, the live disc of Ummagumma might be all right, but even that isn't recorded well.\" - David Gilmour — Der Spiegel No. 23 - 5 June 1995\n\n\"When you listen to Ummagumma, you get the feeling that each one of you is doing his own music, not caring much about the others.\"\n\n    \"That's right. I can't be precise, but we were very individualistic at the time.\" - Nick Mason — March 1973\n\n\"The back of Ummagumma comes from something Nick Mason did\". - Storm Thorgerson - Guitar World - February 1998 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Ummagumma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_summary": "Ummagumma is a double album by Pink Floyd, released in 1969 by Harvest and EMI in the United Kingdom and Harvest and Capitol in the United States. Side A is a live album of their normal set list of the time, while side B contains individual compositions by each member of the band recorded as a studio album. The album's title supposedly comes from a Cambridge slang word for sex, commonly used by one of Pink Floyd's friends and occasional roadie, Ian \"Emo\" Moore, who would say 'I'm going back to the house for some Ummagumma'.
