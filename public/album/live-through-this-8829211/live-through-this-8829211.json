      "biography": "Hole is an American alternative rock band that originally formed in Los Angeles in 1989. The band is fronted by singer-songwriter Courtney Love (vocals, rhythm guitar), who co-founded Hole with Eric Erlandson (lead guitar). Hole achieved considerable commercial and critical success throughout the 1990s, initially releasing singles through independent labels in L.A. and debuting with their caustic noise rock-influenced Pretty on the Inside (1991), and later gaining near-unanimous critical acclaim with their 1994 album Live Through This.\nAs the band progressed into the later 1990s, they incorporated elements of power pop into their sound. The band's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), fused hard rock with various pop elements, contrasting to their previous styles. Celebrity Skin went on to be the band's most commercially successful album, garnering them immense critical attention as well as several Grammy nominations.\nThe group officially disbanded in 2002 and its members began solo careers and other projects. In 2009, Love announced she was reforming Hole as the sole returning member. Erlandson, however, stated that no reunion could take place contractually without mutual involvement between Love and Erlandson. On January 1, 2010, a website promoting Hole's latest release, Nobody's Daughter, was launched, with links to various social media pages including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and MySpace.\nDespite the dispute between Erlandson and Love, the new Hole album was released in April 2010 and the band toured Europe and North America in support of the record.",

The legendary late Nirvana leader was said to have contributed background vocals on at least two tracks, and was often credited with ghostwriting at least some of the songs for his then-wife. Still, much of that unproven and widely debunked gossip seems to speak more to the widespread sexism that still persisted at the time—even in alternative culture—as well as a more specific ill will toward Love as an artist and divisive public figure.\n\nWhat’s impossible to deny is the raw power of <i>Live</i>’s electrifying blasts of noise and fury, beginning with the ferocious churn of “Violet”, with its excoriating chorus, “Go on, take everything/Take everything, I want you to.” (Despite many fans’ assumptions, Love hinted more than once that its unpretty inspiration came from her contentious relationship with The Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan, not Cobain). The 12 tracks here, knocked out over several weeks at the same Georgia studio where <i>Siamese Dream</i> was recorded, is littered with lyrics that seem designed to be carved into skin with a pocketknife: “Was she asking for it?/Was she asking nice?/Yeah, she was asking for it/Did she ask you twice?” (from “Asking For It”) and “I fake it so real, I am beyond fake” (“Doll Parts”).\n\nCobain’s passing was hardly the only devastating loss to shadow the record, as bassist Kristen Pfaff would be dead of a heroin overdose within two months of <i>Live Through This</i>’ release. Though it was her only full album with the band, those contributions played an undeniable role in Hole’s dramatic evolution from the deliberately lo-fi scrape and fuzz of their 1991 debut, <i>Pretty On the Inside</i>. The result remains a career-defining near-masterpiece, and a towering document of the era—a deathless collection of monster hooks and lacerating melodies written in lightning.",

            "content": "Live Through This is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Hole, released on April 12, 1994, by DGC Records. Recorded in late 1993, it departed from the band's unpolished hardcore aesthetics to more refined melodies and song structure.\n\nFrontwoman Courtney Love said that she wanted the record to be \"shocking to the people who think that we don't have a soft edge\", but maintain a harsh sensibility. The album was produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie and mixed by Scott Litt and J Mascis. The lyrics and packaging reflect Love's thematic preoccupations with beauty, and motifs of milk, motherhood, anti-elitism, and violence against women, while Love derived the album title from a quote in Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nAt the time of its release, the album was met with critical acclaim, and it earned top-100 chart spots in seven countries before going multi-platinum in December 1994. Despite this, it was also the subject of some public discussion regarding unsubstantiated rumors  that Love's husband, Kurt Cobain —who died by suicide one week before the album's release — helped ghostwrite the album. This claim has been disputed by the band members, producers, as well as music biographers, though the band confirmed that Cobain sang additional backing vocals on two tracks during a visit to the studio.\n\nIn critical circles, Live Through This is considered a contemporary classic, and was included in Rolling Stone's 2020 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 460, as well as being featured on the list 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album was also named the 84th greatest album of all time in a list produced by NME in 2013.
