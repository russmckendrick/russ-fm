  "biography": "Dream The Electric Sleep are a progressive, concept-rock band from Lexington, KY. Although primarily rooted in progressive rock, the band employs elements of shoegaze, classical, folk, doom, psychedelic and pop. \n\nFormed in 2009, guitarist/vocalist Matt Page and drummer Joey Waters recruited bassist Chris Tackett formerly of Chum (Century Media) and Hyatari (Codebreaker/Earache). The trio spent the following two years developing an uncommon sound characterized by an eclectic blend of influences. \n\nThe result was the band's self-produced debut concept LP, Lost and Gone Forever. \n\nLost and Gone Forever received international critical acclaim, gaining a wide variety of print and online reviews (including Classic Rock Magazine, Eclipsed Magazine, The Big Takeover, Progression Magazine, among many others), and was an underground favorite amongst many in the progressive rock and crossover/heavy rock communities. As a result, the band was asked to perform at one of the premier progressive rock festivals in the United States, the Rites of Spring Festival (RoSfest), and were given the coveted “Church of Prog” slot. \n\nThe band returned from RoSfest in May 2013 to finish producing their sophomore LP, entitled Heretics. \n\nReleased in February, 2014, Heretics features 11 tracks and over 70 minutes of revolutionary progressive post-rock that one reviewer described as possibly “the greatest album in the Post-Prog genre to date.\" The album received an overwhelmingly positive response from critics and fans alike, and established Dream the Electric Sleep as one of the more powerful forces in the modern progressive rock genre. \n\nHeretics has since landed on numerous 2014 Top Album critics lists, and continues to gain world-wide momentum.\n\n2014 also marked another significant live performance for the band at Germany's prestigious Night of the Prog Festival - alongside Prog giants Anathema, Transatlantic, IQ, and Marillion. The band's distinctly heavy approach to progressive rock was a fan favorite of the festival, and confirmed to European audiences the band's compelling live presence. \n\nDream the Electric Sleep will enter the studio in May 2105 to record the full-length follow-up to Heretics.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dream+the+Electric+Sleep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
