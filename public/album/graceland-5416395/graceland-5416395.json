Simon wrote most of the pair's songs, including three that reached No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". The duo split up in 1970 at the height of their popularity, and Simon began a successful solo career, recording three highly acclaimed albums over the next five years. In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music. Simon also wrote and starred in the film One-Trick Pony (1980) and co-wrote the Broadway musical The Capeman (1998).",

      "editorial_notes": "By the mid-1980s, Paul Simon was full of uncertainty. His 1983 album <i>Hearts and Bones</i> had underperformed, and Simon, now in his forties, worried he was too old for the newly ascendent MTV. It was around this time that Heidi Berg, a songwriter that Simon worked with at New York’s Brill Building, played him a copy of <i>Gumboots Accordion Jive Hits Volume II</i>, a collection of instrumental South African accordion music. To Simon, the songs were hard-driving, hopeful and optimistic. “It all seemed familiar to me,” he later told biographer Robert Hilburn. “[The music] had a feeling that was something like 1950s rock ’n’ roll. But the guitar lines were different from American lines.”\n\nSimon tracked down the South African musicians from that tape, the Boyoyo Boys, and met the group in Johannesburg, South Africa. He also invited a team of local pros—including bassist Bakithi Kumalo, guitarist Chikapa “Ray” Phiri and drummer Isaac Mtshali—to improvise for days. Accordionist Forere Motloheloa said he had reservations: “I continued to ask myself, ‘Who is going to want to hear this township music in America?’”\n\nSimon returned to the US to craft those instrumentals into songs. He took one of Motloheloa’s rowdy accordion melodies and wrote “The Boy in the Bubble”, combining images of apartheid South Africa with snapshot images of frivolous American culture. He transformed the Boyoyo Boys’ wildly fun groove “Gumboots” into a blissful plea for love. And he combined his childhood love of doo-wop with the sounds of the South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo on the tracks “Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes” and “Homeless”. But one especially challenging track required Simon to hit the road. While listening back to a minor progression played by guitarist Phiri, the singer began thinking of Elvis Presley’s Memphis home. So Simon rented a car and drove to Graceland for the first time. On the way, the lyrics came to him: “The Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar/I am following the river down the highway through the cradle of the Civil War.” As Simon later recalled: “Eventually, I understood that the song is about why we are travelling to Graceland—to find out how to get healed—and that’s why I named the album <i>Graceland</i>.”\n\nReleased in 1986, <i>Graceland</i> would become the most successful solo album of Simon’s career: a culture-conquering smash that arrived (and thrived) at the dawn of the CD era. The album was also highly controversial, with some detractors accusing Simon of endorsing the oppressive South African government with the project, and others accusing him of exploiting his guest musicians (Simon pushed back, saying he paid artists triple-scale and also offered writing credits). Despite the pushback, <i>Graceland</i> won rave reviews, four Grammys and sold more than 16 million copies. “There were people who said I shouldn't go,” Simon said at the time of the album's release. “South Africa is a supercharged subject surrounded with a tremendous emotional velocity. I knew I would be criticised if I went…I was following my musical instincts in wanting to work with people whose music I greatly admired.”",

            "content": "Graceland is an album released by Paul Simon in 1986. It was a hit in the UK topping the charts at #1. It also reached #3 in the US. The album won the Album of the Year Grammy award, while the title song won the Record of the Year Grammy award, for 1986 and 1987 respectively. In 2006, the album was added to the United States National Recording Registry, along with another 24 significant recordings that year.\n\nComing at a time when Simon's musical career was at something of a low ebb following the disappointing public response to Hearts and Bones, the project was originally inspired by Simon's listening to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys instrumental \"Gumboots\", lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer-songwriter with whom Simon was working (and who would later become an award-winning jingle singer and writer). Simon later wrote lyrics to sing over a re-recording of the song, which became the fourth track on the album.\n\nThe group Los Lobos appear on the last track, \"All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints.\" According to Los Lobos's saxophone player Steve Berlin, Simon stole the song from Los Lobos, giving them no songwriting credit:\n\n    \"It was not a pleasant deal for us. I mean he  quite literally — and in no way do I exaggerate when I say — he stole the songs from us... We go into the studio, and he had quite literally nothing. I mean, he had no ideas, no concepts, and said, \"Well, let's just jam.\" ...Paul goes, \"Hey, what's that?\" We start playing what we have of it, and it is exactly what you hear on the record. So we're like, \"Oh, ok. We'll share this song.\" ...A few months later, the record comes out and says \"Words and Music by Paul Simon.\" We were like, \"What the fuck is this?\" We tried calling him, and we can't find him. Weeks go by and our managers can't find him. We finally track him down and ask him about our song, and he goes, \"Sue me. See what happens.\"\n\nPaul Simon answered: \"I just said at this stage I don't care whether the album comes out without Los Lobos on it. I was getting really tired of it—I don't want to get into a public slanging match over this, but this thing keeps coming up. So we finished the recordings. And three months passed, and there was no mention of 'joint writing.' The album came out and we heard nothing. Then six months passed and Graceland had become a hit and the first thing I heard about the problem was when my manager got a lawyer's letter. I was shocked. They sent this thing to my manager, not me. If there was a problem, they could have contacted me direct. They've got my home number; we talked a lot. If you ask me, it was a lawyer's idea. You know, 'The record's a hit, and there's $100,000 in it.' They had nine months from the recordings to talk to me about all this, but I heard nothing. And it's still not sorted out, because they still keep bringing it up—I heard they'd done this interview for you. I don't want to get into a public slanging match with them, because I really like their music.\"\n\nGraceland was Paul Simon's highest charting album in the U.S. in over a decade, reaching #3 in the national Billboard charts, receiving a certification of 5× Platinum by the RIAA and eventually selling over 14 million copies, making it the singer's most commercially successful album. Critics welcomed its eclectic mix of sounds and broad, quirky subject matter and it regularly shows up in critic polls and \"recommended\" lists. The album also helped to draw worldwide attention to the music of South Africa.\n\nIn the Graceland Classic Albums video, Simon states that he considers the title track the best song he has ever written. A popular music video starring Simon and Chevy Chase was made for the hit song \"You Can Call Me Al\". Simon toured the album extensively, featuring many of the artists from the album in addition to exiled South Africans Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba. Two concerts in Harare, Zimbabwe, were filmed in 1987 for release as \"The African Concert\". The audience was a multi-racial mix with many travelling from South Africa.\n\nRankings:\n\n    * Voted the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll.\n    * In 1998, Q magazine readers voted it the 56th greatest album of all time.\n    * It was also ranked #84 in a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.\n    * In 1989, it was rated #5 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the '80s.\n    * It is #81 on the list of Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n    * The song \"Graceland\" was voted #485 in the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n    * According to AcclaimedMusic.net, a site which combines hundreds of best-of lists from critics and musicians from around the world, Graceland is ranked at #66 on the greatest albums of all time.
