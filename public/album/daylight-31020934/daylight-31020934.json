      "biography": "David McAlmont is most famous as part of the duo McAlmont and Butler who's hit 'Yes' reached the UK top 10.  David's career in music pre-dated this hit by a number of years.  First he was part of the 'indie' band 'Thieves' another duo consisting of McAlmont and Saul Freeman.  They were touted by NME as an important new emerging act particularly because of the amazing voice of McAlmont and his flamboyant extravagant behaviour and appearance.  David and Saul released the single 'Unworthy' during 1993 but then subsequently fell out during the completion of the debut album.  David was continued to be signed as a solo artist and the album was released as 'McAlmont'.  The album spawned a further single 'Either' in 1995.  The album did not sell well although it did raise David's profile mainly in the 'indie' music press.  The album is an ambient wash of delicate melodies, dreamy guitar and David's falsetto voice.  It contains an interesting cover of a Joni Mitchell song 'Conversation' - an artist whom McAlmont has acknowledged as a major influence.\n\nSuede were a very notorious band during the early 90's particularly during their first eponymous album.  The signature sound of Suede was thanks to the guitar work of Bernard Butler.  Bernard fell out with the band members and the producer of the first two Suede albums.  He walked away from the band and later hooked up with David McAlmont.  Initially they were only going to 'try out' in the studio.  The session produced a number of songs which became part of the 'Yes EPs'.  'Yes' became a huge hit and the press heralded the emergence of a new talent.  The follow up single 'You Do' also made the top 10 in the UK.  However, history repeats and yet again David and Bernard fell out and the partnership was dissolved.  One album was released which was a collection from the EPs previously released as well as one additional song.  The album was imaginatively called 'The Sound of McAlmont and Butler'.\n\nDavid then spent a long time trying to create his follow up album.  It would be an important album to see if he could, as a solo artist continue the commercial and critical success experienced with McAlmont and Butler.  He first released a single from called 'Look at Yourself' which sounded as if he were trying to copy the McAlmont and Butler blueprint.  Although it garnered lots of radio play the single barely scraped into the Top 40.  David scrapped the rest of the work that had been carried out in the same vein and began the process of writing a new album from scratch.  His efforts were rewarded with 'A Little Communication' which was his first release under his full name of David McAlmont.  The sound was a sea change from his previous work - it was a classy, sophisticated soul effort - emphasising the quality of David's primary asset - his voice.  Three singles were released from the record - 'Honey', 'A Little Communication' and 'Lose My Faith' while the last two single particularly were geared to commercial success none sold well.\n\nAgain David retreated to make another album and another attempt at commercial success.  He created a more 'dance-orientated' garage influenced album called 'Be'.  Two singles preceded the intended release of the album.  Both singles ('Easy' and 'Working') again failed to hit.  At the last moment (promos had been sent out and reviews were already written!) the record company pulled the album and dropped David from the label.\n\nDuring this period Bernard Butler had also released two solo albums, and had lost his label deal at the collapse of Creation Records.  Bernard had written a number of songs which he thought sounded like 'McAlmont and Butler' songs and both artists were able to make up and record a further album 2002's 'Bring it Back'.  The album was a Motown-esque pop album.  'Falling' was a hit single just failing to reach the top 10, and the title song was a further minor chart hit.  The album was positively reviewed and reached the Top 40 chart.  McAlmont and Butler started work on a third album and recorded songs 'Freak' and 'Speed' but were again dropped from EMI due to disappointing sales.\n\nIt was during this time that Bernard also 'made up' with the lead singer of Suede Brett Anderson and they formed a new band called 'The Tears' releasing and promoting an album.\n\nThe McAlmont and Butler project was put on indefinite hold and David again recorded solo.  Again, he changed his sound dramatically and headed down a 'jazz pop' route inspired by one of his favourite artists jazz singer Cassandra Wilson.  The album (Set One - You Go To My Head)\n was released on an independent label with little promotion except a few articles in the broadsheets which re-iterated the overlooked talent of David McAlmont.  One song was released to radio - a brilliant cover of 'Saving All My Love' the Whitney Houston recorded song.  It garnered some interest due to McAlmont (an out gay man) singing the song to a married family man.  There are a few other notable songs on the record - a further Shirley Bassey cover (he had previously had a minor hit with a version of 'Diamonds are Forever' with David Arnold) 'Never Never Never' and the title track 'You Go To My Head'.\n\nDuring 2006 McAlmont and Butler released a 'one off' song from their recording session for the abandoned third album - 'Speed' it was well received by the press and gained the 'record of the week' by the Sun newspaper!\n\nFans are anticipating the release of 'Set Two'.  For David McAlmont information check his myspace \nwebpages.\n\nIn 2012, David along with Guy Davies have formed a new band, Fingersnap and are performing successfully  in and around London.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+McAlmont\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
