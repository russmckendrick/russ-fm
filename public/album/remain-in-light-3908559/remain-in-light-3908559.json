      "biography": "Talking Heads were a new wave band which formed in 1975 in New York City, New York, United States. The band originally consisted of David Byrne (vocals, guitar), Tina Weymouth (bass) and Chris Frantz (drums), who had met while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. The band added Jerry Harrison (keyboards & guitar) in April 1977. The band released eight studio albums before disbanding in 1991. Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nTalking Heads first appeared on the New York music scene as a trio in 1974. At the time, the band consisted only of Byrne and Frantz, and was initially called The Artistics. By 1975, the band had recorded a demo album for CBS Records and landed a gig opening for the Ramones at CBGB in June 1975, which was the first time the band used the name Talking Heads. The band was signed to Sire Records in late 1976 and the group released their first single, \"Love → Building on Fire\" in February 1977. In March 1977, the band added Jerry Harrison, formerly of Jonathan Richman's band The Modern Lovers.  \n\nTheir first album, Talking Heads: 77 was released soon afterward and did not contain the earlier single, although it did include the underground singles Psycho Killer and Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town. Despite being regulars at New York's legendary CBGB, the band only began to break through further with the landmark Brian Eno-produced, 1978 album More Songs About Buildings And Food, an album which continued in the same vein, but with a more accessible style, wittier lyrics, and ultimately better songs. It was a great critical hit with subject matter ranging from home movies to the art world.  It also included their cover of Take Me To The River. On the following year's Fear Of Music the band started to dabble in African rhythms, notably on I Zimbra, and more straightforward pop styles, on Life During Wartime and Cities.\n\n1980 brought the band's fourth and most innovative effort Remain In Light. Notable for the single Once In A Lifetime, which became an early MTV staple, Remain In Light saw the band experiment with ambient sounds, fugal structures, polyrhythms, and about everything under the sun to make the body groove. Following this, the group split with Brian Eno, enjoying greater commercial success with 1983's Speaking In Tongues. It took the musical innovations of its predecessor and refined them into pop songs, most notably Burning Down The House, Girlfriend Is Better and This Must Be The Place. This period was topped off with a live album, from Jonathan Demme's documentary, Stop Making Sense. The documentary, with its name taken from a line in Girlfriend Is Better, was a great success, and took their inimitable style to a wider audience.\n\n1985's Little Creatures was an even bigger hit, and exhibited another stylistic shift for the band. It saw the punk styles of '77 almost completely abandoned for simple, three or four chord pop songs. The album produced the singles And She Was, and Road To Nowhere. The following two albums, True Stories and Naked, were both moderate successes, the former producing their biggest radio hits, Love For Sale and Wild Wild Life,  and the latter focusing more on Latin influences with hits like (Nothing But) Flowers.  After this, a long quiet period followed, with the band eventually officially announcing their break up in 1991. Since the split, Byrne continued his solo career and Weymoth and Frantz continued to record and tour as Tom Tom Club. Weymouth, Harrison and Frantz reunited for an album, \"No Talking, Just Head\", recorded under the name The Heads in 1996.\n\nThe band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. The band reunited for a three song performance at the ceremony. Due to personality conflicts between Byrne and the other members, further reunions are unlikely.\n\nwww.talking-heads.net <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> Talking Heads and their producer Brian Eno shared a love of African music, especially the work of Nigerian firebrand Fela Kuti, who built 15- to 20-minute songs out of repeated funk and jazz riffs. Fela was one of the strongest influences on <i>Remain in Light</i>, the fourth Talking Heads record, which is often ranked (justly!) as one of the greatest albums ever. \n\nThere’d never been a prominent rock band that explored polyrhythms this thoroughly and ably. All four band members and Eno played multiple instruments on the album’s eight songs, and they also brought in percussionists, guitarist Adrian Belew (who’d recently played with David Bowie), the fantastic soul singer Nona Hendryx of Labelle, and avant-garde trumpeter Jon Hassell, who adds a tart melody line to “Houses in Motion”. \n\nTalking Heads albums are always conceptually sound, but they’re also physically satisfying, and the cross-current rhythms and musical hooks on <i>Remain in Light</i> give the album a kind of brute force. The band was also savvy enough by now to add small touches that rooted the music to pop traditions: a cowbell on “Crosseyed and Painless”, Hendryx’s prominent background vocal on “The Great Curve” and Tina Weymouth’s see-saw, six-note bass on “Once In a Lifetime.”\n\nSinger David Byrne’s interest in non-American cultures led him to the atmospheric song “Listening Wind”, which describes the stealthy actions of a man named Mojique, a bomber who targets the colonialist Americans who’ve begun living in his country. Where Mojique lives isn’t specified (there are hints of North Africa), and maybe that’s the point—there are many countries where Americans have made themselves unwelcome. Byrne wrote the song in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis, which may have influenced him. \n\nThe album describes terrorism and danger (and on the last song, “The Overload”, dread as well), but the overall mood of these thick, extended jams is ebullience, in the music as well as the lyrics. “The world moves on a woman’s hips,” Byrne whoops on “The Great Curve”, a celebration of sexuality and physical joy, in which the singer escapes from existential angst into a “world of light.” ",

            "content": "Remain in Light is the fourth studio album by American new wave band Talking Heads, released on October 8, 1980, on Sire Records. It was recorded at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas and Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia between July and August 1980 and was produced by the quartet's long-time collaborator Brian Eno.\n\nFollowing the release of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of the group as a mere vehicle for frontman and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.\n\nByrne initially struggled with writer's block, but soon adopted a scattered stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The artwork for Remain in Light was conceived by bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, and was crafted with the help of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computers and design company M&Co. Talking Heads expanded to nine members for a promotional tour, and following its completion the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side-projects. The album was the last of the band's collaborations with Eno, though Eno and Byrne's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts would be released the following year.\n\nRemain in Light was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its sonic experimentation, rhythmic innovations, and cohesive merging of disparate genres. The album peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 in the US and at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Remain in Light: \"Once in a Lifetime\" and \"Houses in Motion\". The record was certified Gold in the US and in Canada during the 1980s. It has been featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and the best albums of all time, and it is often considered Talking Heads' magnum opus. In 2006, it was remastered and reissued with the addition of four unfinished outtakes. The Library of Congress deemed the album \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant\", and selected it for preservation in their National Recording Registry in 2017. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads/Remain+in+Light\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
