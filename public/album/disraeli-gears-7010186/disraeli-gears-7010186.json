      "biography": "In the eyes of their audience, the three musicians in Cream represented the best players of their respective instruments - the \"cream\" of British rock musicianship, as it were. The blues-rock trio came together in 1966. Already, Clapton had attained recognition as Britain’s preeminent guitarist as a result of his tenure with the Yardbirds and John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. Bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker boasted an impressive pedigree as well, having been the rhythm section for the Graham Bond Organization, a blues-jazz band fronted by organist-singer Bond.\n\nDriven by thoughts of moving from straight blues into a new kind of pop music - one that took note of directions emerging from London’s underground scene - Baker approached Clapton about forming a band. Clapton’s sole proviso was that Jack Bruce must be the bassist. As rock’s first \"supergroup\" Cream aimed to break new ground, according to Clapton in an interview from that time, \"What we want to do is anything that people haven’t done before\" he said. In actuality, the group remained grounded in the blues while expanding the vocabulary of rock with extended improvisations during their live shows and forays into psychedelia on record.\n\nCream's debut album, Fresh Cream, mixed blues standards (\"I’m So Glad\", \"Spoonful\") with original compositions (\"I Feel Free\", \"N.S.U.\"). On Disraeli Gears, the band's second album, the group dove headlong into a fanciful world of psychedelic sounds and textures while retaining a blues-rock underpinning. Cream ranks among the vanguard musicians of that genre with such mind-bending numbers as \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love.\" Wheels of Fire, a double album from 1968, displayed the group’s split personality. One disc was given over to song-oriented studio recordings (e.g. \"White Room\"), while the other consisted of live tracks (including their definitive rock version of Robert Johnson’s \"Crossroads\") recorded at the Fillmore in San Francisco.\n\nIn July 1968, Cream announced they were disbanding at the end of the year. They played their farewell show on November 26, 1968, at London’s Albert Hall, and released the album Goodbye two months later. During Cream's brief two-year history, the group of singularly gifted musicians made groundbreaking music and epitomized the questing spirit of their art. \"Eric, Ginger and I wanted to turn each other on\", Jack Bruce said later. \"The only good music is when good musicians play for each other. I believe that’s what made Cream so different from the other rock groups.\"",

            "content": "Disraeli Gears is the second album by British blues-rock group Cream. It was released in November 1967 and went on to reach #5 on the UK album chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming a massive seller there in 1968, reaching #4 on the American charts. The album features the two singles \"Strange Brew\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love\". By this time, the group was veering quite heavily away from their blues roots to indulge in more psychedelic sounds.\n\nThe title of the album was taken from an inside joke. Eric Clapton had been thinking of buying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner commented, \"it's got them Disraeli Gears\", meaning to say \"derailleur gears,\" but instead alluding to 19th Century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and decided that it should be the title of their next album. Had it not been for Mick's turn of phrase, the album would simply have been entitled \"Cream.\"\n\nClapton, Baker, and Jack Bruce all contributed songs with the help of lyricist Pete Brown and producer Felix Pappalardi. The track \"Blue Condition\" was unusual in that Baker, although not well known for his singing, took the lead vocal. The album was recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York during May 1967, following the band's nine shows as part of Murray the K's \"Music in the 5th Dimension\" concert series. Cream's American label, ATCO, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantic Records.\n\nThe psychedelic cover art was created by Australian artist Martin Sharp, who lived in the same building as Clapton at the time of the Chelsea artists colony The Pheasantry. At their first meeting in a London club, Clapton mentioned that he had some music that needed lyrics, so Sharp wrote out a poem he had composed on a napkin and gave it to Clapton, who recorded it as \"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\"\n\nWhen interviewed on the episode of the VH1 show, Classic Albums, which featured Disraeli Gears, Bruce stated that when writing the song \"Take it Back\", he had been inspired by the contemporary media images of American students burning their draft cards and wrote the song in that spirit of rejecting militarism.\n\nIn 2004, the album was released as a 2-disc Deluxe edition including the complete album in both mono and stereo, demos, alternate takes and tracks taken from the band's live sessions on BBC radio. In 2003 the album was ranked number 112 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
