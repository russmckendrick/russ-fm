      "biography": "Rancid is an American punk rock band formed in Berkeley, California in 1991. Founded by Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, former members of the band Operation Ivy, Rancid is often credited as being among the wave of bands that revived mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States during the mid-1990s. Over their 32-year career, Rancid retained much of its original fan-base, most of which was connected to its underground musical roots.\n\nRancid has had two lineup changes since its inception, with Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman being continuous members. Their current lineup consists of Armstrong on guitar and vocals, Freeman on bass and vocals, Lars Frederiksen on guitar and vocals, and Branden Steineckert on drums. The band was formed by Armstrong, Freeman, and former drummer Brett Reed, who left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Steineckert. This lineup recorded their first album, with Frederiksen joining the band on their subsequent tour.\n\nTo date, Rancid has released ten studio albums, one split album, one compilation, two extended plays, and a series of live online-only albums, and has been featured on a number of compilation albums. The band has sold over four million records worldwide, making it one of the most successful punk rock groups of all time. The band rose to fame in 1994 with its second studio album, Let's Go, featuring the single \"Salvation\". In the following year, Rancid released its highly successful album ...And Out Come the Wolves, which produced its best-known songs \"Roots Radicals\", \"Ruby Soho\", and \"Time Bomb\", and was certified gold and platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies in the United States alone. Its next six albums – Life Won't Wait (1998), Rancid (2000), Indestructible (2003), Let the Dominoes Fall (2009), ...Honor Is All We Know (2014) and Trouble Maker (2017) – were also critically acclaimed, though not as commercially successful as ...And Out Come the Wolves. The band released their tenth album, Tomorrow Never Comes, in June 2023.\n\nStudio albums\nRancid (1993)\nLet's Go (1994)\n...And Out Come the Wolves (1995)\nLife Won't Wait (1998)\nRancid (also known as \"Rancid 2000\" or \"Rancid 5\") (2000)\nIndestructible (2003)\nLet the Dominoes Fall (2009)\n...Honor Is All We Know (2014)\nTrouble Maker (2017)\nTomorrow Never Comes (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rancid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "…And Out Come the Wolves is an album by the American punk rock band Rancid, released in August 1995 (see 1995 in music).\n\nRancid's popularity and catchy songs made them the subject of a major label bidding war (hence the title, ...And Out Come the Wolves taken from a poem in Jim Carroll's Basketball Diaries) that ended with the band sticking with their indie label, Epitaph Records. With a sound heavily influenced by ska, which called to mind Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman's past in Operation Ivy, Rancid became one of the few bands of the mid- to late-1990s boom in punk to retain much of its original fanbase.\n\nIn terms of record sales and certifications, …And Out Come the Wolves is a popular album in the United States. It produced three hit singles – \"Roots Radicals\", \"Time Bomb\" and \"Ruby Soho\" – that earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. All the singles charted on Modern Rock Tracks. …And Out Come the Wolves has continued to sell consistently well in the fourteen years since its release, and on January 22, 1996 was certified gold by the RIAA. It was also certified platinum on September 23, 2004.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, ...And Out Come the Wolves—along with Green Day's Dookie and The Offspring's Smash—helped revive mainstream popular interest in punk rock, and signaled the initial rise of mainstream punk and proved to be a massive success for the band.\n\nBackground\nRancid formed in Albany, California in 1991. They signed to Epitaph Records (founded by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz) in 1992 and released their first album, which is self-titled, a year later to rave reviews. While Rancid was already writing another album, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, one of the band's friends, joined them to co-write the song \"Radio\". This led to him playing a live show with the band, and Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong eventually asked him to become a member of the band, but he decided to continue playing in Green Day. Armstrong had previously asked Lars Frederiksen to be Rancid's second guitarist, but he turned down the request. After Billie Joe declined, Frederiksen changed his mind and decided to join the band. Rancid's second album, Let's Go, was released in 1994 to unexpected success and acclaim. After the release of Green Day's Dookie and The Offspring's Smash later that year, Rancid was pursued by several major labels, including Madonna's Maverick Records, but eventually turned them down. They decided to stay on Epitaph and soon began recording a follow-up album.\n\n\nRecording and production\n...And Out Come the Wolves was recorded mainly between February and May 1995. The recording took place at not only Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California (where Let's Go was recorded), but also at the famous Electric Lady Studios (built by the late Jimi Hendrix) in New York City. This is the first time Rancid recorded a record at more than one studio. Jerry Finn reprised his role as the album's producer.\n\n\nRelease and reception\n...And Out Come the Wolves was released on August 22, 1995 and peaked at number 45 on the Billboard 200 album chart.Five months after its release, the album was certified gold.\n\nThe album received positive reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the album as having \"classic moments of revivalist punk\". Erlewine praised the music and claims the album \"doesn't mark an isolationist retreat into didactic, defiantly underground punk rock\". The album received a rating of four and a half out of five stars, while \"Time Bomb\", \"Ruby Soho\" and \"Roots Radicals\" earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date.\nLegacy\nThe album is referenced in Stephen King's novel Desperation as an album that one of the characters was saving a stamp at Tower Records frequent shopper card for.\n\n\nArtwork\nThe cover art is a tribute to Minor Threat, a landmark hardcore punk band, that originally used the image of Alec MacKaye (brother of the band's lead singer Ian MacKaye) with his head on his knees on steps of the \"Dischord House\" on the self-titled EP.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and composed by Tim Armstrong, Lars Frederiksen and Matt Freeman, except where noted. \n\n# Title Length \n1. \"Maxwell Murder\"   1:25 \n2. \"The 11th Hour\" (Erik Dinn) 2:28 \n3. \"Roots Radicals\"   2:47 \n4. \"Time Bomb\"   2:24 \n5. \"Olympia WA.\"   3:30 \n6. \"Lock, Step & Gone\"   2:25 \n7. \"Junkie Man\"   3:04 \n8. \"Listed M.I.A.\"   2:22 \n9. \"Ruby Soho\"   2:37 \n10. \"Daly City Train\"   3:21 \n11. \"Journey to the End of the East Bay\"   3:11 \n12. \"She's Automatic\"   1:35 \n13. \"Old Friend\"   2:53 \n14. \"Disorder and Disarray\"   2:49 \n15. \"The Wars End\"   1:53 \n16. \"You Don't Care Nothin'\"   2:28 \n17. \"As Wicked\"   2:40 \n18. \"Avenues & Alleyways\"   3:11 \n19. \"The Way I Feel\"   2:34 \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rancid/...And+Out+Come+the+Wolves\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
