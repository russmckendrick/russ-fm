      "biography": "Philip David Charles Collins (born 30 January 1951) is an English singer, musician, songwriter, record producer and actor. He was the drummer and lead singer of the rock band Genesis and also has a career as a solo performer. Between 1982 and 1990, Collins scored three UK and seven US number-one singles as a solo artist. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, he had more US top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s. His most successful singles from the period include \"In the Air Tonight\", \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\", \"One More Night\", and \"Another Day in Paradise\".\n\nBorn and raised in west London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor, with his first major role, aged 13, as the Artful Dodger in the West End musical Oliver!. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing the albums Face Value (1981), Hello, I Must Be Going! (1982), No Jacket Required (1985) and ...But Seriously (1989). Collins became, in the words of AllMusic, \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\". He also became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. In 1985, he was the only artist to perform at both Live Aid concerts. He also resumed his acting career, appearing in Miami Vice and subsequently starring in the film Buster (1988). In 1996, Collins left Genesis to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for Disney's Tarzan (1999) for which he received an Oscar for Best Original Song for \"You'll Be in My Heart\". He rejoined Genesis for their Turn It On Again Tour in 2007. Following a five-year retirement to focus on his family life, Collins released an autobiography in 2016 and completed his Not Dead Yet Tour in 2019. He then rejoined Genesis in 2020 for a second reunion tour, ending in March 2022.\n\nCollins's discography includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150 million records sold worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He is one of only three recording artists, along with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, who have sold over 100 million records both as solo artists and separately as principal members of a band. He has won eight Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards (winning Best British Male Artist three times), two Golden Globe Awards, one Academy Award, and a Disney Legend Award. He was awarded six Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the International Achievement Award. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999, and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. He has also been recognised by music publications with induction into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2012, and the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collins\n\nStudio albums\nFace Value (1981)\nHello, I Must Be Going!

But 1985 was truly the Year of the Phil, when, in the wake of Genesis’ self-titled 1983 chart-topper and his own GRAMMYⓇ-winning theme song for the film <i>Against All Odds</i>, Collins dropped his blockbuster third record, <i>No Jacket Required</i>. The album not only served as the height of Collins’ incomparable ‘80s hot streak, it also became a defining sonic document of the era—with all the sax solos, squealing guitars, glossy synths and percolating programmed drum beats to prove it.<br />\nUp to this point in his solo career, Collins tended to vacillate between reverential ‘60s-retro homage and modern production techniques, but <i>No Jacket Required</i> effortlessly fused the two into a glitzy Motown-meets-MTV sound every bit as funky and frisky as what pop juggernauts like Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson were pumping out at the time. On irresistible opener “Sussudio” and its similarly styled companion “Who Said I Would”, Collins proved that he too could party like it’s 1999, with synth stabs and brass jabs that thrust you onto the dance floor with all the subtlety of an electric cattle prod. The album also reinforced Collins’ status as a master balladeer, whether he was slinking into the soft-focus romantic reverie “One More Night” or wading into politically charged terrain on the equally exotic and ominous “Long Long Way to Go”. But on a record where every song could’ve been a hit single—and half of them actually were—Collins saves the best for last with the towering “Take Me Home”. It’s a track that perfectly encapsulates his ‘80s imperial phase, where even a song that grimly details a man’s descent into madness couldn’t help but sound like a heaven-sent inspirational anthem.",

            "content": "No Jacket Required is the third solo studio album by English singer-songwriter Phil Collins, the lead vocalist and drummer for the rock band Genesis. The album was originally released on 25 January 1985 on Virgin (UK and Ireland), Atlantic (US and Canada), and WEA (Rest of the world). It features guest backing vocalists, including Helen Terry, Peter Gabriel and Sting. Some of the songs, like \"Don't Lose My Number\" and \"Sussudio\", were based around improvisation. Other songs, like \"Long Long Way to Go\", had a political message. \"One More Night\", \"Sussudio\", \"Don't Lose My Number\", and \"Take Me Home\" were all released as singles, with corresponding music videos. All four singles were top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with \"Sussudio\" and \"One More Night\" reaching number one. The three singles that were released in the UK all reached the top 20 on the UK charts.\n\nOn release, the album was received favourably by the majority of music critics, although opinions have become more negative in subsequent decades and it has rarely been featured in \"Best Albums of the 1980s\" lists since. It won three Grammy Awards including for Album of the Year in 1986. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that Collins was \"quietly revolutionising and expanding the role of the drums in pop record making\". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote that, \"Like his '81 and '82 outings, Face Value and Hello, I Must Be Going!, No Jacket Required is not an album that waits to be liked\". Collins' most commercially successful solo album, it went on to peak at number one in several countries, including the US (where it was at the top of the charts for seven weeks), the UK and Canada. According to the RIAA, the record sold over twelve million copies in the US, and in the UK, the album sold over two million copies, and was certified 6× platinum. It was the second best-selling album of 1985 in the UK. Worldwide, the album has sold over 25 million copies.\n\nMany of the songs, including \"Take Me Home\", and \"Long Long Way to Go\", have been featured in episodes of Miami Vice and Cold Case, and \"The Man with the Horn\" was re-written and re-recorded for the episode \"Phil the Shill\". \"We Said Hello Goodbye\" was remixed for the film Playing for Keeps.\n\nFollowing the release of the album Collins embarked on the successful No Jacket Required World Tour. At the end of that tour, Collins received critical acclaim for performing at both the London and Philadelphia Live Aid concerts on 13 July 1985. During the tour, Collins recorded a song with Marilyn Martin for the movie White Nights, called \"Separate Lives\", which was a number one hit in the US, and a top ten hit in the UK. Remixes of six songs from the album were later included on the 12\"ers compilation album, released in 1987. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins/No+Jacket+Required\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Worldwide, the album has sold over 25 million copies.\n\nMany of the songs, including \"Take Me Home\", and \"Long Long Way to Go\", have been featured in episodes of Miami Vice and Cold Case, and \"The Man with the Horn\" was re-written and re-recorded for the episode \"Phil the Shill\". \"We Said Hello Goodbye\" was remixed for the film Playing for Keeps.\n\nFollowing the release of the album Collins embarked on the successful No Jacket Required World Tour. At the end of that tour, Collins received critical acclaim for performing at both the London and Philadelphia Live Aid concerts on 13 July 1985. During the tour, Collins recorded a song with Marilyn Martin for the movie White Nights, called \"Separate Lives\", which was a number one hit in the US, and a top ten hit in the UK. Remixes of six songs from the album were later included on the 12\"ers compilation album, released in 1987. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Phil+Collins/No+Jacket+Required\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
