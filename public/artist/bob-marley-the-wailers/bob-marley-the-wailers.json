  "biography": "Bob Marley and the Wailers (previously known as The Wailers, and prior to that The Wailing Rudeboys, The Wailing Wailers and The Teenagers) were a Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae band. The founding members, in 1963, were Bob Marley (Robert Nesta Marley), Peter Tosh (Hubert Winston McIntosh), and Bunny Wailer (Neville Livingston).\n\nDuring 1970 and 1971, Wailer, Marley and Tosh worked with renowned reggae producers Leslie Kong and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry.\n\nThey released four albums before signing to Island Records in 1972. Two more albums were created before Tosh and Wailer left the band in 1974, citing grievances over label treatment and ideological differences. Marley carried on with a new line-up, including the I-Threes that put out seven more more albums. Marley died in 1981.\n\nThe Wailers were a groundbreaking ska and reggae group, noted for songs such as \"Simmer Down\", \"Trenchtown Rock\", \"Nice Time\", \"War\", \"Stir It Up\" and \"Get Up, Stand Up\".\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley_and_the_Wailers\n\nStudio albums\nThe Wailing Wailers (1965)\nThe Best of the Wailers (1970; released 1971)\nSoul Rebels (1970)\nSoul Revolution Part II (1971)\nCatch a Fire (1973)\nBurnin' (1973)\nNatty Dread (1974)\nRastaman Vibration (1976)\nExodus (1977)\nKaya (1978)\nSurvival (1979)\nUprising (1980)\nConfrontation (1983) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&+The+Wailers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
