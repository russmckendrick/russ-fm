      "biography": "Daniel Dumile (July 13, 1971 – October 31, 2020) was a British-American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He performed and released music under a variety of stage names, most notably MF DOOM, which Dumile preferred to be stylized in all caps. Dumile debuted during hip-hop's golden age of the late 1980s and became a major figure in underground hip-hop of the early 21st century. He is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Being dubbed as \"Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper\".\n\nBorn in London, Dumile moved with his family to Long Island, New York, at a young age. He began his musical career in 1988 as a member of the East Coast hip-hop trio KMD, performing under the name Zev Love X. KMD disbanded in 1993 following the death of Dumile's brother, DJ Subroc. After a hiatus from the music scene, Dumile reemerged in 1998, performing at open mic events while wearing a mask. He adopted the MF DOOM persona and rarely appeared unmasked in public thereafter. His iconic metal mask resembled that of Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom, who is depicted rapping on the cover of his 1999 debut solo album Operation: Doomsday. In the early 2000s, Dumile also released solo albums under the pseudonyms King Geedorah and Viktor Vaughn.\n\nMF DOOM appeared in several collaborative projects, including Madvillain (with Madlib), DANGERDOOM (with Danger Mouse), DOOMSTARKS (with Ghostface Killah), JJ DOOM (with Jneiro Jarel), NEHRUVIANDOOM (with Bishop Nehru), and Czarface Meets Metal Face (with CZARFACE).\n\nDumile was born to a Trinidadian mother and a Zimbabwean father. His family moved to Long Island, New York, during his childhood, but he retained British citizenship throughout his life. Dumile grew up in Freeport, New York, and began DJ'ing in elementary school. After relocating to London in 2009, he continued to release music while living abroad. Dumile was a follower of the Nuwaubian Nation and often incorporated esoteric themes into his work.\n\nDumile created the MF DOOM persona as an alter ego with a detailed backstory, blending elements from Doctor Doom, Destro, and the Phantom of the Opera. His signature mask, inspired by Doctor Doom and later adapted from a prop in Gladiator, became a defining feature of his public image. Dumile’s character-driven approach to music allowed him to critique the music industry and explore themes of identity, alienation, and power.\n\nKnown for his intricate wordplay, free-association rhyme schemes, and unconventional production style, MF DOOM influenced countless contemporary artists. His music drew inspiration from cartoons, comic books, and other realms of pop culture, cementing his reputation as a boundary-pushing artist.\n\nFollowing Dumile's death, announced by his wife Jasmine on December 31, 2020, tributes poured in from fans and fellow artists alike. He was celebrated as a genius of lyricism and one of hip-hop's most enigmatic figures. Artists such as Thom Yorke, El-P, and Q-Tip acknowledged his profound influence, describing him as a transformative figure in the music world.\n\nDumile's legacy continues to thrive. His albums, particularly Madvillainy and Operation: Doomsday, are regarded as classics that resonate with new generations of listeners. Documentaries, retrospectives, and scholarly works further explore his impact, solidifying MF DOOM’s place as a cornerstone of hip-hop history. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Part of that was his surreal origin story—after tragedy derailed his ’90s rap career, Dumile returned metal-masked and seeking revenge against the industry that wronged him. But most of his rep came from raw talent: a tumble of clever rhyme schemes and punchlines set to a loping score of rough-cut jazz loops and vintage film snippets. While his cachet would carry DOOM into collabs with members of Radiohead, Wu-Tang and even <i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</i>, <i>MM...Food</i> finds him in the early days of his crossover appeal, totally ignoring his own hype. While many concept albums lean toward the esoteric or idea-stuffed, this one is built on an almost tauntingly basic conceit: throw DOOM a topic (food) and watch the wordplay go. <br />\nOn opener “Beef Rapp”, he delves into the mortal dangers of, well, rap beef: “I suggest you change your diet/It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it.” And “Hoe Cakes” toys with another hip-hop trope—dastardly deeds done after dark. But lest you think the culinary connections are all easily parsed, try “Potholderz” on for size: DOOM finds at least four meanings for these kitchen aids, casting them in one instance as tools that help him cook up and cannibalise lesser MCs. <br />\nMetal Fingers flexes his producer skills, too, packing the album’s midsection with jaunty sound collages that use Fat Albert and Frank Zappa samples to extend the edible metaphor. But nothing beats hearing DOOM croon his best/worst Cole Porter impression over a Madlib track, then binge-rap a two-minute verse inspired by beer. MM...Food captures Dumile at his most unburdened, making these songs as nourishing as they are fun.",

            "content": "MM..FOOD is the classic fifth studio album by British-American rapper and producer MF DOOM. It was released via Rhymesayers Entertainment on November 16, 2004. It peaked at number 17 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart, and number 9 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. The title, \"MM.. FOOD\" is an anagram of \"MF DOOM\".\n\nMF DOOM described MM...FOOD as a concept album \"about the things you find on a picnic, or at a picnic table\". The album's titles and lyrics contain references to different foods, some with common metaphors and double entendres in the \"street world\" and the \"nutritional realm\".\n\nThe album is primarily produced by MF DOOM, except for the tracks \"Potholderz\", produced by Count Bass D; \"One Beer\", produced by Madlib and originally intended for the joint Madlib and MF DOOM album Madvillainy; and \"Kon Queso\" produced by PNS of Molemen. MM...FOOD features guest appearances from Count Bass D, Angelika, 4ize, and Mr. Fantastik.\n\n\"Kon Queso\" was originally released under the name \"Yee Haw\" on a 12-inch single in July 2003 with Molemen. The track was re-recorded for MM...FOOD  with a more laidback performance from MF DOOM. \"Vomitspit\" is a new version of the song \"Vomit\", with a different beat and some changed lyrics. The original release of the album included a different version of \"Kookies\". It was removed due to an unlicensed sample from Sesame Street and was promptly changed to a simpler version of the song in all future physical and digital releases.\n\nA bonus disc titled Mm..LeftOvers containing throwaway tracks and remixes from the album was released on November 16, 2004, on Hiphopsite.com. It was given away with copies of MM...FOOD. The CD contained a recipe for \"Villainous Mac & Cheese\" by Grammy Dumile on the back of the CD insert.\n\nGarnering universal acclaim upon release, the album received an average score of 81 from Metacritic, based on 22 reviews. Ryan Dombal of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"MM...FOOD flips countless edible metaphors over hard-hitting, jazzy beats, while never devolving into pointless parody.\" David Jeffries of AllMusic called it \"as vital as anything he's done before and entirely untouched or stymied by the hype.\" Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester called MM...FOOD \"an attempt to make good on Doom's almost fascist conceit to restore rap's golden age despite its loss of innocence.\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called the album \"a crazy pastiche tied loopily together around obsessions with food, comic books, and supervillainy\" and wrote that Doom is \"exempt from the law of diminishing returns.\"\n\nIn 2012, Stereogum named it the best MF DOOM album. In 2015, NME named it \"one of the 23 maddest and most memorable concept albums.\" Complex named the song \"Rapp Snitch Knishes\" the \"22nd funniest rap song of all time.\"\n\nThe album cover art was directed by Stones Throw's art director Jeff Jank, and painted by Jason Jagel. The original painting included a blunt that was later edited out. The 2007 vinyl edition was mastered with tracks 3 and 4 switched. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM/MM..FOOD\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "MM..FOOD is the classic fifth studio album by British-American rapper and producer MF DOOM. It was released via Rhymesayers Entertainment on November 16, 2004. It peaked at number 17 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart, and number 9 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. The title, \"MM.. FOOD\" is an anagram of \"MF DOOM\".\n\nMF DOOM described MM...FOOD as a concept album \"about the things you find on a picnic, or at a picnic table\". The album's titles and lyrics contain references to different foods, some with common metaphors and double entendres in the \"street world\" and the \"nutritional realm\".\n\nThe album is primarily produced by MF DOOM, except for the tracks \"Potholderz\", produced by Count Bass D; \"One Beer\", produced by Madlib and originally intended for the joint Madlib and MF DOOM album Madvillainy; and \"Kon Queso\" produced by PNS of Molemen. MM...FOOD features guest appearances from Count Bass D, Angelika, 4ize, and Mr. Fantastik.\n\n\"Kon Queso\" was originally released under the name \"Yee Haw\" on a 12-inch single in July 2003 with Molemen. The track was re-recorded for MM...FOOD  with a more laidback performance from MF DOOM. \"Vomitspit\" is a new version of the song \"Vomit\", with a different beat and some changed lyrics. The original release of the album included a different version of \"Kookies\". It was removed due to an unlicensed sample from Sesame Street and was promptly changed to a simpler version of the song in all future physical and digital releases.\n\nA bonus disc titled Mm..LeftOvers containing throwaway tracks and remixes from the album was released on November 16, 2004, on Hiphopsite.com. It was given away with copies of MM...FOOD. The CD contained a recipe for \"Villainous Mac & Cheese\" by Grammy Dumile on the back of the CD insert.\n\nGarnering universal acclaim upon release, the album received an average score of 81 from Metacritic, based on 22 reviews. Ryan Dombal of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"MM...FOOD flips countless edible metaphors over hard-hitting, jazzy beats, while never devolving into pointless parody.\" David Jeffries of AllMusic called it \"as vital as anything he's done before and entirely untouched or stymied by the hype.\" Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester called MM...FOOD \"an attempt to make good on Doom's almost fascist conceit to restore rap's golden age despite its loss of innocence.\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called the album \"a crazy pastiche tied loopily together around obsessions with food, comic books, and supervillainy\" and wrote that Doom is \"exempt from the law of diminishing returns.\"\n\nIn 2012, Stereogum named it the best MF DOOM album. In 2015, NME named it \"one of the 23 maddest and most memorable concept albums.\" Complex named the song \"Rapp Snitch Knishes\" the \"22nd funniest rap song of all time.\"\n\nThe album cover art was directed by Stones Throw's art director Jeff Jank, and painted by Jason Jagel. The original painting included a blunt that was later edited out. The 2007 vinyl edition was mastered with tracks 3 and 4 switched. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM/MM..FOOD\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
