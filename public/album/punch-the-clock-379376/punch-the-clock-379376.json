      "biography": "Elvis Costello & The Attractions were a critically acclaimed alternative rock / new wave band formed by English musican Elvis Costello in 1977. Producing famous work in the genres of punk and new wave music, it also contained Steve Nieve (ne Nason) on keyboards, Pete Thomas on drums, and Bruce Thomas (no relation) on bass. Costello recorded and toured solidly with them until 1984, when he disbanded them to pursue solo projects. \n\nInternationally, the band is perhaps best known for popular rock hits such as \"Oliver's Army\" and \"Pump It Up\", both featuring expressive yet sardonic vocals from Costello. He reconvened the band for one-off albums and tours over the following decade, particularly from 1994 through 1996. He has also enlisted Nieve, and to a lesser extent Pete Thomas, for other recordings and performances, and this continues to the present day. Costello and Bruce Thomas have had a notoriously stormy relationship, documented in Thomas' 1990 autobiographical novel 'The Big Wheel'. The original Attractions reunited for the 'Brutal Youth & All This Useless Beauty' sessions despite Costello and Thomas' differences. Pete Thomas and Steve Nieve, along with Bruce Thomas' replacement Davey Faragher, have been a part of Costello's other most well known backing band, The Imposters.\n\nTogether, Costello and the Attractions, based out of London, England, recorded ten albums. Most of which are critically regarded as among Costello's finest. They are: 'This Year's Model' (1978); 'Armed Forces' (1979); 'Get Happy' (1980); 'Trust' (1981); 'Almost Blue' (1981); 'Imperial Bedroom' (1982); 'Punch The Clock' (1983); 'Goodbye Cruel World' (1984); 'Blood and Chocolate' (1986), and 'All This Useless Beauty' (1996). The full band plays on some, but not all, tracks on the 1994 release 'Brutal Youth', which is credited to Costello alone. In addition, The Attractions also recorded an album without Costello, titled 'Mad About the Wrong Boy', which they released in 1980.\n\nElvis Costello & The Attractions most recently appeared together, although they didn't play, when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. The band's work has continued to receive much airplay and sell quite well over the years. 'Mad About the Wrong Boy', while obscure, has been a collectors item for many new wave and power pop fans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello+&+The+Attractions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is, in many ways, a return to pure, smart pop, showing off Costello’s novelist eye for lyrical detail and tuned ear for stirring melody. Alan Winstanley and Clive Langer’s layered production helps uphold the pop grandeur. There’s sweet sing-song on “Everyday I Write the Book\", punchy, horn-drenched soul on “TKO (Boxing Day)” and a plaintive ode to working-class grief and anti-war sentiment with “Shipbuilding\". Then disjointed rhythms, countermelody and stinging wit jive together on “Love Went Mad”. ",
