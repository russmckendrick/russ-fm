  "biography": "Bomb The Bass (formed 1987, in London, England) is the umbrella title for the output of British musician and DJ, Tim Simenon. The band, which has evolved its style over the years, has been classed as electronic or dance.\n\nBomb the Bass was the creation of the British musician Tim Simenon.  His first single \"Beat Dis\" from the album \"Into the Dragon\" was a number two hit in the UK and was one of the first songs to introduce the mainstream to sampling culture (along with songs by Paul Hardcastle, M/A/R/R/S and S'Express).  The song \"Megablast\" from the album was also used in the computer game Xenon 2 Megablast.  Other hits include a cover of the Aretha Franklin track \"Say a Little Prayer\" (\"Say a Little Prayer (feat. Maureen)\") and \"Don't Make me Wait\".  The UK Top 10-Hit \"Winter in July\" is from their second album \"Unknown Territory\".  Their third album \"Clear\" features appearances from Sinéad O'Connor, Jah Wobble, Benjamin Zephaniah and a rare vocal from novelist Will Self.\n\nSimenon has also gone on to become a successful producer for other artists (Depeche Mode, etc.).  He also owns an Amsterdam-based label called \"Electric Tones\" on which he released in 2001 the \"Clear Cut\" EP which is the last to date from Bomb The Bass.\n\nThe band is back for the first time in 20 years at the London Astoria\n\nwww.bombthebass.com\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bomb+the+Bass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
