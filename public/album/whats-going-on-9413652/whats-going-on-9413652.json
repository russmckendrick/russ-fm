      "biography": "Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. (2 April 1939 - 1 April 1984) was an American soul and rnb singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, known as \"The Prince of Soul\", or \"The Prince of Motown.\" Originally a member of the doo-wop group The Moonglows, he pursued a solo career after the group disbanded and released many successful solo hits including \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", \"Let's Get It On\" and  \"What's Going On\". His best albums are still held in extremely high regard, and he is often cited as one of the finest singers of his era.\n\nMarvin Pentz Gay, Jr. was born in 1939 to Marvin Gay, Sr. and Alberta Gay in Washington, D.C.. Gaye began his career in Motown in 1958, and soon became Motown's top solo male artist. He scored numerous hits during the 1960s, among them \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\", and \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\", as well as several hit duets with Tammi Terrell, including \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"\" and \"You're All I Need to Get By\", before moving on to his own form of musical self-expression.\n\nAlong with Stevie Wonder, Gaye is notable for fighting the hit-making—but creatively restrictive—Motown record-making process, in which performers, songwriters and record producers were generally kept in separate camps. Gaye forced Motown to release his 1971 album What's Going On, which is today hailed as one of the best albums of all time. Subsequent releases proved that Gaye, who had been a part-time songwriter for Motown artists during his early years with the label, could write and produce his own singles without having to rely on the Motown system. This achievement would pave the way for the successes of later self-sufficient singer-songwriter-producers in African American music, such as Luther Vandross and Babyface.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Gaye would release several other notable albums, including Let's Get It On and I Want You, and released several successful singles such as \"Come Get to This\", \"Got to Give It Up\" and \"Sexual Healing\". By the time of his shooting death in 1984, at the hands of his clergyman father, Gaye had become one of the most influential artists of the soul music era. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Gaye\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> When Marvin Gaye brought the title track of 1971’s <i>What’s Going On</i> to Motown founder Berry Gordy, Gordy reportedly said it was the worst thing he’d ever heard. The music was too loose, the lyrics too political. Too political? Gaye countered. This is the 1970s: You’ve got the Vietnam War; you’ve got growing poverty and systemic racism; you’ve got an environment under threat. Even Elvis was singing protest songs (1969’s “In the Ghetto”)—why couldn’t Marvin Gaye?<br />\nThe album’s genius is in its lightness. Songs drift and breathe; performances feel natural, even offhand—Eli Fontaine's saxophone part on the title track, for example, was recorded when Fontaine thought he was just warming up. As Sly & The Family Stone channelled their anger into into bitter funk (1971’s <i>There’s a Riot Goin’ On</i>), Gaye sublimated his in lush string sections and Latin percussion—signals not just of musical gentleness, but cultural sophistication. Even in the face of bleakness (the addiction portrait of “Flyin’ High [In the Friendly Sky],” “Inner City Blues [Make Me Wanna Holler]”), he floats.<br />\nThe revelation is that political music doesn’t have to be confrontational—it can be mellow and inviting too, the province not just of radicals, but the same mixed, middle-class audiences that had been buying Gaye’s albums all along. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, and as Gaye seems to say on <i>What’s Going On</i>, you don’t have to be a hippie to be worried by what you see—you just have to be human.",

            "content": "What's Going On is the eleventh studio album by the American soul singer Marvin Gaye. It was released on May 21, 1971, by the Motown Records subsidiary label Tamla. Recorded between 1970 and 1971 in sessions at Hitsville U.S.A., Golden World, United Sound Studios in Detroit, and at The Sound Factory in West Hollywood, California, it was Gaye's first album to credit him as producer and to credit Motown's in-house session musicians, known as the Funk Brothers.\n\nWhat's Going On is a concept album with most of its songs segueing into the next and has been categorized as a song cycle. The narrative established by the songs is told from the point of view of a Vietnam veteran returning to his home country to witness hatred, suffering, and injustice. Gaye's introspective lyrics explore themes of drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. He has also been credited with promoting awareness of ecological issues before the public outcry over them had become prominent (\"Mercy Mercy Me\").\n\nWhat's Going On stayed on the Billboard Top LPs for over a year and became Gaye's second number-one album on Billboard's Soul LPs chart, where it stayed for nine weeks, and on the No. 2 spot for another 12 weeks, respectively. The title track, which had been released in January 1971 as the album's lead single, hit number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and held the top position on Billboard's Soul Singles chart five weeks running. The follow-up singles \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" and \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\" also reached the top 10 of the Hot 100, making Gaye the first male solo artist to place three top ten singles on the Hot 100 from one album.\n\nThe first Marvin Gaye album credited as produced solely by the artist himself, What's Going On is a unified concept album consisting of nine songs, most of which lead into the next. It has also been categorized as a song cycle; the album ends on a reprise of the album's opening theme. The album is told from the point of view of a Vietnam War veteran returning to the country he had been fighting for, and seeing nothing but injustice, suffering and hatred.\n \n\"What's Going On\" was the first album on which Motown Records' main studio band, the group of session musicians known as the Funk Brothers, received an official credit. The album features introspective lyrics and socially-conscious themes about drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. \"What's Going On\" was both an immediate commercial and critical success and has endured as a classic of early-1970s soul. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Gaye/What%27s+Going+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
