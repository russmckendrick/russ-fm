  "biography": "Bad Brains is a punk rock band formed in Washington, D.C., USA in 1977. The band is regarded as one of the pioneers of hardcore punk, though band members have objected to the term to describe their music. They are also an adept reggae band, while later recordings featured elements of other genres like funk, heavy metal, hip-hop and soul. Bad Brains are followers of the Rastafari movement.\n\nOriginally formed as a jazz fusion ensemble under the name Mind Power, Bad Brains developed a very fast and intense punk rock sound which came to be labeled \"hardcore\", and was often played faster and more emphatically than many of their peers. The unique factor of the band's music was the fact that they played more complex rhythms than other hardcore punk bands, also adapting diverse guitar styles into their songs.\n\nBad Brains have released nine studio albums (one of which is entirely composed of instrumental versions of their early material). The band broke up and reformed several times over the years, sometimes with different singers or drummers. Since 1994, the \"classic\" lineup of singer H.R. (Human Rights), guitarist Dr. Know, bassist Darryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson has reunited, albeit performing sporadically. \n\nDiscography:\n• Bad Brains (1982)\n• Rock for Light (1983)\n• I Against I (1986)\n• Quickness (1989)\n• Rise (1993)\n• God of Love (1995)\n• I & I Survived (2002)\n• Build a Nation (2007)\n• Into the Future (2012)\n• Mind Power (TBA) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Brains\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
