      "biography": "There are 3 artists named Mew:\n\n1) Mew is an alternative rock band which formed in Hellerup, Denmark in 1995. The band consists of Jonas Bjerre (vocals), Johan Wohlert, and Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen (drums).  Wohlert left the band in 2006, but returned in 2014, and is featured on all subsequent releases. When on tour, Mew is supported by Dr. Nick Watts (Headswim) on keyboard, and Mads Wegner on guitar  (original guitarist Bo Madsen (guitar) left the band in 2015.) The band's music can be described as experimental pop or as singer Jonas Bjerre mentioned in a recent interview: \"I think that we combine pop music with something that's much more experimental, in our own way. I don't think I would even try and describe it. It's difficult.\" Guitarist Bo Madsen has also classified Mew's music as \"indie stadium\".\n\nThe members of Mew started playing music together in 1995.  Mew first achieved success in Denmark with their album Frengers, although their debut album, A Triumph for Man, had been met with much critical acclaim back in 1997. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year.\" Until this point Mew was relatively unknown outside of Denmark; however after a European tour supporting R.E.M. Mew began to attract wider attention. After releasing the critically-acclaimed album And The Glass Handed Kites, featuring contributions from J Mascis from Dinosaur Jr, Mew has built on their success in Denmark as well as attracting attention from other countries in Europe and Asia. In the summer of 2006, they toured as the supporting act for Bloc Party in the U.S. as well as for Kasabian in the U.S. and Canada in the fall.

They released their seventh studio album, Visuals, after releasing a few singles in the months preceding its release. They embarked on tours for the album, as well as a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of their breakthrough album Frengers in 2018. \n\nDiscography:\n    * A Triumph for Man (1997, re-released 2006)\n    * Half the World Is Watching Me (2000, re-released Aug 2007)\n    * Frengers (2003)\n    * And the Glass Handed Kites (2005)\n    * No More Stories...
