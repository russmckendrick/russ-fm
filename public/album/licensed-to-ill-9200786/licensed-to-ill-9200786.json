      "biography": "Beastie Boys is an American hip hop band from New York City, formed in 1979. For the majority of its career, the group has consisted of three MCs and musicians Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \"MCA\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \"Ad-Rock\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar).\nOriginally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band in 1979 by Michael Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Adam Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums), the band appeared on the compilation cassette New York Thrash, before recording their first EP Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 experimental hip hop 12-inch \"Cooky Puss\", the group transitioned to hip hop in 1984 and released a string of successful 12-inch singles. The Beastie Boys toured with Madonna in 1985 and a year later released their debut album Licensed to Ill. The group sold 22 million albums in the United States and 40 million albums worldwide, making them, according to Billboard, \"the biggest-selling rap group\" since 1991.\nWith seven platinum or better albums from 1986-2004, the Beastie Boys were one of the longest-lived hip hop acts worldwide, and they continued to enjoy commercial and critical success more than 25 years after Licensed to Ill. In 2009, the group released digitally remastered deluxe editions of their albums Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head, Ill Communication and Hello Nasty. Their eighth studio album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, was released in 2011, and received positive reviews. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2012, \"just the third rap group to enter the Hall, after Run-D.M.C. (2009) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (2007).\"  The following month, MCA died of cancer of the parotid salivary gland, which led to the speculation that the other members may decide to disband the group.",

But that question misses the point: <i>Licensed to Ill</i> is one of the most colossally gleeful, goofy in-jokes ever recorded. It’s many things, in fact: it’s the product of three snotty punks who brought anarchic energy to New York’s burgeoning rap scene. It’s an homage to the flotsam and jetsam of ’80s pop culture, a rejection of the band’s upper-crust origins, and a vibrant vehicle for the tongue-in-cheek libido and exuberance of youth. And it catapulted three young men into superstardom.<br />\nThe Beastie Boys, with an able assist from producer Rick Rubin—who was still in an NYU dorm at the time—pulled off a neat trick in marrying rock’s searing edge to the verbal interplay of nascent hip-hop. And they did it without trying to hide their origins: they were three Jewish kids from Manhattan, and they rapped like it. It’s clear something is cockeyed from the first track, “Rhymin’ and Stealin’”. Samples of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath collide with bravado-drenched verses about pirates, Moby Dick, Colonel Sanders and Betty Crocker. It just gets weirder from there, with the purposely boneheaded “Fight for Your Right”, which simultaneously mocks <i>and</i> fuels party culture, and the backwards beat of “Paul Revere”, the band’s nonsensical origin story. And the anthemic “No Sleep Till Brooklyn” remains a headbanger’s delight.<br />\nBy the band’s own admission, the album’s crasser elements haven’t aged well; in 1999, Ad-Rock issued an apology for its homophobic language (the LP’s original title was <i>Don’t Be a Faggot</i>), noting that “time has healed our stupidity”. Stupidity it was. Still, while there’s nothing particularly edifying about <i>Licensed to Ill</i>, it remains one of the most unmitigated sources of fun ever committed to wax.",

            "content": "\"Licensed to Ill\" is the debut album by the Beastie Boys, released in 1986.\n\nIt is the first rap LP to top the Billboard 200 chart. It also peaked at #2 on the Top Hip Hop/R&B Albums chart. It is Columbia Records' fastest selling debut record to date and sold over five million copies.\n\nBackground\n\nProduced by Rick Rubin & Beastie Boys\n\nKerry King of Slayer made an appearance on the album playing lead guitar on \"No Sleep 'Till Brooklyn\", and appeared in the music video, which is a parody of glam metal. The name of the song itself is a spoof on Motörhead's No Sleep 'til Hammersmith album. King's appearance on the track came about because Rick Rubin was producing both bands simultaneously (Slayer's Reign in Blood was originally released on Def Jam).\n\nThe full album cover, front to back, features a Boeing 727 — with \"Beastie Boys\" emblazoned on the tail — crashing head-on into the side of a mountain. The tail of the plane has the Def Jam logo and the legend '3MTA3' which spells 'EATME' when viewed in a mirror.\n\nThe original title for this album was \"Don't Be a Faggot\" but Columbia Records flatly refused to release the album with this title and pressured Russell Simmons (their manager and label Def Jam head) into having the Beastie Boys to come up with another name. Adam Horovitz has since apologized for the band's earlier title.\n\nMusic videos were made for the songs \"Fight for Your Right\", \"No Sleep Til Brooklyn\", \"Hold It Now, Hit It\", \"Rhymin' and Stealin'\" and \"She's Crafty\".\n\nReception\n\nIn 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 217 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nVibe (12/99, p.158) - Included in Vibe's 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.\n\nQ magazine (9/94, p.123) - 4 Stars - \"Licensed to Ill\" remains the world's only punk rock rap album, arguably superior to Never Mind the Bollocks...knowing that apathy and slovenliness were just around the corner.\"\n\nMelody Maker (7/22/95, p.35) - Bloody Essential - \"There's lots of self-reverential bragging, more tenuous rhymes than are usually permitted by law and, most importantly of all, an unshakably glorious celebration of being alive....A surprisingly enduring classic.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beastie+Boys/Licensed+to+Ill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "\"Licensed to Ill\" is the debut album by the Beastie Boys, released in 1986.\n\nIt is the first rap LP to top the Billboard 200 chart. It also peaked at #2 on the Top Hip Hop/R&B Albums chart. It is Columbia Records' fastest selling debut record to date and sold over five million copies.\n\nBackground\n\nProduced by Rick Rubin & Beastie Boys\n\nKerry King of Slayer made an appearance on the album playing lead guitar on \"No Sleep 'Till Brooklyn\", and appeared in the music video, which is a parody of glam metal. The name of the song itself is a spoof on Motörhead's No Sleep 'til Hammersmith album. King's appearance on the track came about because Rick Rubin was producing both bands simultaneously (Slayer's Reign in Blood was originally released on Def Jam).\n\nThe full album cover, front to back, features a Boeing 727 — with \"Beastie Boys\" emblazoned on the tail — crashing head-on into the side of a mountain. The tail of the plane has the Def Jam logo and the legend '3MTA3' which spells 'EATME' when viewed in a mirror.\n\nThe original title for this album was \"Don't Be a Faggot\" but Columbia Records flatly refused to release the album with this title and pressured Russell Simmons (their manager and label Def Jam head) into having the Beastie Boys to come up with another name. Adam Horovitz has since apologized for the band's earlier title.\n\nMusic videos were made for the songs \"Fight for Your Right\", \"No Sleep Til Brooklyn\", \"Hold It Now, Hit It\", \"Rhymin' and Stealin'\" and \"She's Crafty\".\n\nReception\n\nIn 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 217 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nVibe (12/99, p.158) - Included in Vibe's 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.\n\nQ magazine (9/94, p.123) - 4 Stars - \"Licensed to Ill\" remains the world's only punk rock rap album, arguably superior to Never Mind the Bollocks...knowing that apathy and slovenliness were just around the corner.\"\n\nMelody Maker (7/22/95, p.35) - Bloody Essential - \"There's lots of self-reverential bragging, more tenuous rhymes than are usually permitted by law and, most importantly of all, an unshakably glorious celebration of being alive....A surprisingly enduring classic.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beastie+Boys/Licensed+to+Ill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
