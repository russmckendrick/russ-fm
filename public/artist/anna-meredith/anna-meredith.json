  "biography": "Anna Meredith is a composer and performer of electronic and acoustic music.\n\nShe has been composer in residence with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the PRS/RPS Composer in the House with Sinfonia ViVA.\n\nShe came to public attention through her 2008 work froms for the BBC Last Night of the Proms which was broadcast to 40 million people and has since written another BBC Prom commission, her first opera (Tarantula in Petrol Blue - with libretto by Philip Ridley) and collaborated with the beatboxer Shlomo - writing the Concerto for Beatboxer and Orchestra. Anna is also a judge for the BBC Young Musician of the Year, a mentor for Goldie for the TV show Classic Goldie and a frequent guest and commentator for the BBC Proms and other Radio 3 and 4 shows.\n\nShe was the classical music representative for the 2009 South Bank Show Breakthrough Award and won the 2010 Paul Hamlyn Award for Composers.\n\nAnna's most recent pieces include, Four Tributes to 4am for orchestra, electronics and visuals by Eleanor Meredith, and HandsFree, a PRS NewMusic20x12 Commission for the National Youth Orchestra, which has been called \"mesmerising\" and \"exhilarating\" by The Times, \"a tour de force\" by the Guardian and \"wicked\" by the Independent and was recently performed to great acclaim at the Proms.\n\nAlongside her acoustic work, Anna is building a reputation for her eclectic electronic work which she has performed throughout Europe alongside a diverse range of artists including supporting These New Puritans in Berlin, James Blake, Seb Rochford and Max de Wardener at Ether 2011 and a solo set at La Carrière de Normandoux. Projects in 2012 included sets at Soundwave Festival in Croatia, Ether Festival and the release of her debut EP – Black Prince Fury on Moshi Moshi Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Anna+Meredith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
