      "biography": "Steely Dan is an American jazz rock band which formed in 1972. The band was formed by Donald Fagen (vocals, keyboards) and Walter Becker (guitar, bass), who met in 1967 while both attended Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, and began a songwriting partnership shortly thereafter.\n\nTheir music is characterized by dark, witty lyrical narratives, obscure lyrical allusions and complex, jazz-influenced instrumentation and chord sequences, overlying more ordinary popular song structures. Their fastidious standards in the studio and use of world-class sessions players has also been a hallmark of their work. For this, special credit should be given to their long-time producer Gary Katz and engineer Roger Nichols.  \n\nThe band was originally a six-piece consisting of Fagen, Becker, David Palmer (vocals), Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter (guitar), Denny Dias (guitar) and Jim Hodder (drums), but by 1975, only Fagen and Becker remained.\n\nThe band's history can be divided into three stages. In its original conception, the group was a relatively conventional rock band that toured from 1972 to 1974, releasing the singles-chart successes, 'Do It Again', 'Reelin' in the Years', 'My Old School' and 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number'. The group's name was derived from a series of dildos in the 1959 novel, 'Naked Lunch' by the avant-garde writer, William S. Burroughs; the phrase first used in the lyrics of an early, pre-Steely Dan Fagen/Becker song, Soul Ram.\n\nIn its second stage (1975 - 1980) the group, now consisting solely of Fagen and Becker, became a purely studio-based act, their album releases showing a growing obsession with polished production values, and whose output became increasingly jazz-orientated, culminating in the highly successful 'Aja' (1977) and 'Gaucho' (1980). The two split in 1981 following a tumultuous recording process for the latter album, and personal problems for both members.\n\nIn the Eighties, Fagen released his seminal debut album, 'The Nightfly', and took time away from the music industry, whilst Becker, after recovering from drug dependence, was in frequent work as a producer.\n\nThe third stage came when Fagen and Becker reunited in 1993, followed by a world tour (their first touring dates in 20 years). In 2000, the Grammy-award-winning 'Two Against Nature' was released to critical and surprising commercial success. Its successor followed swiftly, 'Everything Must Go' being released in 2003. The two albums show a more relaxed attitude to production, less morbid lyrical themes and an upbeat jazz pop sound, but  with the characteristic wit and musical complexity of their 20th century work remaining. \n\nWalter Becker passed away on September 3, 2017.  This was followed by legal action between Becker's estate and Fagen over ownership of material.  Fagen with additional bandmates continues to tour as Steely Dan.\n\n--\nSteely Dan's homepage\nWikipedia article <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steely+Dan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On <i>Countdown to Ecstasy</i>, the playing is tighter (“Bodhisattva”), the lyrics are more serrated (“My Old School”) and the fusion of jazz, rock and R&B more fluid and enigmatic (“Your Gold Teeth”). But what’s a little nihilism when the licks are this tasty and the playing this incomparably smooth? Put “Your Gold Teeth” next to the grooves of something like Santana, or the country-ish tilt of “Pearl of the Quarter” next to Elton John, and you can hear how easily it must’ve been for the band to infiltrate 1970s rock radio—regardless of the subject matter.\n\nReleased in 1973, a time of national ennui, Steely Dan’s sophomore album riffs on cheating, lust and other aspects of human existence that can be uncomfortable to think about—especially for those simply seeking out some breezy entertainment: “I’m reading last year’s papers/Although I don’t know why,” declares the post-apocalyptic narrator of “King of the World”. “Assassins, cons and rapers/Might as well die.” Perhaps not surprisingly, Walter Becker and Donald Fagen would later remember playing the album for the label executives—“Hawaiian shirts, cigars and all”—and watching their disappointment unfold in real time. “The company had been hoping for a second-album blockbuster that would zoom to the top of the charts and stay there for weeks, months, years,” the duo recalled. “Instead, they found themselves with what must have sounded to them like some sort of strange neo-Weimar art music, or worse.”",
