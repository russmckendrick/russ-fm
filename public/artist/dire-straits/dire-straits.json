  "biography": "Dire Straits were a British rock band formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). They were active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.\n\nTheir first single, \"Sultans of Swing\", from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by a series of hit singles including \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1981), \"Private Investigations\" (1982), \"Twisting by the Pool\" (1983), \"Money for Nothing\" (1985), and \"Walk of Life\" (1985). Their most commercially successful album, \"Brothers in Arms\" (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc (CD) and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK history. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, the fifth most of all time.\n\nDire Straits' sound drew from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who remained with the band for its whole history. After their first breakup in 1988, Mark Knopfler told Rolling Stone: \"A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.\" They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined numerous reunion offers.\n\nDire Straits were called \"the biggest British rock band of the 80s\" by Classic Rock magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold between 100 and 120 million units worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Straits\n\nDiscography\nDire Straits (1978)\nCommuniqué (1979)\nMaking Movies (1980)\nLove over Gold (1982)\nBrothers in Arms (1985)\nOn Every Street (1991) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
