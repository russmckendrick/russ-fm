      "biography": "Yes are a British progressive rock band which formed in London, United Kingdom in 1968. They are best known for 1970's \"I've Seen All Good People\", the 1972 9-minute US Top 20 smash \"Roundabout\" and their 1983 #1 hit \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits and the influence of the many changes in popular music, the band has endured for 40 years and still retains a strong international following. Their music is marked by sharp dynamic contrasts, lush harmonies, often extended song lengths and a general showcasing of members' instrumental prowess. Arguably one of the most musically ambitious bands of their genre, Yes manages to use symphonic and other so-called \"classical\" structures with their own blend of musical styles - including some innovations - in a happy constructive \"marriage\" of music.\n\nThe original line-up consisted of Jon Anderson (vocals), Chris Squire (bass, vocals), Peter Banks (guitar, vocals), Tony Kaye (keyboards), and Bill Bruford (drums). Personnel changes brought musicians Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman into the group in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Steve Howe appears on the cover of Time and a Word, even though soon-to-be-ousted Pete Banks is the guitarist on the album. Alan White then replaced Bill Bruford in 1972.  These changes had arguably the biggest influence on their music and subsequent success. The early 1970's saw Yes as one of the few influential mainstream progressive acts.\n\nFor some fans, the double-album, four-track 1973 recording Tales from Topographic Oceans - symphonic and oddly mystical, marked a point of departure. It generally received a critical mauling in the press yet went straight to No. 1 in the UK album charts. Those listeners taken by the Tales album would be enthralled by 1974's Relayer - the only album that Patrick Moraz played keyboards on - which mixed progressive rock and a jazz fusion style that at times was very free in tunes such as \"The Gates of Delirium\". Far from their pop beginnings, this album marked a milestone for the band and for progressive rock as a whole.\n\nDuring the rise of the progressive genre, Yes pioneered the use of synthesizers and sound effects, gaining large popularity with their unique brand of mysticism and grand-scale compositions. Fragile (1971) and Close to the Edge (1972) are considered their best works - symphonic, complex, cerebral, spiritual and moving. These albums featured beautiful harmonies and strong, occasionally heavy playing. Also, Fragile contained the popular hit song \"Roundabout\". With the advent of punk in 1977, many considered progressive rock dead in the water. Yes, however, proved them wrong by releasing one of their most successful albums - Going for the One, which contained \"Awaken\", a rhythmic tour-de-force.\n\nIn 1979, Anderson and Wakeman left the band after unsuccessful recording sessions in Paris.  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (from the new-wave band The Buggles of \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" fame) were recruited to replace them, and the band recorded Drama, their first album without Anderson on vocals.  The resulting sound was much heavier than previous albums, particularly the opening track Machine Messiah, and a strong synth-pop influence due to the involvement of Downes and Horn, which drew some criticism and the dismissive label \"Yuggles\".  While the new Yes was well-received in America, the band encountered more hostile audiences in England.   The group split up in 1981.\n\nThe band reformed in 1983 with a new lineup featuring Squire, White, South African guitarist Trevor Rabin, and the return of Jon Anderson on vocals and Tony Kaye on keyboards.  This line-up, which was eventually nicknamed \"Yes West\", recorded 90125 and Big Generator and enjoyed a resurgence in popularity.  During these years, Yes championed digital sampling technologies and sold millions of records, influencing a generation of digital musicians with hits such as \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" and \"Rhythm of Love\".\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Jon Anderson formed a side project with former Yes members Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Bill Bruford, releasing Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe in 1989.  This led to a merger in 1990 and the album Union and the following tour with all 8 members.  However, while the tour and album were commercial successes, many of the band members were dissatisfied with the album.  Union was comprised of a demo recorded by the \"Yes West\" lineup attached to what was originally recorded as the second Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album, and was finished using session musicians.  Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit.\n\nThe \"Yes West\" lineup went on to release Talk in 1994, but sales were poor, and in 1995 Rabin and Kaye left the band.  Howe and Wakeman re-joined to produce the albums Keys to Ascension in 1996 and Keys to Ascension 2 in 1997, which featured both live performances and new studio tracks, returning to their progressive style of the 1970s.  Wakeman left the band shortly thereafter due to disagreements about the albums and tour.\n\nThe band collaborated with Billy Sherwood to produce the album Open Your Eyes in 1998, and Sherwood became an official member at the end of the sessions due to his significant contributions.  Igor Khoroshev also performed on a few tracks and performed on the following tour, eventually becoming a full member as well.\n\nMoving through the 1990s and into the new millennium, the band has moved back towards progressive influenced music and today keeps pushing the boundaries by using the latest hard-disk recording techniques.\n\nIn 1999 they worked with Relic Entertainment, providing the song \"Homeworld (The Ladder)\" for the PC game Homeworld. Although Sierra Entertainment later released a CD with the soundtrack they, for no apparent reason, chose not to include this song on the CD. It can however be found on the 1999 album The Ladder.\n\nAfter the departure of Sherwood in 2000 and Khoroshev in 2001, Yes recorded Magnification in 2001 without a keyboardist, instead featuring a full orchestra.  Rick Wakeman re-joined the band the next year, and in 2003 the band recorded five tracks that were added as a 3rd CD in the compilation Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversay Collection, including acoustic versions of \"Roundabout\" and \"South Side of the Sky\".\n\nIn 2008, when the band was about to begin their 40th anniversary tour, Jon Anderson suffered from a throat infection and was unable to participate.  Benoit David, from Canadian Progressive Rock band Mystery and Yes tribute band Close To The Edge, was recruited to fill in on vocals for the tour.  In 2009, he was named as Anderson's permanent replacement.  Rick Wakeman's son Oliver Wakeman also joined the band on keyboards.\n\nThe band recorded Fly From Here in 2011, their first new album in 10 years, with David on vocals and Trevor Horn as producer.  Before the album was completed, Wakeman was replaced by Geoff Downes, bringing together the Drama lineup and a similar sound.  The title track was originally conceived in 1981, and it was refined and extended into 20-minute six-part epic.\n\nIn February 2012, after contracting a respiratory illness, David was replaced by Glass Hammer vocalist Jon Davison who, like David, was discovered while fronting a Yes cover band.  In 2014, Yes released Heaven & Earth with Davison performing vocals.\n\nOn May 19, 2015,  Chris Squire announced that he would be unable to join the band on their North American tour with Toto due to being diagnosed with Acute Erythroid Leukemia (AEL), an uncommon form of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Billy Sherwood would perform with the band in his place.\n\nOn June 28, 2015, Yes released the following announcement:\n\nIt’s with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire. Chris peacefully passed away last night (27 June 2015) in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThis is the page for the British progressive rock band Yes.

            "content": "The Yes Album is the third studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, released on 19 February 1971 by Atlantic Records. It was the band's first album to feature guitarist Steve Howe, who replaced Peter Banks in 1970, as well as their last to feature keyboardist Tony Kaye until 1983's 90125.\n\nThe band spent mid-1970 writing and rehearsing new material at a farmhouse at Romansleigh, Devon, and the new songs were recorded at Advision Studios in London in the autumn. The album was the first by the band to feature all-original material. While the album retained close harmony singing, Kaye's Hammond organ, and Chris Squire's melodic bass, as heard on earlier releases, the new material also covered further styles including jazz piano, funk, and acoustic music. All of the band members contributed ideas, and tracks were extended in length to allow music to develop. Howe contributed a variety of guitar styles, including a Spanish laúd, and recorded the solo acoustic guitar piece \"Clap\", live at the Lyceum Theatre, London.\n\nThe album was a critical success and a major commercial breakthrough for Yes, who had been at risk of being dropped by Atlantic due to the commercial failures of their first two albums. It reached number 4 in the United Kingdom and number 40 in the United States, and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for surpassing one million copies. The album has been reissued on CD several times, and was given a Blu-ray release in 2014 remixed by Steven Wilson.\n\nYes had already recorded two albums for Atlantic Records by mid-1970, but neither had been commercially successful and the label was considering dropping them. They had replaced founding member Banks with Howe, who enjoyed playing a wider variety of styles, including folk and country music, and played a mix of electric and acoustic guitars. Singer Jon Anderson later said that Howe could \"jump from one thing to the other, very fast, very talented.\" After some warm-up gigs with Howe, the band moved to Devon to write and rehearse new material. They arrived at a cottage in Churchill, north of Barnstaple, but felt restricted there and were not allowed to make any noise after dark. They advertised in the local paper for a new location, and moved to Langley Farm in Romansleigh, near South Molton, some 20 mi (32 km) away. Howe in particular enjoyed working on the farm, and eventually bought it. Following rehearsals, the band booked Advision Studios in London with producer Eddie Offord and spent the autumn recording. The band enjoyed the sessions, and soon had enough material ready for an album.\n\nSeveral weeks into the Langley Farm rehearsals, manager Roy Flynn came to tell the band he was leaving them and taking money he believed he was owed. This put the band under severe financial stress, leaving concerts as their only source of income at the time. Flynn also owned 5 per cent of the band's publishing revenues in perpetuity; that was later terminated but it left the band bitter enough to retitle a short Bill Bruford instrumental on their next album, Fragile, \"Five Per Cent For Nothing\" in protest. He was soon replaced by Brian Lane.\n\nOn 23 November 1970, the group were involved in a head-on vehicle collision at Basingstoke, while returning from the previous evening's gig at the Plymouth Guildhall. The band all suffered shock, and Kaye's foot was fractured. He had to do the next few gigs, and the album cover's photo shoot, with it in plaster.\n\nHowe mostly used a Gibson ES-175 semi-acoustic guitar and a Martin 00-18 acoustic for recording, though he did attempt to play a variety of styles with the two instruments. Squire played a 1964 Rickenbacker RM1999 bass with Rotosound Swing Bass steel roundwound strings. His amplification was a Marshall 100W tube head with 4x12 cabinets. Kaye's main instruments were the Hammond organ and piano, including a solo on \"A Venture\". Kaye had previously played the Hammond M-100, but for this album used the B-3, a move which he saw as \"a turning point\". He was not interested in playing synthesizers, which had started to appear on the market. This proved to be a problem with the other members of the band, and Kaye thought his style conflicted too much with Howe's. He left the group during rehearsals for the follow-up album in mid-1971, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.\nYes had started their career as a covers band, performing radical re-arrangements of hit songs, and their first two albums included covers in this vein. The Yes Album was the first to feature group-written material in its entirety. Some familiar elements remained: Anderson, Howe and Squire sang three-part vocal harmony throughout the record, while Squire's melodic bass and Bill Bruford's spacious drumming made up their unique rhythm section.\n\n\"Yours Is No Disgrace\" originated from some lyrics written by Anderson with his friend David Foster. This was combined with other short segments of music written by the band in rehearsals. Howe worked out the opening guitar riff on his own while the rest of the band took a day's holiday. The backing track was recorded by the group in sections, then edited together to make up the final piece.\n\nHowe's solo acoustic tune, \"Clap\" (incorrectly titled \"The Clap\" in original album pressings), was influenced by Chet Atkins and Mason Williams' \"Classical Gas\". The piece was written to celebrate the birth of Howe's son Dylan on 4 August 1969. The version that appears on the album was recorded live at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 17 July 1970. The studio take of the piece, which was added as a bonus track on the 2003 Rhino remaster, continues into a section that would return almost unaltered in Howe's next solo acoustic piece \"Mood for a Day\" on their next album, Fragile.\n\nThe spacey, electronic-sounding effect in \"Starship Trooper\" was achieved by running the guitar backing track through a flanger. Anderson wrote the bulk of the song, while Squire wrote the \"Disillusion\" section in the middle. The closing section, \"Würm\" is a continuous cadenza of chords (G-E♭-C) played ad lib. It evolved from a song called \"Nether Street\" by Howe's earlier group, Bodast.\n\"I've Seen All Good People\" is a suite of two tunes. Anderson wanted the piece to start quietly and develop, leading into a large church organ sound, before moving into the funky second movement. The band had difficulty recording the initial \"Your Move\" section, which was resolved by making a tape loop of bass and drums, over which Howe overdubbed a Spanish laúd, miscrediting it as a \"vachalia\" on the album's credits. Gnidrolog's Colin Goldring played recorder on the track. The group also used a Dewtron bass pedal synthesiser on the track, which Anderson would then play in concert.\n\nAnderson wrote \"A Venture\" in the studio; the song was then arranged by the rest of the band. Kaye played piano on the track, contributing a jazzy solo towards the end. Howe played a guitar solo on the original recording, but it was left off the final mix, which faded out just as it started. The song was never played live by the original group, but an arrangement was worked out when Yes decided to play the whole album live in 2013.\n\nAnderson was inspired to write the lyrics for \"Perpetual Change\" by the view of the countryside from the cottage at Churchill. He thought of humans completing the Moon landing at a time when \"our own environment is all fouled up\", and a space mission that involved an explosion on the Moon to observe its thickness and the subsequent Pakistani floods in 1970. \"So I was thinking, ok you knock the moon off its axis and you're going to mess up the world.\" The song's familiar opening chords, Gsus4 and Asus4, are simultaneously played on the guitar and organ. The middle of the track features a polyrhythmic structure, where two pieces of music in different time signatures are playing simultaneously.\n\nThe Yes Album was released in the UK on 19 February 1971. It was a commercial success and was the band's breakthrough album, selling around 60,000 copies upon release and reaching number 4 in the UK. and number 40 in the US. It has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over one million copies.\n\nAt that time British postal workers were on strike, preventing record stores from sending sales reports to Melody Maker, which compiled the charts most followed by the music industry. Richard Branson owned a record store on Oxford Street in London, the first business enterprise in what he later built up into Virgin Group. He began compiling a chart from sales at his store and several others; in the interim the BBC and other media used it. Lane, newly hired as the band's manager, promised them he would get their album in the charts, and did so by buying enough copies of it at the Virgin store to make it the bestselling album there and thus put it high in the charts. By the time the strike had ended, the album had started to sell well due to its initial apparent success. It remained on the charts for 34 weeks, selling over a million copies. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yes/The+Yes+Album\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This was combined with other short segments of music written by the band in rehearsals. Howe worked out the opening guitar riff on his own while the rest of the band took a day's holiday. The backing track was recorded by the group in sections, then edited together to make up the final piece.\n\nHowe's solo acoustic tune, \"Clap\" (incorrectly titled \"The Clap\" in original album pressings), was influenced by Chet Atkins and Mason Williams' \"Classical Gas\". The piece was written to celebrate the birth of Howe's son Dylan on 4 August 1969. The version that appears on the album was recorded live at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 17 July 1970. The studio take of the piece, which was added as a bonus track on the 2003 Rhino remaster, continues into a section that would return almost unaltered in Howe's next solo acoustic piece \"Mood for a Day\" on their next album, Fragile.\n\nThe spacey, electronic-sounding effect in \"Starship Trooper\" was achieved by running the guitar backing track through a flanger. Anderson wrote the bulk of the song, while Squire wrote the \"Disillusion\" section in the middle. The closing section, \"Würm\" is a continuous cadenza of chords (G-E♭-C) played ad lib. It evolved from a song called \"Nether Street\" by Howe's earlier group, Bodast.\n\"I've Seen All Good People\" is a suite of two tunes. Anderson wanted the piece to start quietly and develop, leading into a large church organ sound, before moving into the funky second movement. The band had difficulty recording the initial \"Your Move\" section, which was resolved by making a tape loop of bass and drums, over which Howe overdubbed a Spanish laúd, miscrediting it as a \"vachalia\" on the album's credits. Gnidrolog's Colin Goldring played recorder on the track. The group also used a Dewtron bass pedal synthesiser on the track, which Anderson would then play in concert.\n\nAnderson wrote \"A Venture\" in the studio; the song was then arranged by the rest of the band. Kaye played piano on the track, contributing a jazzy solo towards the end. Howe played a guitar solo on the original recording, but it was left off the final mix, which faded out just as it started. The song was never played live by the original group, but an arrangement was worked out when Yes decided to play the whole album live in 2013.\n\nAnderson was inspired to write the lyrics for \"Perpetual Change\" by the view of the countryside from the cottage at Churchill. He thought of humans completing the Moon landing at a time when \"our own environment is all fouled up\", and a space mission that involved an explosion on the Moon to observe its thickness and the subsequent Pakistani floods in 1970. \"So I was thinking, ok you knock the moon off its axis and you're going to mess up the world.\" The song's familiar opening chords, Gsus4 and Asus4, are simultaneously played on the guitar and organ. The middle of the track features a polyrhythmic structure, where two pieces of music in different time signatures are playing simultaneously.\n\nThe Yes Album was released in the UK on 19 February 1971. It was a commercial success and was the band's breakthrough album, selling around 60,000 copies upon release and reaching number 4 in the UK. and number 40 in the US. It has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over one million copies.\n\nAt that time British postal workers were on strike, preventing record stores from sending sales reports to Melody Maker, which compiled the charts most followed by the music industry. Richard Branson owned a record store on Oxford Street in London, the first business enterprise in what he later built up into Virgin Group. He began compiling a chart from sales at his store and several others; in the interim the BBC and other media used it. Lane, newly hired as the band's manager, promised them he would get their album in the charts, and did so by buying enough copies of it at the Virgin store to make it the bestselling album there and thus put it high in the charts. By the time the strike had ended, the album had started to sell well due to its initial apparent success. It remained on the charts for 34 weeks, selling over a million copies. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yes/The+Yes+Album\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_summary": "The Yes Album is the third studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, released on 19 February 1971 by Atlantic Records. It was the band's first album to feature guitarist Steve Howe, who replaced Peter Banks in 1970, as well as their last to feature keyboardist Tony Kaye until 1983's 90125. The band spent mid-1970 writing and rehearsing new material at a farmhouse at Romansleigh, Devon, and the new songs were recorded at Advision Studios in London in the autumn. The album was the first by the band to feature all-original material. While the album retained close harmony singing, <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yes/The+Yes+Album\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
