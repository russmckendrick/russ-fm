      "biography": "Radiohead are an English alternative rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993; their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead\n\nStudio albums\nPablo Honey (1993)\nThe Bends (1995)\nOK Computer (1997)\nKid A (2000)\nAmnesiac (2001)\nHail to the Thief (2003)\nIn Rainbows (2007)\nThe King of Limbs (2011)\nA Moon Shaped Pool (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "During the run-up to the release of Radiohead’s 2000 electronic opus <i>Kid A</i>, the band members often spoke about breaking up. It was, in part, a hypothetical consideration, one that preceded the album’s recording sessions: If the group’s heralded 1997 release <i>OK Computer</i> was such a masterpiece, why bother trying to top it? But it was also an acknowledgement of the intra-band tension involved in the making of <i>Kid A</i>. That album—which found Radiohead pushing past their guitar-rock sound—had led to shouting matches and tirades, power plays and pity parties. Could the bandmates actually endure making a follow-up?\n\nBut as Radiohead toured in support of <i>Kid A</i>—which at one point had been conceived as a double album—the members began listening to the dozens of songs and sketches that didn’t make the cut the first time around. Which is why, just seven months after <i>Kid A</i>’s release, Radiohead returned with 2001’s <i>Amnesiac</i>—an album Thom Yorke described as “our secret weapon against all the weirdness going on.” It was a surprisingly cohesive companion that at once felt more esoteric and accessible than its predecessor. And <i>Amnesiac</i> proved that the electronic explorations and the fragmented lyrical codex of <i>Kid A</i> weren’t a fluke: This was now Radiohead, at a new vanguard of rock.\n\nInformed by Charles Mingus, “Pyramid Song” is one of the prettiest songs in Radiohead’s catalogue, its meaty piano chords and ominous electronic tide lifting Yorke’s falsetto croon. And though it’s a polemic against Tony Blair and politicians like him, “You and Whose Army?” is an exquisite drift, anchored by Colin Greenwood’s perfect bassline. “Life in a Glasshouse”, meanwhile, unfurls over the jazz-band sighs of British trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton. It’s a song you could slip into a family holiday playlist—so long as the volume remained low enough to hide its little symphony of dissonance.\n\n<i>Amnesiac</i> also proved just how far the group had ventured into electronics and abstraction. The askance percussion samples of “Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box” dart around its dance-floor rhythm like a tease, with Yorke riding the beat with stunning R&B aplomb. And the band wanders into electro-acoustic territory for “Hunting Bears”, which features a pensive spaghetti-western guitar slowly sinking into itself. Meanwhile, “Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors” remains one of the most aggressive Radiohead cuts, its mix of battering-ram arrhythmia, prepared piano strikes and static loops clawing at Yorke’s warped voice like the track is an existential battle for space. What <i>Amnesiac</i> lacks in clear narrative it makes up for in breadth—and in its ability to suggest the many directions in which Radiohead might still move.",
