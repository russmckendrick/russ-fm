      "biography": "Mott the Hoople were a British rock band with strong R&B roots, popular in the glam rock era of the early to mid 1970s. They are popularly known for the song \"All the Young Dudes\", written for them by David Bowie and appearing on their 1972 album of the same name.\n\nMott the Hoople can be traced to two beat bands from Herefordshire in the early 1960s. The Soulents were from Ross-On-Wye, and boasted Pete Overend Watts on guitar, and Dale \"Buffin\" Griffin on drums. The Buddies were from Hereford, and featured Mick Ralphs on guitar and Stan Tippins on vocals. By 1966, Ralphs, Tippins, and Watts (the latter now on bass) had come together in a band called The Doc Thomas Group, and soon secured a residency at a club in a resort town in Italy. The group were offered a recording contract with the Italian label Dischi Interrecord, and released an eponymous album in January 1967. By 1968, drummer Dale Griffin and organist Verden Allen had joined the band.\n\nAlthough the group toured and recorded in Italy as The Doc Thomas Group, their gigs in the UK were played under the names of The Shakedown Sound, and later as Silence. Silence recorded demos at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales, which were shopped to EMI, Polydor, Immediate and Apple with no success. The group came to the attention of Guy Stevens at Island, who liked the group but not with Tippins as lead singer. Advertisements were placed (\"Singer wanted, must be image-minded and hungry\"), and Ian Hunter was selected as lead singer and piano player. Tippins assumed the role of road manager.\n\nStevens read the Willard Manus novel Mott the Hoople about an eccentric who works in a circus freak show while in prison, and determined to use it as a band name. Silence reluctantly agreed to a name change following their early 1969 audition for Stevens.\n\nThe band's debut album, Mott the Hoople (1969), which was recorded in a week, was a cult success, and their repertoire included cover versions of \"Laugh at Me\" (Sonny Bono) and \"At the Crossroads\" (Doug Sahm's Sir Douglas Quintet), and an instrumental cover of \"You Really Got Me\" (The Kinks).\n\nThe second album, Mad Shadows (1970) sold poorly and received generally negative reviews. Wildlife (1971) fared even worse, and flirted with an overtly country-hippie stance and accordingly (usually) acoustic instrumentation. On 10 October 1970, Mott the Hoople and Bridget St John were showcased on BBC Two's, Disco 2. Even though the group was building a decent following, Brain Capers (1971) failed to sell well. The group decided to split following a depressing concert in a disused gas holder in Switzerland. When combined with an aborted UK tour with The Lothringers, the band was close to breaking up.\n\nDavid Bowie had long been a fan of the band, and heard from Watts that they were about to split. He persuaded them to stay together and offered them \"Suffragette City\" from his then yet-to-be-released Ziggy Stardust album. They turned it down. Bowie also penned \"All the Young Dudes\" for them, and it became their biggest hit. Released as a single in July 1972, it was a success in the UK, with the band using Tippins - who by this time was their tour manager - to sing backing vocals during concert. Bowie produced an album, also called All the Young Dudes, which included a Mick Ronson strings and brass arrangement for \"Sea Diver\", sold well but stalled at No. 21 in the UK Albums Chart. Late in 1972 they were going to record another Bowie song, \"Drive-In Saturday\", but their intended arrangement did not satisfy him and their professional relationship effectively ended. Another casualty in the wake of All the Young Dudes was Verden Allen, who departed before the release of their next album, Mott.\n\nMott climbed into the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart, and became the band's best seller to date in the US. It yielded two UK hits, \"Honaloochie Boogie\" and \"All the Way from Memphis\", both featuring Andy Mackay of Roxy Music on saxophone. \"All the Way From Memphis\" is also featured in the movie, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\n\nMott the Hoople's new found popularity ultimately helped lead to the band's break-up, perhaps helped along by an exposé in New Musical Express of Tippins' role in singing the chorus of \"All the Young Dudes\", from a hidden microphone backstage. In May 1973 following Verden Allen's departure the band was augmented by two keyboard players. Former Love Affair and Morgan member Morgan Fisher joined as keyboardist and Mick Bolton joined on Hammond Organ. Bolton left at the end of 1973 and was replaced on tour by Blue Weaver, while Fisher stayed on to become their permanent piano player. Ralphs left in August 1973 to form Bad Company and was replaced by former Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor. For contractual reasons, he changed his name to Ariel Bender at the suggestion of singer-songwriter Lynsey De Paul for his stint with the band.\n\nIn the afterglow of The Hoople (1974), a live album Live was quickly released, after which Mick Ronson replaced Bender. The end was nigh when both Ronson and Hunter left the group to form a duo. Ray Major and Nigel Benjamin were added to continue the group, which abbreviated its name to 'Mott'.\n\nIn 1974, Mott the Hoople toured America with Ariel Bender playing lead guitar. In one of Bender's earliest performances with the band they played the Masonic Temple in Detroit on October 12, 1973 with a young Aerosmith opening the show. They were primarily supported on the '74 tour by the band Queen. This tour later provided the inspiration for Queen's 1975 single \"Now I'm Here\", which contains the lyrics \"Down in the city, just Hoople and me.\" The song became a live favourite of Queen fans and reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart. The tour resulted in a lifelong friendship between the two bands, with Ian Hunter, Mick Ronson and David Bowie performing \"All the Young Dudes\" at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992. Morgan Fisher went on to play piano on Queen's 'Hot Space' tour in 1982, and Brian May, Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor performed backing vocals on the Ian Hunter solo song, \"You Nearly Did Me In\". May would later cover Mott's \"All the Way from Memphis\" on his solo album, Another World, with Hunter making a guest appearance.",
