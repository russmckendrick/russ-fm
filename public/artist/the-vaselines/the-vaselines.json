  "biography": "The Vaselines is an indie pop band from Glasgow, Scotland. Formed in 1986, the band was originally made up of only vocalists/guitarists Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, but later added James Seenan and Eugene's brother Charlie Kelly on bass and drums respectively from the band Secession. McKee had formerly been a member of a band named The Pretty Flowers with Duglas T. Stewart (later of BMX Bandits), Norman Blake (later of Teenage Fanclub) and Sean Dickson (later of The Soup Dragons). Eugene had formerly played in The Famous Monsters.\n\nNirvana frontman Kurt Cobain once described Kelly and McKee as his \"most favorite songwriters in the whole world\".\n\nThe band released two singles, \"Son of a Gun\" and \"Dying for It\", prior to releasing an album. In 1989 they released their only album, Dum Dum, on the record label Rough Trade. Following the closing of the record label 53rd and 3rd, which they had originally signed to, the band broke up in 1990. However, they reunited later that year to open for Nirvana when they played in Edinburgh.\n\nThough they were not widely known when the band existed, covers of their songs by Nirvana and Kurt Cobain's tendency to mention them as an influence brought exposure to the band. With their songs \"Son of a Gun\" and \"Molly's Lips\" covered on Nirvana's album Incesticide and \"Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam\" covered as \"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam\" on MTV Unplugged in New York, the band gained a new audience from people who wanted to discover the bands that influenced Cobain (a similar situation happened to the band The Meat Puppets). Due to this new exposure, in 1992 Sub Pop released The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History, a compilation that contained The Vaselines' entire body of work on one album.\n\nNo longer together, members of the band moved on to new bands. Kelly went on to found the band Captain America (later renamed Eugenius). He currently performs solo. McKee founded the band Suckle and released her first solo album, Sunny Moon, in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the band reformed and began to make sporadic appearences at festivals in the United Kingdom and the United States and various tours supporting Belle and Sebastian. The band will perform at the Belle and Sebastian's second Bowlie Weekender festival in December 2010.\n\nIn 2010, the band announced they would release their second album \"Sex With An X\" on September 14, 2010 on Sub Pop Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Soon signing to Pastels frontman Stephan Pastel's newly formed 53rd and 3rd label, the Vaselines' first-ever studio session yielded their debut single, 1987's \"Son of a Gun.\" The follow-up, \"Dying for It,\" appeared a year later, with the inclusion of viola player Sophie Pragnell plainly acknowledging the band's debt to the Velvet Underground. The demise of 53rd and 3rd proved fatal to the Vaselines as well, however, and the group dissolved the same week their lone studio LP, 1989's Dum Dum, was released via Rough Trade, although the following year the original lineup briefly reunited to open for Nirvana in Edinburgh. Nirvana would go on to cover the Vaselines' \"Molly's Lips\" and \"Son of a Gun\" (both later compiled on their Incesticide collection) as well as performing \"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam\" on their now-legendary MTV Unplugged appearance. Renewed interest in the band resulted in the 1992 Sub Pop release of The Way of the Vaselines, an assemblage of all 19 of their official recordings. Eugene Kelly later went on to front Captain America (subsequently and rather unfortunately renamed Eugenius), while McKee spent the better part of the decade out of sight before finally resurfacing in Suckle. \r\n(Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide)\r\n",

        "profile": "The group was formed in Edinburgh in 1987 by singers/guitarists Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, who were later joined by Kelly's brother Charles on drums and James Seenan on bass. Soon signing to Pastels frontman Stephan Pastel's newly formed 53rd and 3rd label, the Vaselines' first-ever studio session yielded their debut single, 1987's \"Son of a Gun.\" The follow-up, \"Dying for It,\" appeared a year later, with the inclusion of viola player Sophie Pragnell plainly acknowledging the band's debt to the Velvet Underground. The demise of 53rd and 3rd proved fatal to the Vaselines as well, however, and the group dissolved the same week their lone studio LP, 1989's Dum Dum, was released via Rough Trade, although the following year the original lineup briefly reunited to open for Nirvana in Edinburgh. Nirvana would go on to cover the Vaselines' \"Molly's Lips\" and \"Son of a Gun\" (both later compiled on their Incesticide collection) as well as performing \"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam\" on their now-legendary MTV Unplugged appearance. Renewed interest in the band resulted in the 1992 Sub Pop release of The Way of the Vaselines, an assemblage of all 19 of their official recordings. Eugene Kelly later went on to front Captain America (subsequently and rather unfortunately renamed Eugenius), while McKee spent the better part of the decade out of sight before finally resurfacing in Suckle. \r\n(Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide)\r\n",

      "bio_content": "The Vaselines is an indie pop band from Glasgow, Scotland. Formed in 1986, the band was originally made up of only vocalists/guitarists Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, but later added James Seenan and Eugene's brother Charlie Kelly on bass and drums respectively from the band Secession. McKee had formerly been a member of a band named The Pretty Flowers with Duglas T. Stewart (later of BMX Bandits), Norman Blake (later of Teenage Fanclub) and Sean Dickson (later of The Soup Dragons). Eugene had formerly played in The Famous Monsters.\n\nNirvana frontman Kurt Cobain once described Kelly and McKee as his \"most favorite songwriters in the whole world\".\n\nThe band released two singles, \"Son of a Gun\" and \"Dying for It\", prior to releasing an album. In 1989 they released their only album, Dum Dum, on the record label Rough Trade. Following the closing of the record label 53rd and 3rd, which they had originally signed to, the band broke up in 1990. However, they reunited later that year to open for Nirvana when they played in Edinburgh.\n\nThough they were not widely known when the band existed, covers of their songs by Nirvana and Kurt Cobain's tendency to mention them as an influence brought exposure to the band. With their songs \"Son of a Gun\" and \"Molly's Lips\" covered on Nirvana's album Incesticide and \"Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam\" covered as \"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam\" on MTV Unplugged in New York, the band gained a new audience from people who wanted to discover the bands that influenced Cobain (a similar situation happened to the band The Meat Puppets). Due to this new exposure, in 1992 Sub Pop released The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History, a compilation that contained The Vaselines' entire body of work on one album.\n\nNo longer together, members of the band moved on to new bands. Kelly went on to found the band Captain America (later renamed Eugenius). He currently performs solo. McKee founded the band Suckle and released her first solo album, Sunny Moon, in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the band reformed and began to make sporadic appearences at festivals in the United Kingdom and the United States and various tours supporting Belle and Sebastian. The band will perform at the Belle and Sebastian's second Bowlie Weekender festival in December 2010.\n\nIn 2010, the band announced they would release their second album \"Sex With An X\" on September 14, 2010 on Sub Pop Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Vaselines\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
