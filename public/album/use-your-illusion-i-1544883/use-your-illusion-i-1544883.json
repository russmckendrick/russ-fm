      "biography": "Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardist Dizzy Reed, guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardist Chris Pitman. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all time.\nGuns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), reached number one on the Billboard 200 a year after its release, on the strength of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", the group's only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached number two on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan. After more than a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016.\nGuns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and glam metal. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which they brought forth a \"hedonistic rebelliousness\" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned them the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world\". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, in its first year of eligibility.",

      "editorial_notes": "A few months after the release of Guns N’ Roses’ debut album, 1987’s <i>Appetite for Destruction</i>, went platinum, Axl Rose gave an interview in which he described a piano ballad he’d been working on called “November Rain”. By that point, the band knew it well: They’d recorded a demo of it nearly a year before starting <i>Appetite</i>, and their guitarist, Slash, remembers an even earlier version that had expanded to 18 minutes. The song seemed to torture Rose—or, at least, represented an ideal he was obsessed with bringing to life. If he didn’t get it right, he told the interviewer, he’d quit music.<br />\nThe best comparison for 1991’s <i>Use Your Illusion I</i> and its fraternal twin, <i>Use Your Illusion II</i>, isn’t music, but film. The budget, the combined two-hour runtime, the scale, the fact that the band were almost never in the same room at the same time: This isn’t music captured, but music built—piece by audacious piece. Riki Rachtman, a former MTV personality and friend of the band, joked that the moment he knew they’d changed for good was during the last sequence of the video for “Estranged”, in which Axl not only jumps off an aircraft carrier into the ocean, but follows it with a sequence of him swimming with dolphins.<br />\nThis, though, is where Rose’s head was at, and what <i>Use Your Illusion</i> represents: not the spontaneity of bar bands, but the methodical grandeur of blockbusters. The climactic held vocal note of “Don’t Cry”—nearly 30 seconds, twisting in the spotlight—confirms what some listeners probably already figured out: Rose dreamed of opera. He later said he didn’t just want to outdo their debut, but bury it. And in a way, <i>Use Your Illusion</i> is an even scarier effort: tender one minute (“November Rain”, “Dead Horse”) and cruel the next (“Back Off Bitch”, “Bad Obsession”), an exercise in emotional whiplash that verges on the psychopathic.<br />\nBut even by the band’s own standards, it was vicious: Where <i>Appetite</i> talks about addiction with a sense of swagger or double entendre (“Nightrain”, “Mr. Brownstone”), <i>Use Your Illusion</i> offers a 10-minute death fantasy called “Coma”; where <i>Appetite</i> is “feel my serpentine” (“Welcome to the Jungle”), <i>Use Your Illusion</i> is “suck my fucking dick” (“Get in the Ring”). Of the two volumes, the second is weirder and more adventurous. Slash once compared the entire project to The Beatles’ White Album (only not as good, he genuflected), but the experience is more like The Rolling Stones’ <i>Exile on Main St.</i>: sprawling, dislocated, less about any single song than the rollercoaster-like effect of the larger picture. And as massive as its impact was on the shape of ’90s rock, there are elements of the albums—and <i>II</i>, especially—that resonate even more closely with gangsta rap: the cinematic scope (“Civil War”), the mix of nostalgia and sentimentality (“Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door”) with almost paranoiac meanness (“You Could Be Mine”).<br />\nBoth of its volumes seeing release on the same day, <i>Use Your Illusion</i> came out at a time when a wave of underground bands was redefining mainstream rock by trading grandiosity for modesty. But 1991 also marked the death of Freddie Mercury and, by extension, the end of Queen as we often remember them. The coincidence is poetic: As Nirvana and their peers largely eschewed rock’s taste for spectacle, G N' R embodied it. Like a fading starlet leaning into a nervous breakdown, Axl preens for the camera, knowing it won’t look away.",

And as massive as its impact was on the shape of ’90s rock, there are elements of the albums—and <i>II</i>, especially—that resonate even more closely with gangsta rap: the cinematic scope (“Civil War”), the mix of nostalgia and sentimentality (“Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door”) with almost paranoiac meanness (“You Could Be Mine”).<br />\nBoth of its volumes seeing release on the same day, <i>Use Your Illusion</i> came out at a time when a wave of underground bands was redefining mainstream rock by trading grandiosity for modesty. But 1991 also marked the death of Freddie Mercury and, by extension, the end of Queen as we often remember them. The coincidence is poetic: As Nirvana and their peers largely eschewed rock’s taste for spectacle, G N' R embodied it. Like a fading starlet leaning into a nervous breakdown, Axl preens for the camera, knowing it won’t look away."

            "content": "Use Your Illusion I is the 3rd studio album by hard rock band Guns N' Roses. It was the one of two albums released in conjunction with the Use Your Illusion Tour, the other named Use Your Illusion II, thus they are sometimes seen together as a double album. The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard charts behind Use Your Illusion II. Each of the Use Your Illusion albums have been certified 7x platinum. Spader Music Magazine listed the album in one of its greatest albums column.\n\nThe Use Your Illusion albums represent a turning point in the sound of Guns N' Roses. Although they did not abandon the hard rock tendencies vivid in their first album, Appetite for Destruction, Use Your Illusion I demonstrated, for the first time, more or less, elements of blues, classical music, and country. For example, lead singer Axl Rose plays the piano on several tracks of both albums. In addition, with the Use Your Illusion Tour, both the music and stage presence of the band became more theatrical, in the tradition of progressive rock. This fact is evidenced by the numerous music videos produced in conjunction with these albums. Use Your Illusion I contains two of the three songs, \"November Rain\" and \"Don't Cry (Original)\" whose videos are generally held by fans to be part of a trilogy. The third song, \"Estranged\", is on Use Your Illusion II.\n\nA number of songs on the album were written in the band's early days, but were not included on Appetite for Destruction but can be found on the popular bootlegged so-called \"Rumbo Tapes\", an album of early demo tapes. \"Back Off Bitch\", \"Bad Obsession\", \"Don't Cry\" (referred to by Rose during the ensuing tour as 'the first song  ever wrote together'), \"November Rain\", and \"The Garden\" are considered part of this group. There is also a cover of \"Live and Let Die\".\n\nBesides stylistic differences, another new aspect seen in Use Your Illusion I was longer songs. \"November Rain\", an epic ballad, is nearly 9 minutes long, and \"Coma\" is more than 10 minutes long. Another change was the presence of tracks sung by other members of the band (even though certain songs from Appetite for Destruction and G N' R Lies featured other members on duet vocals): lead vocals on \"Dust N' Bones\", \"You Ain't The First\" and \"Double Talkin' Jive\" are performed by rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin (on Use Your Illusion II, Stradlin sings \"14 Years\" and bassist Duff McKagan sings \"So Fine\").\n\nTo achieve the final sound of the album, the band had some difficulty, especially during the mixing stages of the production of both albums. According to a 1991 cover story by Rolling Stone magazine, after mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain, the band decided to scrap the mixes and start from scratch with engineer Bill Price of Sex Pistols fame.\n\nSlash has stated that most of the material for the album was written on acoustics in a couple of nights at his house (the Walnut House), after several months of non-productivity. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses/Use+Your+Illusion+I\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
