  "biography": "The Fierce & The Dead is the brainchild of Matt Stevens (guitars) Kev Feazey (bass) and Stuart Marshall (drums), a trio of friends who have been playing together for more than ten years, helping each other in different bands, and also as solo artists. This project actually was created after a recording session which was intended to be part of a Matt Stevens' solo album, but they decided to create a new band with an own style and sound.\n\nIn 2010 they released a 19-minute EP entitled Part 1, and in May of this 2011 their first full-lenght album called If It Carries On Like This We Are Moving To Morecambe saw the light. Both have received good critics from press and fans, which have encouraged the band to continue with this positive path. \nWhat we will find in The Fierce & The Dead is a wonderful mixture or post-rock, atmospheric sounds and overwhelming guitars which share beautiful and calm moments, with explosive changes, heavier sounds that all of a sudden appear, and that will accelerate your emotions.\n\nThis is not the typical post-rock band, they have managed to create an own sound, diverse, original and promising. Recommendable for all the fans of the genre, and also for the progressive rock fan. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Fierce+&+The+Dead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
