      "biography": "Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer-songwriter, musician and humanitarian activist who rose to fame as the original lead singer and flautist of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, Gabriel went on to a successful solo career, with \"Solsbury Hill\" his first single. His 1986 album, So, is his most commercially successful, and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the U.S. The album's biggest hit, \"Sledgehammer\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, and it remains the most played music video in the history of MTV.\nGabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has also pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \"Biko\". He has participated in several human rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the WITNESS human rights organisation in 1992. Gabriel developed The Elders with Richard Branson, which was launched by Nelson Mandela in 2007.\nGabriel has won three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male in 1987, six Grammy Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was made a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his \"influence on generations of music makers\". In recognition of his many years of human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, and TIME magazine named Gabriel one of the 100 most influential people in the world. AllMusic has described Gabriel as \"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, followed by his induction as a solo artist in 2014.",

      "editorial_notes": "Exploring his love of R&B and soul music for the first time, Peter Gabriel reinvented himself on 1986’s <i>So</i>, his fifth album. It’s the album that transformed the once shadowy, sinister, secretive art-rocker—by now in his mid-thirties—into an unlikely pop sensation. For the first time, Gabriel’s songs were stripped of their layers of sonic trickery and cubist textures, while producer Daniel Lanois coaxed the singer into finally letting his drummers use cymbals and hi-hats again. And, for the first time, Gabriel’s face even appeared unobscured on the album cover. The resulting album would go platinum five times over, turn Gabriel into an MTV fixture and grant the singer a unique burst of total pop dominance—one that was never experienced at this level by fellow travellers like David Bowie, David Byrne, Bryan Ferry or even post-Police Sting.\n\nThe album’s lead single, recorded almost as an afterthought, was “Sledgehammer”, an avant-garde R&B throwback powered by big synths and even bigger horns. A chart-topping hit in the US, “Sledgehammer” moves along via a one-take recording of drummer Manu Katché’s incredible groove (he’s been a staple of Gabriel’s band ever since). Similarly, the combustible funk-rock of “Big Time” features a big beat from Police drummer Stewart Copeland, as well as veteran Gabriel drummer Jerry Marotta tapping on Tony Levin’s bass with drumsticks.\n\nThe success of “Sledgehammer” served as a gateway to the rest of <i>So</i>, exposing millions to Gabriel’s sui generis world of arresting ballads, vaporous atmospheres and omnivorous appetite for global rhythms. Though absolutely drenched in synthesisers, “Don’t Give Up” is something of Gabriel’s attempt at Americana, taking inspiration by Depression-era photographs. He originally sought Dolly Parton for the duet, but ultimately tapped Kate Bush, who supplies one of the album’s most intimate and chilling performances. The slowed-down Brazilian forró rhythms of “Mercy Street” floats like a fog, while “In Your Eyes” features the gymnastic, ecstatic voice of Senegalese mbalax superstar Youssou N’Dour, along with Katché’s absolutely wild drum fills.\n\n<i>So</i> was nothing short of a sensation, staying on the US album charts for an astonishing 93 weeks. Gabriel ended up nominated for four Grammys, three American Music Awards, and eleven MTV Video Music Awards—and the wildly ambitious video for “Sledgehammer” is regarded as a peak moment of the entire art form of music video itself. <i>So</i> would become even deeper engrained into the cultural firmament after John Cusack threw a boombox over his head to play “In Your Eyes” in the 1989 film <i>Say Anything</i>.",

            "content": "So is the fifth studio album (and seventh album overall) by British rock musician Peter Gabriel, released in 1986. Many of its songs reflect a more conventional pop-writing style and became radio hits, others still retain Gabriel's dark, brooding sense of experimentalism.\n\nIt is Peter Gabriel's second album produced by Canadian artist Daniel Lanois. The previous year, the two of them had worked together on Birdy. Lanois had been previously known for his ambient collaborations with Brian Eno as well as producing U2 since 1984. As he had with the soundtrack to the film Birdy, Lanois brought many of his own ambient sensibilities to this recording.\n\nThe album begins with an emotionally charged piece titled \"Red Rain\". Inspired by a recurring dream which Gabriel had of swimming in a sea of red water, its lyrics vividly depict dream imagery that reflect a sense of vulnerability. The song is one of the works in the story of Mozo, a wandering stranger who appears in several Gabriel songs. Of all the tracks on the album, Gabriel considers \"Red Rain\" one of his favourites. Other Mozo works include \"On the Air\" and \"Exposure\".\n\nThe second track is Peter Gabriel's most popular single, \"Sledgehammer\". \"Sledgehammer\" is an upbeat piece with strong Motown influences, and a world music touch from its famous use of the shakuhachi. This song also shows Tony Levin's abilities on the bass. The video for \"Sledgehammer\" won MTV's 1987 Top Music Video Award. Directed by Steven Johnson, it features stop motion animation by Aardman Animations of Wallace and Gromit fame. The dancing chickens were animated by Nick Park. The video ends with Gabriel dancing in silhouette, covered with lights taped on his suit by a runner who later became a producer for the Wallace and Gromit films. While performing \"Sledgehammer\" on his 2002 tour, Gabriel recreated this image by wearing a jacket covered with LED lights.\n\nTracks 3–6 cover more serious emotional content. These tracks include a duet with Kate Bush titled \"Don't Give Up,\" \"That Voice Again,\" and hit single \"In Your Eyes\". \"Mercy Street\" is dedicated to poet Anne Sexton and takes its title from her 1969 play, Mercy Street (Sexton also posthumously released a book of poetry, 45 Mercy Street).\n\nTrack 7 is the album's last upbeat pop piece, \"Big Time\". This song is a send-up of the narcissism of the 1980s. It was also accompanied by a video in the vein of \"Sledgehammer\", although to less popularity.\n\nThen comes the album's darkest and most experimental track titled \"We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)\". The title refers to the 37 out of 40 compliant subjects of Milgram Experiment 18.\n\nThe album ends with a pictorial and meditative piece titled \"This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)\". This song features vocals with co-writer Laurie Anderson. This track is not included on the original vinyl release of the album, but was added to the audio cassette and CD editions. Anderson had previously recorded a different arrangement of the song entitled \"Excellent Birds\" for her 1984 album, Mister Heartbreak, which also featured vocals by Gabriel. A video rendition of the song featuring Anderson and Gabriel was included in the 1 January 1984 TV satellite broadcast Good Morning, Mr. Orwell. Anderson also performs the song in her concert film Home of the Brave, released around the same time as So.\n\nThis was Gabriel's first studio album to bear an official title from its inception. His previous regular albums were simply titled \"Peter Gabriel,\" including 1982's Security, which was retitled by Gabriel's US label at the time, Geffen Records. It had been speculated that the album was named for the fifth note on the scale(do-re-mi-fa-SO), signifying that it was Gabriel's fifth solo album. However, the fifth note of the scale is actually SOL, and according to Peter Gabriel himself, the title did not have any meaning. \"It doesn't mean anything\", he said in an interview with Smash Hits in 1986. \"We just liked the form of the word and the two letters. That's all.\"\n\nWhen the album was remastered in 2002 with most of Gabriel's catalogue, the song \"In Your Eyes\" was moved from the fifth song to the ninth song. This was what Peter Gabriel originally intended, but because of the limitations of the vinyl release format it was moved up to be the first track on side two. Oddly, the credits in the booklet were not changed to show the change in order (so, Youssou N'Dour, instead of being credited with backing vocals to \"In Your Eyes\" is given credit for backing vocals on \"Mercy Street\").\n\nWe Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37) was featured in an episode of the T.V series Miami Vice.\n\nIn 1998, Q magazine readers voted So the 81st greatest album of all time. In 2001, the TV network VH1 placed it at number 91. Rolling Stone magazine places the album at 187 on its list of 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel/So\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
