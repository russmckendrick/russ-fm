Born in Dorset, England, Harvey first gained widespread acclaim in the early 1990s with her debut album \"Dry,\" establishing herself as a powerful voice in the music scene. Over the years, her work has earned her multiple awards, including the Mercury Prize for her albums \"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\" and \"Let England Shake.\"\n\nIn 2023, Harvey released her 10th studio album, \"I Inside the Old Year Dying,\" a work deeply inspired by her epic poem Orlam. The album explores themes of first love, loss, and the search for meaning, showcasing her continuous evolution as an artist. Produced by longtime collaborators Flood and John Parish, the album features tracks like \"A Child’s Question, August\" and \"Seem an I,\" blending haunting melodies with introspective lyrics.\n\nAlongside her music career, Harvey has explored various creative avenues. She has worked on soundtracks, poetry, and even collaborated on theatrical projects, demonstrating her versatility as an artist. Harvey's ability to seamlessly navigate between different forms of expression has solidified her status as a multifaceted creator.",

      "editorial_notes": "After releasing two savage instant-classic LPs as a trio with drummer Rob Ellis and bassist Steve Vaughan as PJ Harvey, Polly Jean Harvey blew up her band but got to keep the name. When it was released in February 1995, <i>To Bring You My Love</i> felt like a tectonic shift—in scope, in sonics, in stakes—as the bare-bones minimalism of 1992’s <i>Dry</i> and 1993’s <i>Rid of Me</i> gave way to something bolder and more dramatic. Harvey took on U2’s producer (Flood), their management and at least some of their ambition, trading grungy (as opposed to grunge-y) aesthetics for gowns and theatricality. But viewed from a distance, the album feels more of a piece with its predecessors than nearly anything that would come in her career subsequently. It’s a perfect fulcrum in a rich discography: Her presence is still feral, but tempered by the more nuanced textures and moods that she would come to explore further and eventually define herself by. The album’s key personnel—chiefly, her one-time bandmate John Parish and the Bad Seeds’ Mick Harvey—would become her most frequent and important collaborators over the ensuing decades, and <i>To Bring You My Love</i> reads like a road map of where they would later go.<br />\nThe opening title track sets the swampy, unsettling mood—a dark religious revival that channels the blues without mimicking it, forging a connection between American traditionalism and gothic English horror (see: the whispered, cursed incantation closing out “Down by the Water”—“Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water/Come back here, man, give me my daughter”). “Long Snake Moan” and “Meet Ze Monsta” channel the ferociousness Harvey built her reputation on, while “Working for the Man” and, particularly, closing track “The Dancer” point Harvey forward, exploring the power in relative restraint, of withholding in all the spots where she used to deploy exorcism.",

            "content": "\"To Bring You My Love\" is the third studio album by the English alternative rock musician PJ Harvey, released on 27 February 1995 by Island Records. Recorded after the break-up of the PJ Harvey trio, it stands as her first proper solo album. The songs on the album are heavily influenced by American blues music.\n\nHarvey co-produced the record with Flood and John Parish. \"To Bring You My Love\" would be the first of Harvey's many collaborations with Flood and Parish. The music on the album was played largely by Harvey and Parish, with contributions from seasoned musicians Joe Gore, Mick Harvey, Jean-Marc Butty, and others. Many of the musicians who appeared on the album joined Harvey on tour to support it in 1995.\n\n\"To Bring You My Love\" is considered to be PJ Harvey's breakthrough. It garnered massive critical acclaim worldwide and became her best-selling studio album. The single \"Down by the Water\" received extensive airplay on radio and on MTV. The album was placed on Rolling Stone magazine's original list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nBackground and history\nPJ Harvey took a break from the spotlight in 1994. After releasing two studio albums (Dry and Rid of Me) and a compilation (4-Track Demos) in less than two years, she kept a low profile for most of the year. Harvey made only one public appearance in 1994, performing a cover version of the Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" with Icelandic singer Björk at the annual BRIT Awards.\n\nUsing the royalties that she had received from her first two studio albums, she bought a house in rural England close to her parents' home in Yeovil. She described her new home as \"completely in the countryside. I have no neighbours. When I look out the window, all I see are fields.\" Living in near isolation, she began writing the songs that would appear on \"To Bring You My Love\".\n\nRecording\n\"To Bring You My Love\" was Harvey's first album of new material since disbanding the original PJ Harvey trio in 1993. For this recording she recruited producer Flood, her old Automatic Dlamini bandmate John Parish and a new line-up of session musicians including multi-instrumentalists Joe Gore, Eric Drew Feldman, Mick Harvey and drummer Jean-Marc Butty. She herself played guitar, keyboards, vibraphone and bells on the record, as well as co-producing it with Flood and John Parish. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey/To+Bring+You+My+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
