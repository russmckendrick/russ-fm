  "biography": "The Wildhearts is an English rock band, formed in 1989 in Newcastle upon Tyne. The band's sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as the Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. The Wildhearts achieved several top 20 singles and two top 10 albums in Britain, though they also faced difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to drugs and depression. Much of the band's early career was affected by bitter feuds with their record company, East West.\n\nThroughout the band's history, members have regularly been replaced, with the only constant member being the band's founder, singer and guitarist Ginger. Several band members have appeared in the line-up more than once. The band has also been split up or placed on hiatus by Ginger multiple times. In the 2010s, the band convened occasionally for various anniversary tours. A 2018 anniversary tour by the band's 1995 lineup led to a return to the studio. They released a new album in 2019 (Renaissance Men) after a ten-year hiatus followed by 21st Century Love Songs in 2021. Their most recent album, Satanic Rites of the Wildhearts, was released in September 2025.\n\nCurrent line-up: \n\nGinger Wildheart – lead vocals, guitar (1989–1997, 1998, 1999, 2001–2022, 2024–present)\n\"Random\" Jon Poole – bass, backing vocals (2003–2005, 2012–2013, 2015–2018, 2024–present)\nBen Marsden – guitar, backing vocals (2024–present)\nPontus Snibb – drums (2024–present)\n\nDiscography\nEarth vs the Wildhearts (1993)\nP.H.U.Q.
