      "biography": "Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer-songwriter, musician and humanitarian activist who rose to fame as the original lead singer and flautist of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, Gabriel went on to a successful solo career, with \"Solsbury Hill\" his first single. His 1986 album, So, is his most commercially successful, and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the U.S. The album's biggest hit, \"Sledgehammer\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, and it remains the most played music video in the history of MTV.\nGabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has also pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \"Biko\". He has participated in several human rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the WITNESS human rights organisation in 1992. Gabriel developed The Elders with Richard Branson, which was launched by Nelson Mandela in 2007.\nGabriel has won three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male in 1987, six Grammy Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was made a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his \"influence on generations of music makers\". In recognition of his many years of human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, and TIME magazine named Gabriel one of the 100 most influential people in the world. AllMusic has described Gabriel as \"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, followed by his induction as a solo artist in 2014.",

      "editorial_notes": "Six years after the blockbuster success of the multi-platinum <i>So</i>, Peter Gabriel returned in 1992—somewhat less commercially minded, but no less sophisticated—with his sixth studio album, <i>Us</i>. It was recorded in his state-of-the-art Real World Studios, featured an extensive roster of musicians, and demonstrated Gabriel’s seemingly limitless appetite for pan-global rhythms and textures. But the elaborate sound of <i>Us</i> belies the lyrical content of the singer’s most open and confessional album. As its title implies, <i>Us</i> is the album in which Gabriel reaches out for love and connection, exploring his urges and desires over prismatic arrangements.\n\nGabriel explores his emotions after a tumultuous period: His first marriage ended after more than 15 years, leading to a new relationship with actress Rosanna Arquette, as well as a brief romance with Sinead O’Connor (who lends her gorgeous, crystalline voice to “Come Talk to Me” and the vulnerable duet “Blood of Eden”). “Come Talk to Me” is one of Gabriel’s most exposed moments, a plea to his teenage daughter, with whom he’d had trouble communicating after the divorce. Elsewhere on <i>Us</i>, tracks like “Love to Be Loved”, “Blood of Eden” and “Secret World” all explore the nature of romantic love with Gabriel’s masterful balance of the grandiose and the intimate. But despite the deeply personal subject matter, the arrangements explode in grandiose colours, thanks to co-producer Daniel Lanois, Senegal’s Babacar Faye Drummers, the vocals of Moscow’s Dmitri Pokrovsky Ensemble and the reedy sounds of bagpipes and the Armenian duduk.\n\nFollowing the runaway success of “Sledgehammer”, Gabriel was back to his horn-soaked tricks on the single “Steam”, another slice of Stax-style R&B that ended up being a Top 40 hit. The cheeky come-on “Kiss That Frog”, meanwhile, gets its groove from drum programming, synth bass and a loop of London’s Adzido Pan African Dance Ensemble. And the single “Digging in the Dirt” has a powerful pulse, courtesy of the rubbery bass by long-time Gabriel low-end Tony Levin. Emerging from self-reflections from recent therapy sessions, the song finds Gabriel exploring his shadowy side and his thoughtful side all at once.\n\nA chart success worldwide, <i>Us</i> would be followed by the ambitious Secret World Tour, a lengthy road trip that culminated in a headlining performance at Woodstock ’94. He wouldn’t return with a proper follow-up until nearly a decade later, leaving <i>Us</i> as his sole album of the 1990s. But it spent those years as a prime example of Gabriel as diarist, hitmaker, global unifier and ambitious studio visionary.",

And the single “Digging in the Dirt” has a powerful pulse, courtesy of the rubbery bass by long-time Gabriel low-end Tony Levin. Emerging from self-reflections from recent therapy sessions, the song finds Gabriel exploring his shadowy side and his thoughtful side all at once.\n\nA chart success worldwide, <i>Us</i> would be followed by the ambitious Secret World Tour, a lengthy road trip that culminated in a headlining performance at Woodstock ’94. He wouldn’t return with a proper follow-up until nearly a decade later, leaving <i>Us</i> as his sole album of the 1990s. But it spent those years as a prime example of Gabriel as diarist, hitmaker, global unifier and ambitious studio visionary."

The tour spawned a live album and a concert film. The album was also promoted through a first-of-its-kind interactive multimedia software released for Macintosh computers called Xplora1: Peter Gabriel's Secret World, which featured several music videos from the album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel/Us\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
