      "biography": "Fugazi are an American post-hardcore band that formed in Washington, D.C., in 1986. The band consists of guitarists and vocalists Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, bassist Joe Lally, and drummer Brendan Canty. They are noted for their style-transcending music, DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice and contempt for the music industry.\n\nSince its inception, Fugazi has been self-managed and have released almost all their material through Dischord Records, an independent label founded by MacKaye and partner Jeff Nelson in 1980. The band maintained a policy of affordable access to their work through low record and ticket prices and all-ages concerts.\n\nSays AMG All Music Guide, \"Along with their stridently underground ethics — which were more out of pragmatism and modesty than anything else — they gained an extremely loyal and numerous global following. To many, Fugazi meant as much to them as Bob Dylan did to their parents.\" \n\nThey played their first show in the fall of 1987 and since then released 7 albums and toured the world extensively covering all 50 United States, Europe, Australia, South America, Japan and many points in between.\n\nIn addition to their recorded output Fugazi released a documentary film/video called \"Instrument\" in collaboration with independent filmmaker, Jem Cohen. The feature length video offers a documentary overview of the the band's career with footage shot in a variety of formats over the last 10 years combining concert, tour and studio material backed with a musical soundtrack by the band unique to the movie.\n\nFugazi's last musical releases were The Argument, a 10 song LP, and Furniture, a 3 song single, released in the Fall of 2001. These sessions marked the first studio appearance of long time roadie and second drummer Jerry Busher who played additional drums and percussion on a number of the tracks on both releases. The recordings were once again made in collaboration with long time Fugazi engineer Don Zientara at Inner Ear studios.\n\nPrior to forming Fugazi, the members of the band played in various other bands with releases available on Dischord. \n\nFugazi are currently on hiatus as of 2002, with Mackaye in The Evens, Picciotto having produced various bands including Blonde Redhead and The Blood Brothers, and Lally playing with John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer on both Ataxia releases and working on a solo album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fugazi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "Fugazi came together in 1986, not long after Ian MacKaye—a vocalist, guitarist and hardcore pioneer—parted ways with Embrace, a lively mid-tempo punk act that had broken up after less than a year. Afterward, MacKaye teamed up with Joe Lally, a bass player who’d roadied with the D.C. act Beefeater. The two began fleshing out songs, and though it took some time to finalise Fugazi’s line-up, MacKaye and Lally eventually teamed with drummer Brendan Canty and guitarist and vocalist Guy Picciotto. All four musicians had been part of the politically charged, musically adventurous punk scene that had sprung up in Washington, D.C. in the 1980s, giving rise to acts like Minor Threat and Rites of Spring—bands that lasted only a few years, but would influence the sound and ethos of punk for decades to come.\n\nFor many listeners, Fugazi’s <i>13 Songs</i> would serve as a crucial intro to the D.C. sound. Released in 1989, it collects the band’s first two EPs, starting with 1988’s <i>Fugazi</i>. Those first seven songs—written mostly by MacKaye during the band’s first year, and produced by D.C. legend Ted Niceley—were recorded before Picciotto added his cutting Rickenbacker guitar to the mix. But these early tracks nonetheless feel fully formed, driven by Fugazi’s abstract yet topical lyrics, and a sound that incorporates everything from reggae to The Stooges: “Waiting Room” reflects MacKaye’s frustrations with being on the musical sidelines for a few years, while the Picciotto-sung “Give Me the Cure” takes aim at the AIDS crisis. “Suggestion”, meanwhile, takes a complex look at sexual harassment, and the extraordinary “Glue Man”—a fan-favourite that often closed the band’s mesmerising live shows—morphs from an observation of a drug addict to a galaxy-brain jam. \n\nThe <i>Fugazi</i> EP remains a remarkable first effort. And it’s a testament to the strength of the band’s songwriting that <i>Fugazi</i>’s seven songs pair so perfectly with the tracks from 1989’s <i>Margin Walker</i> EP. Produced with traditional rock-band slickness by long-time band ally John Loder, <i>Margin Waker</i> hints at a new and more powerful phase for the band. You can hear their ever-growing dynamism on the fiery title track, as well as cuts like “And the Same” (which addresses the complexity of movements versus individuals) and “Burning Too” (a warning of the world’s coming environmental chaos). It all ends with “Promises”—a track that closes out not just the <i>Margin Walker</i> EP, but also <i>13 Songs</i>. It’s a song that espouses the importance of actions over words—and over the course of Fugazi’s years-long run, few bands’ actions would speak louder. <i>13 Songs</i> is more than just an essential punk primer; it’s one of the greatest rock albums of all time.",
