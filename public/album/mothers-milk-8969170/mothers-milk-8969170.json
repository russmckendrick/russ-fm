      "biography": "Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982. Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock and psychedelic rock. The band consists of co-founders Anthony Kiedis (lead vocals) and Flea (bass), as well as drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante, the latter of whom has been in the band across three stints. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, Red Hot Chili Peppers is one of the best-selling bands of all time. They are the most successful band in the history of alternative rock, with the records for most number-one singles (13), most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and most top-ten songs (25) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The band has won six Grammy Awards, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, Freaky Styley (1985), and Irons for their third, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.\n\nWith new recruits Frusciante and Smith, Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded Mother's Milk (1989) and their first major commercial success, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album,  Californication (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. By the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006) were also successful;  Stadium Arcadium was their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on I'm with You (2011) and The Getaway (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th album, Unlimited Love, in 2022.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' mix of hard rock, funk and hip hop has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock and nu metal. Kiedis said the band were early to combine \"hardcore funk and hip-hop-style vocals\", and suggested they had influenced Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Linkin Park. Smith said, \"Certainly Anthony's singing style and voice lends itself to being unique, and nobody sounds like him. The cool thing about it is we can play any style of music whether it's hard and fast, or loud or quiet, slow or medium, whatever it is; rock or funk, and it still sounds like us. I'm proud of that because sometimes bands don't have that strong personality where you go, 'Oh, that's boom, right away.'\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame In April 2012. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez; Frusciante was invited, but did not attend. Navarro and Sherman were not inducted; Sherman said he felt \"dishonored\". The band performed \"By the Way\", \"Give It Away\" and \"Higher Ground\", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in more than 20 years.\n\nIn 2003, Rolling Stone released their first list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", with Blood Sugar Sex Magik at 310 and Californication at 399. In 2012, a revised list was released, with Californication at 401. In 2020, Rolling Stone released another version of the list, with  Blood Sugar Sex Magik at 186 and Californication at 286.\n\nThe band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 31, 2022 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "Following the death of founding guitarist Hillel Slovak in 1988 and the subsequent departure of founding drummer Jack Irons, the Red Hot Chili Peppers rebooted as an alternative-rock powerhouse that would dominate alternative radio and fill arenas the world over. Eighteen-year-old wunderkind guitarist John Frusciante, raised on the wild solos of Frank Zappa and the spiraling filigrees of Slovak himself, would give the band a sensibility that was equal parts melodic and virtuosic. The incredibly hard-hitting drummer Chad Smith, a six-foot-three AOR-and-funk pounder from the Midwest, would provide the muscle and finesse that would carry the band through the 1990s and beyond. And with producer Michael Beinhorn adding a crunchy, alt-metal sheen, the lineup’s first album together, <i>Mother’s Milk</i>, would ultimately turn a cult underground band into a mainstream force: It would be the band’s first gold record, and finally let the band break into the Billboard Top 100.\n \nMuch of the success of <i>Mother’s Milk</i> can be credited to the band’s giddy cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground”, which reimagined the original’s silky organ melody as a deeply percussive machine-gun of slap-bass, and turned the chorus into a party sung by 25 of the Peppers’ closest friends. But not every moment on <i>Mother’s Milk</i> was as full of uplift. After spending much of the 1980s as an uncontainable punk-funk band, the Peppers began to turn introspective: The album’s second hit single, “Knock Me Down”, is a reflective look at drug addiction (Kiedis started it before Slovak’s death, and finished it as a love song for the departed guitarist). And “Taste the Pain”, recorded for the <i>Say Anything</i> soundtrack, describes a heartbreak in great detail: “Busted in two like a brittle stick,” Kiedis rap-sings, “I cannot drink because my throat constricts.”\n \nOf course, much of the Peppers 2.0 was as hedonistic as ever (“Stone Cold Bush”, “Sexy Mexican Maid”) and as celebratory as ever (“Good Time Boys”, “Subway to Venus”). However, it would be the album’s tender outlier, the vulnerable, sparse instrumental “Pretty Little Ditty”—not even two minutes long on the original issue—that would keep <i>Mother’s Milk</i> playing well into the next millennium. Nu-metal band Crazy Town would sample it for the delicate rap-rock power ballad “Butterfly”, a No. 1 hit in 2001.",

It has sold 2 million copies and certified double-platinum.  Mother's Milk peaked at #52 on Billboard Top 200 album chart and it was certified gold by mid-1990 and platinum in 2005.\n\nThe album produced three singles: \"Knock Me Down\", \"Higher Ground\" and \"Taste the Pain\".\nThough Mother's Milk is quite highly celebrated in the Red Hot Chili Pepper's fanbase, the band members have more than once expressed their mild dislike of the album. With the exception of The Jimi Hendrix Experience cover \"Fire\", none of Mother's Milk has been played live during the band's recent career.\n\nIn 2003, a remastered version of the album was released, including several unheard bonus tracks.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Mother%27s+Milk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
