      "biography": "Thomas Edward Yorke (born 7 October, 1968 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England) is best known as the lead singer of the English alternative rock band Radiohead. He has also recorded as a solo musician. His debut album, The Eraser, debuted July 10th 2006 in the UK and July 11th in the US. Two singles were released from the album, “Harrowdown Hill” and “Analyse”.\n\nYorke formed Atoms for Peace, who toured in 2010 performing the entirety of The Eraser. The rock ‘supergroup’ features Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, drummer Joey Waronker, and percussionist Mauro Refosco. \n\nThe song “Black Swan” was used as the end theme to the 2006 film adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s novel A Scanner Darkly and was also a successful hit on American alternative radio in the summer of 2006. “Analyse” was also used on the end credits of the film The Prestige. 2006 also saw the release of a Japan-only EP entitled Spitting Feathers, which collected together the five b-sides from the “Analyze” and “Harrowdown Hill” singles.\n\nA collection of remixes from The Eraser from such electronic luminaries as Burial, Four Tet, Modeselektor, Various Production and Surgeon were released as MP3 files initially in 2007, followed by a series of limited 12” in 2008. These were eventually released on CD as The Eraser Rmxs album.\n\nIn 2009, Yorke contributed a new song, “Hearing Damage”, to the soundtrack for The Twilight Saga: New Moon.\n\nHe mainly plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar and piano, but has also played drums and bass guitar (notably during the Kid A and Amnesiac Radiohead sessions).",

      "editorial_notes": "“How people may emotionally connect with music I’ve been involved in is something that part of me is completely mystified by,” Thom Yorke tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “Human beings are really different, so why would it be that what I do connects in that way? I discovered maybe around [Radiohead's album] <i>The Bends</i> that the bit I didn’t want to show, the vulnerable bit… that bit was the bit that mattered.”<br />\n<i>ANIMA</i>, Yorke’s third solo album, further weaponises that discovery. Obsessed by anxiety and dystopia, it might be the most disarmingly personal music of a career not short of anxiety and dystopia. “Dawn Chorus” feels like the centrepiece: It's stop-you-in-your-tracks beautiful with a claustrophobic “stream of consciousness” lyric that feels something like a slowly descending panic attack. And, as Yorke describes, it was the record's biggest challenge. “There’s a hit I have to get out of it,” he says. “I was trying to develop how ‘Dawn Chorus’ was going to work, and find the right combinations on the synthesisers I was using. Couldn’t find it, tried it again and again and again. But I knew when I found it I would have my way into the song. Things like that matter to me—they are sort of obsessive, but there is an emotional connection. I was deliberately trying to find something as cold as possible to go with it, like I sing essentially one note all the way through.”<br />\nYorke and long-time collaborator Nigel Godrich (“I think most artists, if they're honest, are never solo artists,” Yorke says) continue to transfuse raw feeling into the album’s chilling electronica. “Traffic”, with its jagged beats and “I can’t breathe” refrain, feels like a partner track to another memorable Yorke album opener, “Everything in Its Right Place”. The extraordinary “Not the News”, meanwhile, slaloms through bleeps and baleful strings to reach a thunderous final destination. It’s the work of a modern icon still engaged with his unique gift. “My cliché thing I always say is, 'You know you're in trouble when people stop listening to sad music,'” Yorke says. “Because the moment people stop listening to sad music, they don't want to know anymore. They're turning themselves off.”",

            "content": "\"ANIMA\" is the third solo album by Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, released on 27 June 2019 by XL Recordings. Yorke and longtime producer Nigel Godrich developed Anima through live performances and studio work. It was accompanied by a short film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson released on Netflix and in select IMAX theatres.\n\n\"ANIMA\" focuses on dystopian themes, with the title coming from Yorke’s interest in dreams. According to a June 2019 Zane Lowe interview covered by Pitchfork, Yorke said:\n\n\"I think the reason it ended up being called \"ANIMA\" was partly because I’m obsessed with this whole dream thing, and it comes from this concept that  Jung had. But, also, we have started to emulate what our devices say about us and emulate the way we behave from that. So, I had this whole thing where, like, the reason we can watch Boris Johnson lie through his teeth, promise something that we know will never happen is: We don’t have to connect with it directly because it’s a little avatar. It’s this little guy with a stupid haircut waving a flag… ‘That’s all right, that’s funny.’ And the consequences are not real. The consequences of everything we do are not real. We can remain anonymous. We send our avatar out to hurl abuse and poison, and then trot back anonymous.\n\nThe album was teased in mid-June 2019, just over a week before its release, in a number of cryptic ads placed internationally. Musically, the album applies electronic techniques from subgenres such as techno and jungle to his unique style of layered metaphors and oblique references, thus forming a uniquely “Yorkian” creation. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Thom+Yorke/ANIMA\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
