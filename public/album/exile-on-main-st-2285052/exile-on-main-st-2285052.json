      "biography": "The Rolling Stones is an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, got them gigs, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.\n\nRooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" (1965), \"Get Off of My Cloud\" (1965), and \"Paint It Black\" (1966) became international number-one hits. Aftermath (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by The Daily Telegraph to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit \"Ruby Tuesday\"/\"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and experimented with psychedelic rock on Their Satanic Majesties Request. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1968) and \"Honky Tonk Women\" (1969), and albums such as Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and \"Gimme Shelter\". Let It Bleed was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.\n\nJones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as \"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\". Sticky Fingers (1971), which yielded \"Brown Sugar\" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. Exile on Main St. (1972), featuring \"Tumbling Dice\", and Goats Head Soup (1973), yielding the hit ballad \"Angie\", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ron Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: Some Girls (1978), featuring \"Miss You\", and Tattoo You (1981), featuring \"Start Me Up\". Steel Wheels (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by Voodoo Lounge (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts' death. Their 2016 album, Blue & Lonesome, became their twelfth UK number-one album.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Billboard magazine and Rolling Stone have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones\n\nStudio albums\nThe Rolling Stones / England's Newest Hit Makers (1964)\n12 X 5 (1964)\nThe Rolling Stones No. 2 / The Rolling Stones, Now!

      "editorial_notes": "More than songs or performances, 1972’s <i>Exile on Main St.</i> was about mood. Listen close: Can you hear the young gods sweating it out in the basement of a French mansion overlooking the Mediterranean? Surrounded by junkies and hangers-on? Eating lobster and stuffed tomatoes in the afternoon and working all night? Never had the band managed to translate their myth—the sloppy, redemptive glory of rock ’n’ roll—so faithfully into sound. A great party album, yes, and a party unto itself. But <i>Exile</i> was also the closest The Rolling Stones ever got to something truly avant-garde, an album whose perceived mistakes—the muddy mix; the sloppy, dislocated performances—conjured a feeling something more correct would have wiped away.<br />\nEven in its looser moments, 1971’s <i>Sticky Fingers</i> had sounded professional—raw music gussied up for the main stage. <i>Exile</i>, by contrast, wasn’t just born in the basement, it evoked one: a place of clutter and darkness, strange things forgotten and unfinished. For every “Tumbling Dice” or “Torn and Frayed“—two of the album’s more coherent moments—there was an “I Just Want to See His Face” or “Let It Loose”, tracks that functioned less as finished thoughts than open-ended suggestions, seeds for new growth. And the blues that had once served as the band’s shorthand for earthly hardships and desires now sounded mysterious and arcane—less the entertainment of juke joints than the vernacular of some underground society.<br />\nThe story of <i>Exile</i> is probably oversold—after all, they only spent part of the time in the basement. But the frame remains useful. “I hear you talking when I’m on the street,” Mick slurs on the opening line of “Rocks Off”. “Your mouth don't move, but I can hear you speak.” For the next hour, the paradoxes keep coming: light in darkness, clarity in chaos. For years, the band had described confusion—with <i>Exile</i>, they embodied it.",

            "content": "Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band The Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records. The album's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, Exile on Main St. has been ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time.The 2010 remastered version of the album was released in Europe on 17 May 2010 and in the United States on 18 May 2010, featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks\n\nRecording:\nExile on Main St. was written and recorded between 1969 and 1972. Mick Jagger said \"After we got out of our contract with Allen Klein, we didn't want to give him ,\" as they were forced to do with \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" from Sticky Fingers (1971). Many tracks were recorded between 1969 and 1971 at Olympic Studios and Jagger's Stargroves country house in England during sessions for Sticky Fingers.By the spring of 1971 the Rolling Stones had spent the money they owed in taxes and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Mick Jagger settled in Paris with his new bride Bianca, and guitarist Keith Richards rented a villa, Nellcôte, in Villefranche-sur-Mer, near Nice. The other members settled in the south of France. As a suitable recording studio could not be found where they could continue work on the album, Richards' basement at Nellcôte became a makeshift studio using the band's mobile recording truck.\n\n1st Stage ar Nellcôte :\nRecording began in earnest sometime near the middle of June. Bassist Bill Wyman recalls the band working all night, every night, from eight in the evening until three the following morning for the rest of the month. Wyman said of that period, \"Not everyone turned up every night. This was, for me, one of the major frustrations of this whole period. For our previous two albums we had worked well and listened to producer Jimmy Miller. At Nellcôte things were very different and it took me a while to understand why.\" By this time Richards had begun a daily habit of using heroin. Thousands of pounds worth of heroin flowed through the mansion each week in addition to a contingent of visitors that included William S. Burroughs, Terry Southern, Gram Parsons and Marshall Chess (who was running the Rolling Stones' new label). Parsons was asked to leave Nellcôte in early July 1971, the result of his obnoxious behaviour and an attempt by Richards to clean the house of drug users as the result of pressure from the French police.\nRichards' substance abuse prevented him from attending the sessions that continued in his basement, while Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman were often unable to attend sessions for other reasons. This often left the band in the position of having to record in altered forms. A notable instance was the recording of one of Richards' most famous songs, \"Happy\". Recorded in the basement, Richards said in 1982, \"'Happy' was something I did because I was for one time early for a session. There was Bobby Keys and Jimmy Miller. We had nothing to do and had suddenly picked up the guitar and played this riff. So we cut it and it's the record, it's the same. We cut the original track with a baritone sax, a guitar and Jimmy Miller on drums. And the rest of it is built up over that track. It was just an afternoon jam that everybody said, 'Wow, yeah, work on it'\".\nThe basic band for the Nellcôte sessions consisted of Richards, Bobby Keys, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Miller (a skilled drummer in his own right who covered for the absent Watts on the aforementioned \"Happy\" and \"Shine a Light\"), and Jagger when he was available. Wyman did not like the ambience of Richards' villa and sat out many of the French sessions. Although Wyman is credited on only eight songs of the released album, he told Bass Player Magazine that the credits are incorrect and that he actually played on more tracks than that. The other bass parts were credited to Taylor, Richards and session bassist Bill Plummer. Wyman noted in his memoir Stone Alone that there was a division between the band members who freely indulged in drugs (Richards, Miller, Keys, Taylor, engineer Andy Johns) and those who abstained to varying degrees (Wyman, Watts and Jagger)\n\n2nd stage in Los Angeles:\nAdditional basic tracks (probably only \"Rip this Joint\", \"Shake Your Hips\", \"Casino Boogie\", \"Happy\", \"Rocks Off\", \"Turd on the Run\" and \"Ventilator Blues\") were begun in the basement of Nellcôte and taken to Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles where numerous overdubs (all piano and keyboard parts, all lead and backing vocals, all guitar and bass overdubs) were added during sessions that meandered from December 1971 until May 1972. Some tracks (such as \"Torn and Frayed\" and \"Loving Cup\") were freshly recorded in Los Angeles. Although Jagger was frequently missing from Nellcôte, he took charge during the second stage of recording in Los Angeles, arranging for the keyboardists Billy Preston and Dr John and the cream of the city's session backup vocalists to record layers of overdubs. The final gospel-inflected arrangements of \"Tumbling Dice\", \"Loving Cup\", \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\" were inspired by Jagger and Preston's visit to a local evangelical church.\nThe extended recording sessions and differing methods on the part of Jagger and Richards reflected the growing disparity in their personal lives. During the making of the album, Jagger had married Bianca, followed closely by the birth of their only child, Jade, in October 1971. Richards was firmly attached to his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, yet both were in the throes of heroin addiction, which Richards would not overcome until the turn of the decade.\n\nMusic and lyrics:\nEven though the album is often described as being Richards' finest moment, as Exile is often thought to reflect his vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound, Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time of the album's release. With Richards' effectiveness seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group's subsequent 1970s releases—directed largely by Jagger—would experiment to varying degrees with other musical genres, moving away from the roots-based sound of Exile on Main St Music biographer John Perry wrote that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the album that was \"entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock & roll and 1930s-1940s swing\".\nAccording to Robert Christgau, Exile on Main St. expanded on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as Sticky Fingers: \"It piled all the old themes—sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance, craziness, release—on top of an obsession with time that was more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered youth music\n\nRelease and reception: \nPreceded by the UK and US Top 10 hit \"Tumbling Dice\", Exile on Main St was released in May 1972. It was an immediate commercial success, reaching No. 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many songs from the new album. \"Happy\", sung by Richards, would be a Top 30 US hit later that summer.\nBy the late 1970s, critics had come to view Exile on Main St as the Rolling Stones' greatest album. Lenny Kaye of Rolling Stone observed \"a tight focus on basic components of the Stones' sound as we've always known it, knock-down rock and roll stemming from blues, backed with a pervading feeling of blackness that the Stones have seldom failed to handle well.\" He felt that there are songs that are better, there are songs that are worse, and others you'll probably lift the needle for when the time is due\", and asserted that \"the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come\". Other critics praised the album's rawness and different styles, from blues to country to soul. Richard Williams of Melody Maker said that the album \"is definitely going to take its place in history\" and called it \"the best album they've ever made\", writing that it \"utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock 'n' rollers.\" Bill Janovitz called it \"the greatest, most soulful, rock & roll record ever made\" because it seamlessly distills \"perhaps all the essential elements of rock & roll up to 1971, if not beyond\". In his year-end list for Newsday, Christgau named it the best album of 1972 and wrote that \"this fagged-out masterpiece\" was the peak of rock music in 1972 and that it \"explores new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick's voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui\".\nOn the initial critical and commercial reaction, Richards said, \"When  came out it didn't sell particularly well at the beginning, and it was also pretty much universally panned. But within a few years the people who had written the reviews saying it was a piece of crap were extolling it as the best frigging album in the world.\"\nExile on Main St featured a gatefold cover and included a series of 12 perforated postcards with a sequence of images inserts, all of which were shot by photographer Norman Seeff. The back cover features various photos of the Stones; the \"mystery woman\" pictured in the lower left side is Chris O'Dell, their personal assistant. The album photography and concept was by Robert Frank and includes images from his seminal 1958 book The Americans. The \"Joe Allen\" pictured in the collage is of a postcard-style advertisement by Frank of the contortionist, Joe Allen, billed as \"The Human Corkscrew\" for his ability to wiggle and twist through the \"13 1/2 inch hoop\" approximately 25,000 times during his circus career, according to an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 8 May 1950. The man with the three balls (a tennis ball, a golf ball, and a \"5\" billiard ball) in his mouth is formally known as \"Three Ball Charlie\", a 1930's sideshow performer from Humboldt, Nebraska who could also not only balance on several balls at once, but could also juggle balls, and whistle, all while performing all 4 tasks simultaneously, according to Ripley's\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted.\n\nSide one\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n1.\t\"Rocks Off\"  \t4:31\n2.\t\"Rip This Joint\"  \t2:22\n3.\t\"Shake Your Hips\" (Slim Harpo)\t2:59\n4.\t\"Casino Boogie\"  \t3:33\n5.\t\"Tumbling Dice\"  \t3:45\nSide two\t\nNo.\t   Title\t    Length\t\n6.\t\"Sweet Virginia\"  \t4:27\n7.\t\"Torn and Frayed\"  \t4:17\n8.\t\"Sweet Black Angel\"  \t2:54\n9.\t\"Loving Cup\"  \t4:25\nSide three\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n10.\t\"Happy\"  \t3:04\n11.\t\"Turd on the Run\"  \t2:36\n12.\t\"Ventilator Blues\" (Jagger/Richards/Mick Taylor)\t3:24\n13.\t\"I Just Want to See His Face\"  \t2:52\n14.\t\"Let It Loose\"  \t5:16\nSide four\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n15.\t\"All Down the Line\"  \t3:49\n16.\t\"Stop Breaking Down\" (Robert Johnson)\t4:34\n17.\t\"Shine a Light\"  \t4:14\n18.\t\"Soul Survivor\"  \n\n\nPersonnel\nMick Jagger – lead vocals, harmonica, percussion; guitar on \"Tumbling Dice\" and \"Stop Breaking Down\"\nKeith Richards – guitars, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Happy\"; electric piano on \"I Just Want to See His Face\"; bass guitar on \"Casino Boogie\", \"Happy\" and \"Soul Survivor\"\nMick Taylor – guitars, slide guitar; bass guitar on \"Tumbling Dice\", \"Torn and Frayed\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nBill Wyman – bass guitar\nCharlie Watts – drums\nAdditional personnel\nNicky Hopkins – piano\nBobby Keys – saxophone, percussion on \"Happy\"\nJim Price – trumpet, trombone, organ on \"Torn and Frayed\"\nIan Stewart – piano on \"Shake Your Hips\", \"Sweet Virginia\" and \"Stop Breaking Down\"\nJimmy Miller – drums on \"Tumbling Dice\" (the outro), \"Happy\" and \"Shine a Light\", percussion on \"Sweet Black Angel\", \"Loving Cup\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"All Down the Line\"\nBill Plummer – upright bass on \"Rip This Joint\", \"Turd on the Run\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"All Down the Line\"\nBilly Preston – piano and organ on \"Shine a Light\"\nAl Perkins – pedal steel guitar on \"Torn and Frayed\"\nRichard Washington – marimba on \"Sweet Black Angel\"\nClydie King, Venetta Fields – backing vocals on \"Tumbling Dice\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\", \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nJoe Green – backing vocals on \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nChris Shepard – tambourine on \"Turd on the Run\"\nJerry Kirkland – backing vocals on \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nMac Rebennack, Shirley Goodman, Tami Lynn – backing vocals on \"Let It Loose\"\nKathi McDonald – backing vocals on \"All Down the Line\"\nEngineers – Glyn and Andy Johns, Joe Zaganno, Jeremy Gee\nCover photography/concept – Robert Frank\nLayout design – John Van Hamersveld, Norman Seeff\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Exile+on+Main+St.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band The Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records. The album's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, Exile on Main St. has been ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time.The 2010 remastered version of the album was released in Europe on 17 May 2010 and in the United States on 18 May 2010, featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks\n\nRecording:\nExile on Main St. was written and recorded between 1969 and 1972. Mick Jagger said \"After we got out of our contract with Allen Klein, we didn't want to give him ,\" as they were forced to do with \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" from Sticky Fingers (1971). Many tracks were recorded between 1969 and 1971 at Olympic Studios and Jagger's Stargroves country house in England during sessions for Sticky Fingers.By the spring of 1971 the Rolling Stones had spent the money they owed in taxes and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Mick Jagger settled in Paris with his new bride Bianca, and guitarist Keith Richards rented a villa, Nellcôte, in Villefranche-sur-Mer, near Nice. The other members settled in the south of France. As a suitable recording studio could not be found where they could continue work on the album, Richards' basement at Nellcôte became a makeshift studio using the band's mobile recording truck.\n\n1st Stage ar Nellcôte :\nRecording began in earnest sometime near the middle of June. Bassist Bill Wyman recalls the band working all night, every night, from eight in the evening until three the following morning for the rest of the month. Wyman said of that period, \"Not everyone turned up every night. This was, for me, one of the major frustrations of this whole period. For our previous two albums we had worked well and listened to producer Jimmy Miller. At Nellcôte things were very different and it took me a while to understand why.\" By this time Richards had begun a daily habit of using heroin. Thousands of pounds worth of heroin flowed through the mansion each week in addition to a contingent of visitors that included William S. Burroughs, Terry Southern, Gram Parsons and Marshall Chess (who was running the Rolling Stones' new label). Parsons was asked to leave Nellcôte in early July 1971, the result of his obnoxious behaviour and an attempt by Richards to clean the house of drug users as the result of pressure from the French police.\nRichards' substance abuse prevented him from attending the sessions that continued in his basement, while Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman were often unable to attend sessions for other reasons. This often left the band in the position of having to record in altered forms. A notable instance was the recording of one of Richards' most famous songs, \"Happy\". Recorded in the basement, Richards said in 1982, \"'Happy' was something I did because I was for one time early for a session. There was Bobby Keys and Jimmy Miller. We had nothing to do and had suddenly picked up the guitar and played this riff. So we cut it and it's the record, it's the same. We cut the original track with a baritone sax, a guitar and Jimmy Miller on drums. And the rest of it is built up over that track. It was just an afternoon jam that everybody said, 'Wow, yeah, work on it'\".\nThe basic band for the Nellcôte sessions consisted of Richards, Bobby Keys, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Miller (a skilled drummer in his own right who covered for the absent Watts on the aforementioned \"Happy\" and \"Shine a Light\"), and Jagger when he was available. Wyman did not like the ambience of Richards' villa and sat out many of the French sessions. Although Wyman is credited on only eight songs of the released album, he told Bass Player Magazine that the credits are incorrect and that he actually played on more tracks than that. The other bass parts were credited to Taylor, Richards and session bassist Bill Plummer. Wyman noted in his memoir Stone Alone that there was a division between the band members who freely indulged in drugs (Richards, Miller, Keys, Taylor, engineer Andy Johns) and those who abstained to varying degrees (Wyman, Watts and Jagger)\n\n2nd stage in Los Angeles:\nAdditional basic tracks (probably only \"Rip this Joint\", \"Shake Your Hips\", \"Casino Boogie\", \"Happy\", \"Rocks Off\", \"Turd on the Run\" and \"Ventilator Blues\") were begun in the basement of Nellcôte and taken to Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles where numerous overdubs (all piano and keyboard parts, all lead and backing vocals, all guitar and bass overdubs) were added during sessions that meandered from December 1971 until May 1972. Some tracks (such as \"Torn and Frayed\" and \"Loving Cup\") were freshly recorded in Los Angeles. Although Jagger was frequently missing from Nellcôte, he took charge during the second stage of recording in Los Angeles, arranging for the keyboardists Billy Preston and Dr John and the cream of the city's session backup vocalists to record layers of overdubs. The final gospel-inflected arrangements of \"Tumbling Dice\", \"Loving Cup\", \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\" were inspired by Jagger and Preston's visit to a local evangelical church.\nThe extended recording sessions and differing methods on the part of Jagger and Richards reflected the growing disparity in their personal lives. During the making of the album, Jagger had married Bianca, followed closely by the birth of their only child, Jade, in October 1971. Richards was firmly attached to his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, yet both were in the throes of heroin addiction, which Richards would not overcome until the turn of the decade.\n\nMusic and lyrics:\nEven though the album is often described as being Richards' finest moment, as Exile is often thought to reflect his vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound, Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time of the album's release. With Richards' effectiveness seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group's subsequent 1970s releases—directed largely by Jagger—would experiment to varying degrees with other musical genres, moving away from the roots-based sound of Exile on Main St Music biographer John Perry wrote that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the album that was \"entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock & roll and 1930s-1940s swing\".\nAccording to Robert Christgau, Exile on Main St. expanded on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as Sticky Fingers: \"It piled all the old themes—sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance, craziness, release—on top of an obsession with time that was more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered youth music\n\nRelease and reception: \nPreceded by the UK and US Top 10 hit \"Tumbling Dice\", Exile on Main St was released in May 1972. It was an immediate commercial success, reaching No. 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many songs from the new album. \"Happy\", sung by Richards, would be a Top 30 US hit later that summer.\nBy the late 1970s, critics had come to view Exile on Main St as the Rolling Stones' greatest album. Lenny Kaye of Rolling Stone observed \"a tight focus on basic components of the Stones' sound as we've always known it, knock-down rock and roll stemming from blues, backed with a pervading feeling of blackness that the Stones have seldom failed to handle well.\" He felt that there are songs that are better, there are songs that are worse, and others you'll probably lift the needle for when the time is due\", and asserted that \"the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come\". Other critics praised the album's rawness and different styles, from blues to country to soul. Richard Williams of Melody Maker said that the album \"is definitely going to take its place in history\" and called it \"the best album they've ever made\", writing that it \"utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock 'n' rollers.\" Bill Janovitz called it \"the greatest, most soulful, rock & roll record ever made\" because it seamlessly distills \"perhaps all the essential elements of rock & roll up to 1971, if not beyond\". In his year-end list for Newsday, Christgau named it the best album of 1972 and wrote that \"this fagged-out masterpiece\" was the peak of rock music in 1972 and that it \"explores new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick's voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui\".\nOn the initial critical and commercial reaction, Richards said, \"When  came out it didn't sell particularly well at the beginning, and it was also pretty much universally panned. But within a few years the people who had written the reviews saying it was a piece of crap were extolling it as the best frigging album in the world.\"\nExile on Main St featured a gatefold cover and included a series of 12 perforated postcards with a sequence of images inserts, all of which were shot by photographer Norman Seeff. The back cover features various photos of the Stones; the \"mystery woman\" pictured in the lower left side is Chris O'Dell, their personal assistant. The album photography and concept was by Robert Frank and includes images from his seminal 1958 book The Americans. The \"Joe Allen\" pictured in the collage is of a postcard-style advertisement by Frank of the contortionist, Joe Allen, billed as \"The Human Corkscrew\" for his ability to wiggle and twist through the \"13 1/2 inch hoop\" approximately 25,000 times during his circus career, according to an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 8 May 1950. The man with the three balls (a tennis ball, a golf ball, and a \"5\" billiard ball) in his mouth is formally known as \"Three Ball Charlie\", a 1930's sideshow performer from Humboldt, Nebraska who could also not only balance on several balls at once, but could also juggle balls, and whistle, all while performing all 4 tasks simultaneously, according to Ripley's\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted.\n\nSide one\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n1.\t\"Rocks Off\"  \t4:31\n2.\t\"Rip This Joint\"  \t2:22\n3.\t\"Shake Your Hips\" (Slim Harpo)\t2:59\n4.\t\"Casino Boogie\"  \t3:33\n5.\t\"Tumbling Dice\"  \t3:45\nSide two\t\nNo.\t   Title\t    Length\t\n6.\t\"Sweet Virginia\"  \t4:27\n7.\t\"Torn and Frayed\"  \t4:17\n8.\t\"Sweet Black Angel\"  \t2:54\n9.\t\"Loving Cup\"  \t4:25\nSide three\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n10.\t\"Happy\"  \t3:04\n11.\t\"Turd on the Run\"  \t2:36\n12.\t\"Ventilator Blues\" (Jagger/Richards/Mick Taylor)\t3:24\n13.\t\"I Just Want to See His Face\"  \t2:52\n14.\t\"Let It Loose\"  \t5:16\nSide four\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n15.\t\"All Down the Line\"  \t3:49\n16.\t\"Stop Breaking Down\" (Robert Johnson)\t4:34\n17.\t\"Shine a Light\"  \t4:14\n18.\t\"Soul Survivor\"  \n\n\nPersonnel\nMick Jagger – lead vocals, harmonica, percussion; guitar on \"Tumbling Dice\" and \"Stop Breaking Down\"\nKeith Richards – guitars, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Happy\"; electric piano on \"I Just Want to See His Face\"; bass guitar on \"Casino Boogie\", \"Happy\" and \"Soul Survivor\"\nMick Taylor – guitars, slide guitar; bass guitar on \"Tumbling Dice\", \"Torn and Frayed\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nBill Wyman – bass guitar\nCharlie Watts – drums\nAdditional personnel\nNicky Hopkins – piano\nBobby Keys – saxophone, percussion on \"Happy\"\nJim Price – trumpet, trombone, organ on \"Torn and Frayed\"\nIan Stewart – piano on \"Shake Your Hips\", \"Sweet Virginia\" and \"Stop Breaking Down\"\nJimmy Miller – drums on \"Tumbling Dice\" (the outro), \"Happy\" and \"Shine a Light\", percussion on \"Sweet Black Angel\", \"Loving Cup\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"All Down the Line\"\nBill Plummer – upright bass on \"Rip This Joint\", \"Turd on the Run\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"All Down the Line\"\nBilly Preston – piano and organ on \"Shine a Light\"\nAl Perkins – pedal steel guitar on \"Torn and Frayed\"\nRichard Washington – marimba on \"Sweet Black Angel\"\nClydie King, Venetta Fields – backing vocals on \"Tumbling Dice\", \"I Just Want to See His Face\", \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nJoe Green – backing vocals on \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nChris Shepard – tambourine on \"Turd on the Run\"\nJerry Kirkland – backing vocals on \"I Just Want to See His Face\" and \"Shine a Light\"\nMac Rebennack, Shirley Goodman, Tami Lynn – backing vocals on \"Let It Loose\"\nKathi McDonald – backing vocals on \"All Down the Line\"\nEngineers – Glyn and Andy Johns, Joe Zaganno, Jeremy Gee\nCover photography/concept – Robert Frank\nLayout design – John Van Hamersveld, Norman Seeff\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Exile+on+Main+St.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
