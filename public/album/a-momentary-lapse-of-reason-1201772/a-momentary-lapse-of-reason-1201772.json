      "biography": "Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright was pushed out of Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters decision to leave in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was created using unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions, along with new recordings. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason released the most recent Pink Floyd recording, the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  As of 2024, the band is back on hiatus, with Gilmour stating his willingness to reconvene under the right circumstances.\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Album Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd\n\nStudio albums\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)\nA Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\nMore (1969)\nUmmagumma (1969)\nAtom Heart Mother (1970)\nMeddle (1971)\nObscured by Clouds (1972)\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973)\nWish You Were Here (1975)\nAnimals (1977)\nThe Wall (1979)\nThe Final Cut (1983)\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)\nThe Division Bell (1994)\nThe Endless River (2014) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Begun as a solo album, this became the relaunch of Pink Floyd when cofounders Rick Wright and Nick Mason joined in. Gilmour's less-acidic worldview means <i>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</i> lacks the pointed lyrical edge of the last handful of Floyd albums. But the lush, richly detailed arrangements of tracks like the dreamy \"Learning to Fly\" give Gilmour's liquid guitar solos room to evolve.",

          "short": "With Waters gone, Gilmour answers the question \"Which one's Pink?\"",
          "standard": "David Gilmour took some criticism for carrying on Pink Floyd without Roger Waters—not least from Waters himself. Begun as a solo album, this became the relaunch of Pink Floyd when cofounders Rick Wright and Nick Mason joined in. Gilmour's less-acidic worldview means <i>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</i> lacks the pointed lyrical edge of the last handful of Floyd albums. But the lush, richly detailed arrangements of tracks like the dreamy \"Learning to Fly\" give Gilmour's liquid guitar solos room to evolve."

            "content": "A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in the UK on 7 September 1987 by EMI and the following day in the US on Columbia. It was recorded primarily on guitarist David Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria.\n\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason was the first Pink Floyd album recorded without founding member Roger Waters, who departed in 1985. The production was marred by legal fights over the rights to the Pink Floyd name, which were not resolved until several months after release. It also saw the return of keyboardist and founding member Richard Wright, who was fired from the band by Waters during the recording of The Wall (1979).\n\nUnlike most earlier Pink Floyd records, A Momentary Lapse of Reason is not a concept album. It includes writing contributions from outside songwriters, following Gilmour's decision to include material once intended for his third solo album.
