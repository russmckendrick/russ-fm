      "biography": "R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry. One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention due to Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. R.E.M. disbanded in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.",

      "editorial_notes": "In March 1991, the same month R.E.M. released its chart-topping seventh album <i>Out of Time</i>, the Canadian comedy group The Kids in the Hall debuted a dark sketch about suicide on its HBO series. In the routine, titled “The Long Note”, the Kids criticise a friend whose farewell note went on too long, while praising another friend’s more concise send-off: “I hear that R.E.M.’s turning it into a song,” remarks Dave Foley, one of the Kids.\n\nAt this stage in the band’s career, R.E.M. had a (somewhat deserved) reputation as a group that specialised in what singer Michael Stipe called “big, heavy songs”. He and his bandmates had begun revising that reputation a few albums earlier, incorporating more of a mainstream rock sound, while also cautiously embracing sugary pop hooks. <i>Out of Time</i> has some of both—but it was a big, heavy song, “Losing My Religion”, that gave R.E.M. their final push into full-on stardom.\n\n“Losing My Religion”, based around a mandolin part by Peter Buck—who’d just begun learning to play it—was one of R.E.M.’s weirdest songs, with no guitar and no chorus: As Stipe once asked, “What kind of pop song is that?” But “Religion” showcased the contours of his craggy baritone, and his poised performance of the song’s enigmatic lyrics pushed it to No. 4 on the Hot 100 pop chart, making for the biggest hit of the band’s career.\n\nThough it was far less of a hit, “Shiny Happy People” is the band’s broadest attempt at bubblegum pop, one that prompted plenty of long-term R.E.M. fans to roll their eyes (Stipe, who seemingly agreed, called it “a fruity pop song written for children”). Meanwhile, on “Radio Song”, Buck moves from a glorious arpeggio to funky rhythm chords, and Stipe sweetly mocks the pap that’s coming from a Top 40 station, while acknowledging it has a hold on him. The guest spot from rapper KRS-One—“Baby, baby, baby, baby/That stuff is driving me crazy”—moves the song away from Stipe’s ambivalence, and replaces it with a moralistic disdain.\n\n“Near Wild Heaven” has one of bassist Mike Mills’ occasional lead vocals, and it returns R.E.M. to a guitar-based style the band members clearly weren’t ready to abandon. But the album is chiefly about musical evolution.

          "standard": "In March 1991, the same month R.E.M. released its chart-topping seventh album <i>Out of Time</i>, the Canadian comedy group The Kids in the Hall debuted a dark sketch about suicide on its HBO series. In the routine, titled “The Long Note”, the Kids criticise a friend whose farewell note went on too long, while praising another friend’s more concise send-off: “I hear that R.E.M.’s turning it into a song,” remarks Dave Foley, one of the Kids.\n\nAt this stage in the band’s career, R.E.M. had a (somewhat deserved) reputation as a group that specialised in what singer Michael Stipe called “big, heavy songs”. He and his bandmates had begun revising that reputation a few albums earlier, incorporating more of a mainstream rock sound, while also cautiously embracing sugary pop hooks. <i>Out of Time</i> has some of both—but it was a big, heavy song, “Losing My Religion”, that gave R.E.M. their final push into full-on stardom.\n\n“Losing My Religion”, based around a mandolin part by Peter Buck—who’d just begun learning to play it—was one of R.E.M.’s weirdest songs, with no guitar and no chorus: As Stipe once asked, “What kind of pop song is that?” But “Religion” showcased the contours of his craggy baritone, and his poised performance of the song’s enigmatic lyrics pushed it to No. 4 on the Hot 100 pop chart, making for the biggest hit of the band’s career.\n\nThough it was far less of a hit, “Shiny Happy People” is the band’s broadest attempt at bubblegum pop, one that prompted plenty of long-term R.E.M. fans to roll their eyes (Stipe, who seemingly agreed, called it “a fruity pop song written for children”). Meanwhile, on “Radio Song”, Buck moves from a glorious arpeggio to funky rhythm chords, and Stipe sweetly mocks the pap that’s coming from a Top 40 station, while acknowledging it has a hold on him. The guest spot from rapper KRS-One—“Baby, baby, baby, baby/That stuff is driving me crazy”—moves the song away from Stipe’s ambivalence, and replaces it with a moralistic disdain.\n\n“Near Wild Heaven” has one of bassist Mike Mills’ occasional lead vocals, and it returns R.E.M. to a guitar-based style the band members clearly weren’t ready to abandon. But the album is chiefly about musical evolution. Kate Pierson of The B-52’s adds background vocals—“Shiny Happy People” is pretty much a duet with Stipe—and the songs integrate saxophone, steel guitar, loops and harpsichord.
