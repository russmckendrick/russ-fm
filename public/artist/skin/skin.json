  "biography": "“I see myself as an artist more than a musician, not only because I play guitar worse than a deaf camel, but because being in a band has always required a lot more skills than just songwriting and singing,” says Skin. “You have to dip your fingers in other art forms (like film, theatre, books) in order to create something wonderful from the clash of egos which are part of being in a great band.”\n\nSkin is one of Britain’s leading female rock singers. She is also a fashion icon, a renowned DJ, a charity activist, and an inspiring role model for different generations of fans. Born and brought up in Brixton, south London, she defied expectations as a black woman vocalist by diving headlong into hardcore rock, rather than becoming a soul session singer. Since she emerged in the early ‘90s with Skunk Anansie, Skin has been a groundbreaking presence. “I’m not up there trying to be a babe. I’m sexual but not in a girly, wimpy way. Our music has attitude, it’s in yer face, so I have my own parameters,” she said in 1995.\n\nIn 1992 Skin gave up her career as an interior designer to write songs and devote herself to music. She played in bands on the North London indie scene before joining forces with bass player Cass and guitarist Ace to form Skunk Anansie (so-called after the West African folk tales of Anansi, the spider man). The group played their first gig at London's Splash club in 1994 and within a year were voted Best New British Band by the readers of Kerrang! Magazine. After the award ceremony drummer Mark Richardson joined the band as their permanent drummer.\n\nA multi-racial band with a sound that collides brooding, funky beats with edgy lyrics, driving riffs and fragile ballads, Skunk Anansie broke barriers from the start. When someone once asked her about Brit-rock, Skin jokingly replied: “We’re more clit-rock than Brit-rock”, and the term “clit-rock” was then celebrated as an alternative to macho “cock rock”. By 1995 the group appeared with two of their songs, ‘Feed’ and ‘Selling Jesus’, on the soundtrack of the Kathryn Bigelow film Strange Days. After hearing the song ‘Selling Jesus’, radio ‘shock jock’ Howard Stern predicted that the band would become huge. In 1996 they were voted Kerrang!'s Best British Live Act and the following year they were nominated for Best Live Act and Best Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nIn the ‘90s Skunk Anansie dominated the album charts with Paranoid and Sunburnt  (1995), Stoosh (1995) and Post Orgasmic Chill (1996). They had a succession of hit singles including the devastating ballads ‘Brazen (Weep)’, ‘Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good)’, and ‘Weak’, where, with her rich, soulful voice Skin seemed to reach deep inside to draw out powerful emotion. There’s also her personal favourite, ‘Secretly’. “You should have been by yourself/Instead of here with me...secretly,”  she sang with operatic intensity, sounding like a collision between Robert Plant and Martha Wainwright.\n\nSkunk Anansie toured globally with such acts as U2, Aerosmith, Lenny Kravitz, Veruca Salt, and Rammstein, and headlined Glastonbury in 1999. In 2001 however, they split up. “We’d burned ourselves out by working too hard. We were touring and recording constantly, all living separate lives. The chemistry and spirit disappeared. It’s not rock-by-numbers - you have to feel it,” says Skin.\n\nShe launched a solo career, releasing and touring the albums Fleshwounds in 2003 and Fake Chemical State in 2006. Spawning the hit single ‘Trashed’, Fleshwounds was a pared-down, soulful album. Skin describes it as “very down-tempo. That was my mood at the time, I was sad and melancholy, I’d had a relationship that fell apart.”  Fake Chemical State  saw her in a more upbeat, mischievous mood. “That album was happier, rock-tastic. I was on my way back to Skunk Anansie, to myself.”\n\nThe band got back together, and in April 2009 played two shows at London Water Rats (former Splash Club and the place where they’d started). The gigs sold out in five minutes. That year they released the ‘greatest hits’ album Smashes & Trashes (which included three new tracks and a Remix collection) and did a sell-out European tour. “It’s been very natural and unforced - a bit like coming home. We have a huge fanbase that’s been screaming out for us to do some work,” Skin said of their reunion. “We got back together because we have a strong chemistry. It’s all about the future for us, not the past.” Fired up by their tour the band went into the studio in spring 2010 and recorded their fourth album Wonderlustre, a set that flows from soaring and elegaic to  locked-down, sensual and funky. Released in September 2010, the album includes the declarative single ‘My Ugly Boy’ (which was featured exclusively on Kerrang.com) and the gothic, slow-burning ‘My Love Will Fall’.\n\nAs well as fronting one of the UK’s key bands, Skin is a multi-talented artist involved in varied projects. She is also an established DJ, playing “tech house, minimal, and then I’ll throw on a rock record in the middle to fuck everybody up!” She has played out at classic venues like Club Q in Zurich, with such DJs as Martin Buttrich, Clive Henry and Smokin Jo, Luciano.\n\nShe has contributed guest vocals to numerous projects, including ‘Carmen Queasy’ from Maxim (from the Prodigy’s) solo album Hell’s Kitchen, and ‘Meat’ from Tony Iommi’s album Iommi. Her 2008 song ‘Tear Down These Houses’ featured on the soundtrack to Silvio Muccino’s film Parlami d'Amore, and was nominated for an Italian Oscar.\n\nWith her trademark bald head and striking image, Skin has also become a muse for key photographers like Mario Testino, Nick Knight and Derek Santini. She has modeled for top fashion designers, wearing Alexander McQueen for Fashion Rocks in 2003, and then Gucci in 2005. She has also modeled for Gianfranco Ferre and the Italian couture designer Liborio Capizzi. “I love fashion. It’s an art form,” says Skin. “If you’re the lead singer of a rock band you have your picture taken non-stop, and it’s interesting to develop the visual side. I’m not typical fashion, a blank canvas. I come with personality, a canvas with lots of colours!\n\nAnd away from the limelight, Skin does a lot of charity work. She has been involved with The Medical Foundation and the Baobab Foundation, charities that focus on torture victims and asylum seekers. “I have done music therapy with asylum seekers and help them integrate into society. I’ve worked with young people who come to this country with no papers, some have been pulled from rape camps, some are child soldiers. They’ve been through so much.” She is also actively involved in the global campaign against genital mutilation. “It is a basic human right for women of all cutlures to hold and express our sexuality and keep/control the heart of our womanhood” she asserts.\n\nSo Skin remains a pivotal force in music - not just as a rock singer but also as and cultural icon. Continually pushing boundaries, she proves that one’s potential can be limitless. From the beginning she forged her own way. As she says: “A bit of anger can be very useful in the right place and time, it gives you sparks, gets you moving, feeds your passion, separates the girls from the toys!”",

A german post-punk band from Flensburg.\\n9. A Boston, MA, USA new wave band.\\n\\n1) A pseudonym of British rock singer / guitarist Deborah Anne Dyer (b. 3rd Aug 1967, Brixton, London, England), lead vocalist with Skunk Anansie. Under this name, she débuted solo with the single \"Trashed\" (June 2003, EMI) and the latest is \"Tear Down These Houses\" (Dec 2007, Sony BMG Music Entertainment).\\n\\nAfter Skunk Anansie split, Skin released her debut solo album \"Fleshwounds\". The album was toned down from her Skunk Anansie days and seemingly Skunk Anansie fans never took to it.  After releasing \"Fleshwounds\", Skin went on to perform various solo gigs around Europe. She was also support for the European leg of Robbie Williams\\' and Placebo\\'s world tours. After touring, she began to record her second album, \"Fake Chemical State\", which was released in March 2006, preceded by a new single \\'Just Let the Sun\\' on 6th March 2006. The first single from this album was \"Alone in My Room\", a download only track released on 7th November 2005. \"Alone in My Room\" was also the name given to Skin\\'s first UK solo tour in two years, which started in Berlin on 4th November, 2005.\\n\\nHer second album, Fake Chemical State, was released on 20th March 2006. She is currently working on her third, as well as touring with the reformed Skunk Anansie.\\n\\nSite: SkinMusic.net (official)\\n\\n2) A Swans side project, of Michael Gira and Jarboe. The first album: Blood, Women, Roses was released in 1987 and had Jarboe singing lead vocals with Gira doing occational backing vocals. This LP had cover versions of Cry Me a River and The Man I Love along with original material from the artists themselves. Later came 2 12\"s:  Girl: come out and One Thousand Years and in 1988 the 2nd LP Shame, Humility, Revenge was released, on which Gira provided lead vocals, with Jarboe doing backing vocals on several tracks. In 1990 they changed name to \\'The World of Skin\\', and released \\'Ten Songs For Another World\\' LP, in which both Gira and Jarboe provided lead vocals. There\\'s no significant difference between Skin and Swans, the music is the same in many senses. It could be said that the change to Skin marked a slight change in style of the music in that it became slower and more emotional.\\n\\n3) A British hard rock band, fronted by Neville MacDonald with Myke Gray on guitars, Dicki Fliszar on drums and Andy Robbins on bass.\\n\\nMembers: Neville McDonald (vocals), Myke Gray (guitar), Andy Robbins (bass), Dicki Fliszar (drums), and Colin McLeod (keyboards - 1994 to 96).\\n\\nSkin were formed in the early 1990s by ex-Jagged Edge members Myke Grey and Andy Robbins (also formerly of Tokyo Blade & Shogun) along with former Kooga vocalist Neville MacDonald and drummer Dicki Fliszar, formerly from Bruce Dickinson\\'s touring band and band Vamp. Originally called Taste, they went through a number of names as they played a smattering of small club dates throughout 1992. The band showed enough quality on these dates to be offered a management deal with Sanctuary Management, who also handled Iron Maiden and, ultimately, a record deal with Parlophone. Through Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, the band came to the attention of noted American producer Keith Olsen who offered to produce their debut at his \\'Goodnight LA\\' Studio. During 1993, the band flew to LA and began recording. Once the sessions were finished, the band listened to the finished product and decided more was needed so another three songs were recorded with Shay Baby producing.\\n\\nPrior to the release of the album, the band finally decided upon the name Skin (someone had written it down on a wall) and embarked upon a fourteen-date UK tour supporting Little Angels. Another support tour, this time with Thunder helped swell their growing fan base and, in 1993, they released their debut single The Skin Up EP. This was followed by House of Love before their first UK chart single \"Money\".\\n\\n1995 saw Skin consolidating their fan base by recording and releasing Live at the Borderline. A very limited edition CD of classic rock cover versions given away free with Kerrang! magazine, only 50 were available and it has become one of the most prized collectors items among Skin fans although a Japanese import version was released shortly after. In order to capitalise upon their appearance at Gateshead Stadium supporting Bon Jovi, the band also recorded and released Take Me Down to the River as a double CD along with some of the Borderline cuts.\\n\\nThe Bon Jovi appearance marked a high and low point in the career of Skin. A gig that would potentially give excellent exposure was marred by a fault with the band equipment as a voltage converter was incorrectly installed to USA settings by a stage tech which resulted in blowing Myke\\'s guitar amp and Colin\\'s hammond organ.\\n\\n1996 marked the first time that touring keyboard player Colin McLeod was featured in promotional artwork as well as the music video for single \"Perfect Day\". Despite this, Colin was a part time member as he wanted maintain a funk orientated direction he was continuing at the same time.\\n\\nNeither the second album, \"Lucky\" or the two singles, the first being \"How Lucky You Are\" and \"Perfect Day\" achieved the chart success of the debut album. The progression of British chart music at this time, along with the lack of backing for rock music in the mainstream media, led to the band being dropped by Parlophone.\\n\\nDespite this, Skin still held a Japanese record contract and the third album \"Big Fat Slice of Life\" was finished and released in 1997. Awaiting a UK release, the band released a self-financed two track CD single \"Degeneration\" that was distributed through the fan club. Later that same year they released their fourth, and final, studio album Experience Electric on Snapper Music. \"Experience...\" marked a revised version of the Japanese release with several tracks being reworked. \"Ride The Blue Wave\" evolved into the title track from the album, but \"Big Fat Slice...\" and \"Degeneration\" were omitted due to the fan club release. The album went on to top the indie charts at number 1.\\n\\nDuring this period, Skin toured relentlessly. The albums was shopped to several American record companies, and met with mogul Jonathan King. Following the culmination of the tour to promote the album, skin announced they would be emabarking on their farewell tour in 1998.\\n\\nThe final Skin concert at the LA2 in London, was recorded and released as a double live album Hasta La Vista, Baby! on Reef Records (a subset of Snapper Music). Since the band\\'s demise, a number of un-official releases have been issued featuring rare and unreleased tracks. These tracks combined of what would be the fifth UK album, and a large collection of demos that didn\\'t make it on the debut.\\n\\nIn March 2009 it was announced that Skin would reform to play the Download 2009 Festival.\\n\\nSite: SkinFreak.co.UK (official)\\n\\n4) A Japanese rock super-group (aka S.K.I.N.), with: former X JAPAN drummer [atist]Yoshik, former Malice Mizer vocalist Gackt, former Luna Sea guitarist Sugizo, and former Dué Le Quartz guitarist -miyavi-.\\n\\n5) An Australian four-piece percussion group, reflecting their country\\'s multicultural society. They take musical influences from Polynesia, Africa, Asia, and more, and create unique rhythms by experimenting with number patterns to make up rhythmic phrases. Some band members also play in Blue King Brown.\\n\\n6) A Richmond, Virginia, USA noise-rock band (aka The Skin), with a self titled CD out on CNP Records. The band is Alex Tomlin (La Mere Vipere, Battlemaster, Partyman),  Derek Tomlin (La Mere Vipere),  and Chris Conrad (The Amoeba Men, Seven Hearts) and each song on the CD has lead vocals with different guests including Danny Trice (La Mere Vipere, Leper Colony), Jason Hodges (The Amoeba Men, Suppression, Bermuda Triangles), John Chambers (Hallelujah!), and Andy Horn (Battlemaster, Cannabis Corpse).\\n\\n8) A post-punk group formed in the spring of 2015 in Flensburg, Germany. The quintet includes Leon Kraack (vocals, guitar), Lasse Jürgensen (vocals, guitar), Max Schumacher (bass), Meret Krasa (cello, synths) and Lennart Krasa (drums) who replaces the founding member Lennart Autzen. 2018 they published the EP \\'Shave My Eyelashes\\' and 2022 their debut album \\'Entertainment\\' at the german label Wimbleheim.\\n\\n9. A new wave/funk group from Boston, MA who released one album (Sanity) in 1987. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Skin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A german post-punk band from Flensburg.\\n9. A Boston, MA, USA new wave band.\\n\\n1) A pseudonym of British rock singer / guitarist Deborah Anne Dyer (b. 3rd Aug 1967, Brixton, London, England), lead vocalist with Skunk Anansie. Under this name, she débuted solo with the single \"Trashed\" (June 2003, EMI) and the latest is \"Tear Down These Houses\" (Dec 2007, Sony BMG Music Entertainment).\\n\\nAfter Skunk Anansie split, Skin released her debut solo album \"Fleshwounds\". The album was toned down from her Skunk Anansie days and seemingly Skunk Anansie fans never took to it.  After releasing \"Fleshwounds\", Skin went on to perform various solo gigs around Europe. She was also support for the European leg of Robbie Williams\\' and Placebo\\'s world tours. After touring, she began to record her second album, \"Fake Chemical State\", which was released in March 2006, preceded by a new single \\'Just Let the Sun\\' on 6th March 2006. The first single from this album was \"Alone in My Room\", a download only track released on 7th November 2005. \"Alone in My Room\" was also the name given to Skin\\'s first UK solo tour in two years, which started in Berlin on 4th November, 2005.\\n\\nHer second album, Fake Chemical State, was released on 20th March 2006. She is currently working on her third, as well as touring with the reformed Skunk Anansie.\\n\\nSite: SkinMusic.net (official)\\n\\n2) A Swans side project, of Michael Gira and Jarboe. The first album: Blood, Women, Roses was released in 1987 and had Jarboe singing lead vocals with Gira doing occational backing vocals. This LP had cover versions of Cry Me a River and The Man I Love along with original material from the artists themselves. Later came 2 12\"s:  Girl: come out and One Thousand Years and in 1988 the 2nd LP Shame, Humility, Revenge was released, on which Gira provided lead vocals, with Jarboe doing backing vocals on several tracks. In 1990 they changed name to \\'The World of Skin\\', and released \\'Ten Songs For Another World\\' LP, in which both Gira and Jarboe provided lead vocals. There\\'s no significant difference between Skin and Swans, the music is the same in many senses. It could be said that the change to Skin marked a slight change in style of the music in that it became slower and more emotional.\\n\\n3) A British hard rock band, fronted by Neville MacDonald with Myke Gray on guitars, Dicki Fliszar on drums and Andy Robbins on bass.\\n\\nMembers: Neville McDonald (vocals), Myke Gray (guitar), Andy Robbins (bass), Dicki Fliszar (drums), and Colin McLeod (keyboards - 1994 to 96).\\n\\nSkin were formed in the early 1990s by ex-Jagged Edge members Myke Grey and Andy Robbins (also formerly of Tokyo Blade & Shogun) along with former Kooga vocalist Neville MacDonald and drummer Dicki Fliszar, formerly from Bruce Dickinson\\'s touring band and band Vamp. Originally called Taste, they went through a number of names as they played a smattering of small club dates throughout 1992. The band showed enough quality on these dates to be offered a management deal with Sanctuary Management, who also handled Iron Maiden and, ultimately, a record deal with Parlophone. Through Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, the band came to the attention of noted American producer Keith Olsen who offered to produce their debut at his \\'Goodnight LA\\' Studio. During 1993, the band flew to LA and began recording. Once the sessions were finished, the band listened to the finished product and decided more was needed so another three songs were recorded with Shay Baby producing.\\n\\nPrior to the release of the album, the band finally decided upon the name Skin (someone had written it down on a wall) and embarked upon a fourteen-date UK tour supporting Little Angels. Another support tour, this time with Thunder helped swell their growing fan base and, in 1993, they released their debut single The Skin Up EP. This was followed by House of Love before their first UK chart single \"Money\".\\n\\n1995 saw Skin consolidating their fan base by recording and releasing Live at the Borderline. A very limited edition CD of classic rock cover versions given away free with Kerrang! magazine, only 50 were available and it has become one of the most prized collectors items among Skin fans although a Japanese import version was released shortly after. In order to capitalise upon their appearance at Gateshead Stadium supporting Bon Jovi, the band also recorded and released Take Me Down to the River as a double CD along with some of the Borderline cuts.\\n\\nThe Bon Jovi appearance marked a high and low point in the career of Skin. A gig that would potentially give excellent exposure was marred by a fault with the band equipment as a voltage converter was incorrectly installed to USA settings by a stage tech which resulted in blowing Myke\\'s guitar amp and Colin\\'s hammond organ.\\n\\n1996 marked the first time that touring keyboard player Colin McLeod was featured in promotional artwork as well as the music video for single \"Perfect Day\". Despite this, Colin was a part time member as he wanted maintain a funk orientated direction he was continuing at the same time.\\n\\nNeither the second album, \"Lucky\" or the two singles, the first being \"How Lucky You Are\" and \"Perfect Day\" achieved the chart success of the debut album. The progression of British chart music at this time, along with the lack of backing for rock music in the mainstream media, led to the band being dropped by Parlophone.\\n\\nDespite this, Skin still held a Japanese record contract and the third album \"Big Fat Slice of Life\" was finished and released in 1997. Awaiting a UK release, the band released a self-financed two track CD single \"Degeneration\" that was distributed through the fan club. Later that same year they released their fourth, and final, studio album Experience Electric on Snapper Music. \"Experience...\" marked a revised version of the Japanese release with several tracks being reworked. \"Ride The Blue Wave\" evolved into the title track from the album, but \"Big Fat Slice...\" and \"Degeneration\" were omitted due to the fan club release. The album went on to top the indie charts at number 1.\\n\\nDuring this period, Skin toured relentlessly. The albums was shopped to several American record companies, and met with mogul Jonathan King. Following the culmination of the tour to promote the album, skin announced they would be emabarking on their farewell tour in 1998.\\n\\nThe final Skin concert at the LA2 in London, was recorded and released as a double live album Hasta La Vista, Baby! on Reef Records (a subset of Snapper Music). Since the band\\'s demise, a number of un-official releases have been issued featuring rare and unreleased tracks. These tracks combined of what would be the fifth UK album, and a large collection of demos that didn\\'t make it on the debut.\\n\\nIn March 2009 it was announced that Skin would reform to play the Download 2009 Festival.\\n\\nSite: SkinFreak.co.UK (official)\\n\\n4) A Japanese rock super-group (aka S.K.I.N.), with: former X JAPAN drummer [atist]Yoshik, former Malice Mizer vocalist Gackt, former Luna Sea guitarist Sugizo, and former Dué Le Quartz guitarist -miyavi-.\\n\\n5) An Australian four-piece percussion group, reflecting their country\\'s multicultural society. They take musical influences from Polynesia, Africa, Asia, and more, and create unique rhythms by experimenting with number patterns to make up rhythmic phrases. Some band members also play in Blue King Brown.\\n\\n6) A Richmond, Virginia, USA noise-rock band (aka The Skin), with a self titled CD out on CNP Records. The band is Alex Tomlin (La Mere Vipere, Battlemaster, Partyman),  Derek Tomlin (La Mere Vipere),  and Chris Conrad (The Amoeba Men, Seven Hearts) and each song on the CD has lead vocals with different guests including Danny Trice (La Mere Vipere, Leper Colony), Jason Hodges (The Amoeba Men, Suppression, Bermuda Triangles), John Chambers (Hallelujah!), and Andy Horn (Battlemaster, Cannabis Corpse).\\n\\n8) A post-punk group formed in the spring of 2015 in Flensburg, Germany. The quintet includes Leon Kraack (vocals, guitar), Lasse Jürgensen (vocals, guitar), Max Schumacher (bass), Meret Krasa (cello, synths) and Lennart Krasa (drums) who replaces the founding member Lennart Autzen. 2018 they published the EP \\'Shave My Eyelashes\\' and 2022 their debut album \\'Entertainment\\' at the german label Wimbleheim.\\n\\n9. A new wave/funk group from Boston, MA who released one album (Sanity) in 1987. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Skin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "“I see myself as an artist more than a musician, not only because I play guitar worse than a deaf camel, but because being in a band has always required a lot more skills than just songwriting and singing,” says Skin. “You have to dip your fingers in other art forms (like film, theatre, books) in order to create something wonderful from the clash of egos which are part of being in a great band.”\n\nSkin is one of Britain’s leading female rock singers. She is also a fashion icon, a renowned DJ, a charity activist, and an inspiring role model for different generations of fans. Born and brought up in Brixton, south London, she defied expectations as a black woman vocalist by diving headlong into hardcore rock, rather than becoming a soul session singer. Since she emerged in the early ‘90s with Skunk Anansie, Skin has been a groundbreaking presence. “I’m not up there trying to be a babe. I’m sexual but not in a girly, wimpy way. Our music has attitude, it’s in yer face, so I have my own parameters,” she said in 1995.\n\nIn 1992 Skin gave up her career as an interior designer to write songs and devote herself to music. She played in bands on the North London indie scene before joining forces with bass player Cass and guitarist Ace to form Skunk Anansie (so-called after the West African folk tales of Anansi, the spider man). The group played their first gig at London's Splash club in 1994 and within a year were voted Best New British Band by the readers of Kerrang! Magazine. After the award ceremony drummer Mark Richardson joined the band as their permanent drummer.\n\nA multi-racial band with a sound that collides brooding, funky beats with edgy lyrics, driving riffs and fragile ballads, Skunk Anansie broke barriers from the start. When someone once asked her about Brit-rock, Skin jokingly replied: “We’re more clit-rock than Brit-rock”, and the term “clit-rock” was then celebrated as an alternative to macho “cock rock”. By 1995 the group appeared with two of their songs, ‘Feed’ and ‘Selling Jesus’, on the soundtrack of the Kathryn Bigelow film Strange Days. After hearing the song ‘Selling Jesus’, radio ‘shock jock’ Howard Stern predicted that the band would become huge. In 1996 they were voted Kerrang!'s Best British Live Act and the following year they were nominated for Best Live Act and Best Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nIn the ‘90s Skunk Anansie dominated the album charts with Paranoid and Sunburnt  (1995), Stoosh (1995) and Post Orgasmic Chill (1996). They had a succession of hit singles including the devastating ballads ‘Brazen (Weep)’, ‘Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good)’, and ‘Weak’, where, with her rich, soulful voice Skin seemed to reach deep inside to draw out powerful emotion. There’s also her personal favourite, ‘Secretly’. “You should have been by yourself/Instead of here with me...secretly,”  she sang with operatic intensity, sounding like a collision between Robert Plant and Martha Wainwright.\n\nSkunk Anansie toured globally with such acts as U2, Aerosmith, Lenny Kravitz, Veruca Salt, and Rammstein, and headlined Glastonbury in 1999. In 2001 however, they split up. “We’d burned ourselves out by working too hard. We were touring and recording constantly, all living separate lives. The chemistry and spirit disappeared. It’s not rock-by-numbers - you have to feel it,” says Skin.\n\nShe launched a solo career, releasing and touring the albums Fleshwounds in 2003 and Fake Chemical State in 2006. Spawning the hit single ‘Trashed’, Fleshwounds was a pared-down, soulful album. Skin describes it as “very down-tempo. That was my mood at the time, I was sad and melancholy, I’d had a relationship that fell apart.”  Fake Chemical State  saw her in a more upbeat, mischievous mood. “That album was happier, rock-tastic. I was on my way back to Skunk Anansie, to myself.”\n\nThe band got back together, and in April 2009 played two shows at London Water Rats (former Splash Club and the place where they’d started). The gigs sold out in five minutes. That year they released the ‘greatest hits’ album Smashes & Trashes (which included three new tracks and a Remix collection) and did a sell-out European tour. “It’s been very natural and unforced - a bit like coming home. We have a huge fanbase that’s been screaming out for us to do some work,” Skin said of their reunion. “We got back together because we have a strong chemistry. It’s all about the future for us, not the past.” Fired up by their tour the band went into the studio in spring 2010 and recorded their fourth album Wonderlustre, a set that flows from soaring and elegaic to  locked-down, sensual and funky. Released in September 2010, the album includes the declarative single ‘My Ugly Boy’ (which was featured exclusively on Kerrang.com) and the gothic, slow-burning ‘My Love Will Fall’.\n\nAs well as fronting one of the UK’s key bands, Skin is a multi-talented artist involved in varied projects. She is also an established DJ, playing “tech house, minimal, and then I’ll throw on a rock record in the middle to fuck everybody up!” She has played out at classic venues like Club Q in Zurich, with such DJs as Martin Buttrich, Clive Henry and Smokin Jo, Luciano.\n\nShe has contributed guest vocals to numerous projects, including ‘Carmen Queasy’ from Maxim (from the Prodigy’s) solo album Hell’s Kitchen, and ‘Meat’ from Tony Iommi’s album Iommi. Her 2008 song ‘Tear Down These Houses’ featured on the soundtrack to Silvio Muccino’s film Parlami d'Amore, and was nominated for an Italian Oscar.\n\nWith her trademark bald head and striking image, Skin has also become a muse for key photographers like Mario Testino, Nick Knight and Derek Santini. She has modeled for top fashion designers, wearing Alexander McQueen for Fashion Rocks in 2003, and then Gucci in 2005. She has also modeled for Gianfranco Ferre and the Italian couture designer Liborio Capizzi. “I love fashion. It’s an art form,” says Skin. “If you’re the lead singer of a rock band you have your picture taken non-stop, and it’s interesting to develop the visual side. I’m not typical fashion, a blank canvas. I come with personality, a canvas with lots of colours!\n\nAnd away from the limelight, Skin does a lot of charity work. She has been involved with The Medical Foundation and the Baobab Foundation, charities that focus on torture victims and asylum seekers. “I have done music therapy with asylum seekers and help them integrate into society. I’ve worked with young people who come to this country with no papers, some have been pulled from rape camps, some are child soldiers. They’ve been through so much.” She is also actively involved in the global campaign against genital mutilation. “It is a basic human right for women of all cutlures to hold and express our sexuality and keep/control the heart of our womanhood” she asserts.\n\nSo Skin remains a pivotal force in music - not just as a rock singer but also as and cultural icon. Continually pushing boundaries, she proves that one’s potential can be limitless. From the beginning she forged her own way. As she says: “A bit of anger can be very useful in the right place and time, it gives you sparks, gets you moving, feeds your passion, separates the girls from the toys!”",

      "bio_content": "There are at least eight artists that use this name:\n1. A pseudonym of British rock singer/guitarist Deborah Anne Dyer, lead singer of Skunk Anansie.\n2. A Swans side project, of Michael Gira and Jarboe.\n3. A British hard rock band.\n4. A Japanese rock super-group (aka S.K.I.N.).\n5. An Australian four piece percussion group.\n6. A Richmond, VA, USA noise rock band.\n7. A Venezuelan alternative indie rock girl band.\n8. A german post-punk band from Flensburg.\n9. A Boston, MA, USA new wave band.\n\n1) A pseudonym of British rock singer / guitarist Deborah Anne Dyer (b. 3rd Aug 1967, Brixton, London, England), lead vocalist with Skunk Anansie. Under this name, she débuted solo with the single \"Trashed\" (June 2003, EMI) and the latest is \"Tear Down These Houses\" (Dec 2007, Sony BMG Music Entertainment).\n\nAfter Skunk Anansie split, Skin released her debut solo album \"Fleshwounds\". The album was toned down from her Skunk Anansie days and seemingly Skunk Anansie fans never took to it.  After releasing \"Fleshwounds\", Skin went on to perform various solo gigs around Europe. She was also support for the European leg of Robbie Williams' and Placebo's world tours. After touring, she began to record her second album, \"Fake Chemical State\", which was released in March 2006, preceded by a new single 'Just Let the Sun' on 6th March 2006. The first single from this album was \"Alone in My Room\", a download only track released on 7th November 2005. \"Alone in My Room\" was also the name given to Skin's first UK solo tour in two years, which started in Berlin on 4th November, 2005.\n\nHer second album, Fake Chemical State, was released on 20th March 2006. She is currently working on her third, as well as touring with the reformed Skunk Anansie.\n\nSite: SkinMusic.net (official)\n\n2) A Swans side project, of Michael Gira and Jarboe. The first album: Blood, Women, Roses was released in 1987 and had Jarboe singing lead vocals with Gira doing occational backing vocals. This LP had cover versions of Cry Me a River and The Man I Love along with original material from the artists themselves. Later came 2 12\"s:  Girl: come out and One Thousand Years and in 1988 the 2nd LP Shame, Humility, Revenge was released, on which Gira provided lead vocals, with Jarboe doing backing vocals on several tracks. In 1990 they changed name to 'The World of Skin', and released 'Ten Songs For Another World' LP, in which both Gira and Jarboe provided lead vocals. There's no significant difference between Skin and Swans, the music is the same in many senses. It could be said that the change to Skin marked a slight change in style of the music in that it became slower and more emotional.\n\n3) A British hard rock band, fronted by Neville MacDonald with Myke Gray on guitars, Dicki Fliszar on drums and Andy Robbins on bass.\n\nMembers: Neville McDonald (vocals), Myke Gray (guitar), Andy Robbins (bass), Dicki Fliszar (drums), and Colin McLeod (keyboards - 1994 to 96).\n\nSkin were formed in the early 1990s by ex-Jagged Edge members Myke Grey and Andy Robbins (also formerly of Tokyo Blade & Shogun) along with former Kooga vocalist Neville MacDonald and drummer Dicki Fliszar, formerly from Bruce Dickinson's touring band and band Vamp. Originally called Taste, they went through a number of names as they played a smattering of small club dates throughout 1992. The band showed enough quality on these dates to be offered a management deal with Sanctuary Management, who also handled Iron Maiden and, ultimately, a record deal with Parlophone. Through Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, the band came to the attention of noted American producer Keith Olsen who offered to produce their debut at his 'Goodnight LA' Studio. During 1993, the band flew to LA and began recording. Once the sessions were finished, the band listened to the finished product and decided more was needed so another three songs were recorded with Shay Baby producing.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, the band finally decided upon the name Skin (someone had written it down on a wall) and embarked upon a fourteen-date UK tour supporting Little Angels. Another support tour, this time with Thunder helped swell their growing fan base and, in 1993, they released their debut single The Skin Up EP. This was followed by House of Love before their first UK chart single \"Money\".\n\n1995 saw Skin consolidating their fan base by recording and releasing Live at the Borderline. A very limited edition CD of classic rock cover versions given away free with Kerrang! magazine, only 50 were available and it has become one of the most prized collectors items among Skin fans although a Japanese import version was released shortly after. In order to capitalise upon their appearance at Gateshead Stadium supporting Bon Jovi, the band also recorded and released Take Me Down to the River as a double CD along with some of the Borderline cuts.\n\nThe Bon Jovi appearance marked a high and low point in the career of Skin. A gig that would potentially give excellent exposure was marred by a fault with the band equipment as a voltage converter was incorrectly installed to USA settings by a stage tech which resulted in blowing Myke's guitar amp and Colin's hammond organ.\n\n1996 marked the first time that touring keyboard player Colin McLeod was featured in promotional artwork as well as the music video for single \"Perfect Day\". Despite this, Colin was a part time member as he wanted maintain a funk orientated direction he was continuing at the same time.\n\nNeither the second album, \"Lucky\" or the two singles, the first being \"How Lucky You Are\" and \"Perfect Day\" achieved the chart success of the debut album. The progression of British chart music at this time, along with the lack of backing for rock music in the mainstream media, led to the band being dropped by Parlophone.\n\nDespite this, Skin still held a Japanese record contract and the third album \"Big Fat Slice of Life\" was finished and released in 1997. Awaiting a UK release, the band released a self-financed two track CD single \"Degeneration\" that was distributed through the fan club. Later that same year they released their fourth, and final, studio album Experience Electric on Snapper Music. \"Experience...\" marked a revised version of the Japanese release with several tracks being reworked. \"Ride The Blue Wave\" evolved into the title track from the album, but \"Big Fat Slice...\" and \"Degeneration\" were omitted due to the fan club release. The album went on to top the indie charts at number 1.\n\nDuring this period, Skin toured relentlessly. The albums was shopped to several American record companies, and met with mogul Jonathan King. Following the culmination of the tour to promote the album, skin announced they would be emabarking on their farewell tour in 1998.\n\nThe final Skin concert at the LA2 in London, was recorded and released as a double live album Hasta La Vista, Baby! on Reef Records (a subset of Snapper Music). Since the band's demise, a number of un-official releases have been issued featuring rare and unreleased tracks. These tracks combined of what would be the fifth UK album, and a large collection of demos that didn't make it on the debut.\n\nIn March 2009 it was announced that Skin would reform to play the Download 2009 Festival.\n\nSite: SkinFreak.co.UK (official)\n\n4) A Japanese rock super-group (aka S.K.I.N.), with: former X JAPAN drummer [atist]Yoshik, former Malice Mizer vocalist Gackt, former Luna Sea guitarist Sugizo, and former Dué Le Quartz guitarist -miyavi-.\n\n5) An Australian four-piece percussion group, reflecting their country's multicultural society. They take musical influences from Polynesia, Africa, Asia, and more, and create unique rhythms by experimenting with number patterns to make up rhythmic phrases. Some band members also play in Blue King Brown.\n\n6) A Richmond, Virginia, USA noise-rock band (aka The Skin), with a self titled CD out on CNP Records. The band is Alex Tomlin (La Mere Vipere, Battlemaster, Partyman),  Derek Tomlin (La Mere Vipere),  and Chris Conrad (The Amoeba Men, Seven Hearts) and each song on the CD has lead vocals with different guests including Danny Trice (La Mere Vipere, Leper Colony), Jason Hodges (The Amoeba Men, Suppression, Bermuda Triangles), John Chambers (Hallelujah!), and Andy Horn (Battlemaster, Cannabis Corpse).\n\n8) A post-punk group formed in the spring of 2015 in Flensburg, Germany. The quintet includes Leon Kraack (vocals, guitar), Lasse Jürgensen (vocals, guitar), Max Schumacher (bass), Meret Krasa (cello, synths) and Lennart Krasa (drums) who replaces the founding member Lennart Autzen. 2018 they published the EP 'Shave My Eyelashes' and 2022 their debut album 'Entertainment' at the german label Wimbleheim.\n\n9.

      "biography_en": "“I see myself as an artist more than a musician, not only because I play guitar worse than a deaf camel, but because being in a band has always required a lot more skills than just songwriting and singing,” says Skin. “You have to dip your fingers in other art forms (like film, theatre, books) in order to create something wonderful from the clash of egos which are part of being in a great band.”\n\nSkin is one of Britain’s leading female rock singers. She is also a fashion icon, a renowned DJ, a charity activist, and an inspiring role model for different generations of fans. Born and brought up in Brixton, south London, she defied expectations as a black woman vocalist by diving headlong into hardcore rock, rather than becoming a soul session singer. Since she emerged in the early ‘90s with Skunk Anansie, Skin has been a groundbreaking presence. “I’m not up there trying to be a babe. I’m sexual but not in a girly, wimpy way. Our music has attitude, it’s in yer face, so I have my own parameters,” she said in 1995.\n\nIn 1992 Skin gave up her career as an interior designer to write songs and devote herself to music. She played in bands on the North London indie scene before joining forces with bass player Cass and guitarist Ace to form Skunk Anansie (so-called after the West African folk tales of Anansi, the spider man). The group played their first gig at London's Splash club in 1994 and within a year were voted Best New British Band by the readers of Kerrang! Magazine. After the award ceremony drummer Mark Richardson joined the band as their permanent drummer.\n\nA multi-racial band with a sound that collides brooding, funky beats with edgy lyrics, driving riffs and fragile ballads, Skunk Anansie broke barriers from the start. When someone once asked her about Brit-rock, Skin jokingly replied: “We’re more clit-rock than Brit-rock”, and the term “clit-rock” was then celebrated as an alternative to macho “cock rock”. By 1995 the group appeared with two of their songs, ‘Feed’ and ‘Selling Jesus’, on the soundtrack of the Kathryn Bigelow film Strange Days. After hearing the song ‘Selling Jesus’, radio ‘shock jock’ Howard Stern predicted that the band would become huge. In 1996 they were voted Kerrang!'s Best British Live Act and the following year they were nominated for Best Live Act and Best Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nIn the ‘90s Skunk Anansie dominated the album charts with Paranoid and Sunburnt  (1995), Stoosh (1995) and Post Orgasmic Chill (1996). They had a succession of hit singles including the devastating ballads ‘Brazen (Weep)’, ‘Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good)’, and ‘Weak’, where, with her rich, soulful voice Skin seemed to reach deep inside to draw out powerful emotion. There’s also her personal favourite, ‘Secretly’. “You should have been by yourself/Instead of here with me...secretly,”  she sang with operatic intensity, sounding like a collision between Robert Plant and Martha Wainwright.\n\nSkunk Anansie toured globally with such acts as U2, Aerosmith, Lenny Kravitz, Veruca Salt, and Rammstein, and headlined Glastonbury in 1999. In 2001 however, they split up. “We’d burned ourselves out by working too hard. We were touring and recording constantly, all living separate lives. The chemistry and spirit disappeared. It’s not rock-by-numbers - you have to feel it,” says Skin.\n\nShe launched a solo career, releasing and touring the albums Fleshwounds in 2003 and Fake Chemical State in 2006. Spawning the hit single ‘Trashed’, Fleshwounds was a pared-down, soulful album. Skin describes it as “very down-tempo. That was my mood at the time, I was sad and melancholy, I’d had a relationship that fell apart.”  Fake Chemical State  saw her in a more upbeat, mischievous mood. “That album was happier, rock-tastic. I was on my way back to Skunk Anansie, to myself.”\n\nThe band got back together, and in April 2009 played two shows at London Water Rats (former Splash Club and the place where they’d started). The gigs sold out in five minutes. That year they released the ‘greatest hits’ album Smashes & Trashes (which included three new tracks and a Remix collection) and did a sell-out European tour. “It’s been very natural and unforced - a bit like coming home. We have a huge fanbase that’s been screaming out for us to do some work,” Skin said of their reunion. “We got back together because we have a strong chemistry. It’s all about the future for us, not the past.” Fired up by their tour the band went into the studio in spring 2010 and recorded their fourth album Wonderlustre, a set that flows from soaring and elegaic to  locked-down, sensual and funky. Released in September 2010, the album includes the declarative single ‘My Ugly Boy’ (which was featured exclusively on Kerrang.com) and the gothic, slow-burning ‘My Love Will Fall’.\n\nAs well as fronting one of the UK’s key bands, Skin is a multi-talented artist involved in varied projects. She is also an established DJ, playing “tech house, minimal, and then I’ll throw on a rock record in the middle to fuck everybody up!” She has played out at classic venues like Club Q in Zurich, with such DJs as Martin Buttrich, Clive Henry and Smokin Jo, Luciano.\n\nShe has contributed guest vocals to numerous projects, including ‘Carmen Queasy’ from Maxim (from the Prodigy’s) solo album Hell’s Kitchen, and ‘Meat’ from Tony Iommi’s album Iommi. Her 2008 song ‘Tear Down These Houses’ featured on the soundtrack to Silvio Muccino’s film Parlami d'Amore, and was nominated for an Italian Oscar.\n\nWith her trademark bald head and striking image, Skin has also become a muse for key photographers like Mario Testino, Nick Knight and Derek Santini. She has modeled for top fashion designers, wearing Alexander McQueen for Fashion Rocks in 2003, and then Gucci in 2005. She has also modeled for Gianfranco Ferre and the Italian couture designer Liborio Capizzi. “I love fashion. It’s an art form,” says Skin. “If you’re the lead singer of a rock band you have your picture taken non-stop, and it’s interesting to develop the visual side. I’m not typical fashion, a blank canvas. I come with personality, a canvas with lots of colours!\n\nAnd away from the limelight, Skin does a lot of charity work. She has been involved with The Medical Foundation and the Baobab Foundation, charities that focus on torture victims and asylum seekers. “I have done music therapy with asylum seekers and help them integrate into society. I’ve worked with young people who come to this country with no papers, some have been pulled from rape camps, some are child soldiers. They’ve been through so much.” She is also actively involved in the global campaign against genital mutilation. “It is a basic human right for women of all cutlures to hold and express our sexuality and keep/control the heart of our womanhood” she asserts.\n\nSo Skin remains a pivotal force in music - not just as a rock singer but also as and cultural icon. Continually pushing boundaries, she proves that one’s potential can be limitless. From the beginning she forged her own way. As she says: “A bit of anger can be very useful in the right place and time, it gives you sparks, gets you moving, feeds your passion, separates the girls from the toys!”",
