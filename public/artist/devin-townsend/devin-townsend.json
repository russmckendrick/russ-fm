  "biography": "Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician and record producer from New Westminster, British Columbia. He was the founder, songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist in extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad from 1994 to 2007 and has had an extensive career as a solo artist, in which his work usually leans more towards a progressive metal style.\n\nAfter performing in a number of metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on a solo album released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records. Townsend's solo albums, a diverse mix of hard rock and progressive metal, have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed The Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases.\n\nIn 2007, Townsend disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began work on a four-album series called The Devin Townsend Project, with each album written in a different style. The first two entries in the series, Ki and Addicted, were released in 2009. Townsend scheduled tours throughout Australia and North America in 2010 in support of the albums, and released the next two, Deconstruction and Ghost, in 2011.\n\nTownsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound, has been compared to the styles of Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Devin+Townsend\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "profile": "Born on May 5th 1972 in Vancouver, Canada, Devin Townsend is a multi-instrumentalist and producer. At the age of 19, he caught the attention of Steve Vai, who recruited him as the vocalist in his band, Vai, for the \"Sex & Religion\" album and consequent world tour. Since then, he spent his career in projects he started himself, as an expression of the different \"sides\" of his creativity: the two main projects are Strapping Young Lad (a speed/industrial metal band), and Devin Townsend/the Devin Townsend Band/Devin Townsend Project.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing 4 studio albums and 1 live album under the name Devin Townsend (Ocean Machine Biomech, Infinity, the live album Official Bootleg, Physicist, and Terria), Devin changed the band name to The Devin Townsend Band to reflect his first stable lineup of backing musicians. Releasing 2 albums under that band name (Accelerated Evolution and Synchestra) and 3 side albums under the Devin Townsend name (Devlab, The Hummer, and the comedic concept album Ziltoid The Omniscient) he eventually announced Ziltoid might be his final album. He came back 2 years later with a new band name Devin Townsend Project and the start of a 4 album cycle (Ki, Addicted!, Deconstruction, and Ghost) which were released 2009-2011. Following this up with 4 more albums (Epicloud, Z2/Dark Matters (a Ziltoid sequel), Sky Blue, and Transcendence), he announced in 2018 that he would be dropping the Devin Townsend Project band name. 2019's release (Empath) saw him once more using the band name Devin Townsend.",

        "profile": "Born on May 5th 1972 in Vancouver, Canada, Devin Townsend is a multi-instrumentalist and producer. At the age of 19, he caught the attention of Steve Vai, who recruited him as the vocalist in his band, Vai, for the \"Sex & Religion\" album and consequent world tour. Since then, he spent his career in projects he started himself, as an expression of the different \"sides\" of his creativity: the two main projects are Strapping Young Lad (a speed/industrial metal band), and Devin Townsend/the Devin Townsend Band/Devin Townsend Project.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing 4 studio albums and 1 live album under the name Devin Townsend (Ocean Machine Biomech, Infinity, the live album Official Bootleg, Physicist, and Terria), Devin changed the band name to The Devin Townsend Band to reflect his first stable lineup of backing musicians. Releasing 2 albums under that band name (Accelerated Evolution and Synchestra) and 3 side albums under the Devin Townsend name (Devlab, The Hummer, and the comedic concept album Ziltoid The Omniscient) he eventually announced Ziltoid might be his final album. He came back 2 years later with a new band name Devin Townsend Project and the start of a 4 album cycle (Ki, Addicted!, Deconstruction, and Ghost) which were released 2009-2011. Following this up with 4 more albums (Epicloud, Z2/Dark Matters (a Ziltoid sequel), Sky Blue, and Transcendence), he announced in 2018 that he would be dropping the Devin Townsend Project band name. 2019's release (Empath) saw him once more using the band name Devin Townsend.",

      "bio_content": "Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician and record producer from New Westminster, British Columbia. He was the founder, songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist in extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad from 1994 to 2007 and has had an extensive career as a solo artist, in which his work usually leans more towards a progressive metal style.\n\nAfter performing in a number of metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on a solo album released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records. Townsend's solo albums, a diverse mix of hard rock and progressive metal, have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed The Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases.\n\nIn 2007, Townsend disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began work on a four-album series called The Devin Townsend Project, with each album written in a different style. The first two entries in the series, Ki and Addicted, were released in 2009. Townsend scheduled tours throughout Australia and North America in 2010 in support of the albums, and released the next two, Deconstruction and Ghost, in 2011.\n\nTownsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound, has been compared to the styles of Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Devin+Townsend\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
