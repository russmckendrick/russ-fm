  "biography": "The Sea Nymphs were an English psychedelic folk band from Kingston upon Thames, England, a side project by Tim Smith, Sarah Smith, and William D. Drake of the band Cardiacs. Their musical style is much lighter than that of their parent outfit, Cardiacs; the songs dispense with the use of loud guitars and drums, in favour of differing vocal rhythms, keyboards and brass instruments. However, the music still contains Cardiacs' trademark off-the-wall chord progressions and sudden time changes, albeit in a slightly gentler fashion.\n\nThe group formed under the title Mr and Mrs Smith and Mr Drake, releasing a self-titled album in 1984. In 1991, group reunited and changed their name to The Sea Nymphs. They made their single debut with \"Appealing to Venus\" (1991), preceding their eponymous debut album (1992). Tim Smith suffered a cardiac arrest in 2008, limiting his mobility and temporarily causing the group to go on hiatus before returning to the studio in 2015 to complete the Sea Nymphs' second album On the Dry Land (2016), which was recorded around the same time as their debut in the 1990s but unfinished until that point. Tim Smith passed away from another heart attack in July 2020. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sea+Nymphs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
