  "biography": "Rick James (born James Ambrose Johnson, Jr.; February 1, 1948 – August 6, 2004) was an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer, best known for being the major popularizer of funk music in the late 1970s and early 1980s thanks to million-selling hits such as \"You and I\" (1978), \"Give It to Me Baby\" (1981) and \"Super Freak\" (1981), the latter song crossing him over to pop audiences and selling over three million copies, later contributing to the success of rapper MC Hammer's \"U Can't Touch This\" (1990), for whom James sued in order to be credited. James won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song with Hammer for the song, his only Grammy win.\nJames started his singing career fronting doo-wop and rhythm and blues bands in his hometown of Buffalo, New York in the early 1960s, with his vocal style influenced by the likes of Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and David Ruffin. After entering the United States Navy to avoid conscription after he dropped out of high school, James went AWOL and relocated to Toronto, Canada where he resumed his music career. While there, James formed the rock-soul fusion band Mynah Birds, whose lineup once included a young Neil Young. James' tenure with the Mynah Birds was interrupted after he was discovered recording with the group in Motown in the 1960s and surrendered to authorities serving out a one-year sentence in a prison in Buffalo. James returned to Canada where he resumed the Mynah Birds though the band eventually split and James relocated to California where he started a series of rock bands. He also had a period where he served as a staff writer with Motown under an assumed name before he left the label.\nIn 1978, he signed with the Gordy Records subsidiary of Motown as a recording artist where in 1978, he recorded his first album, Come Get It!, which sold over a million copies at the time of its release. He would go on to score several popular hits on the pop and R&B charts, including four number-one hits on the latter chart. James became noted not only as a hit maker on his own recordings but also produced successful recordings for the likes of Teena Marie, The Mary Jane Girls, The Temptations, Eddie Murphy and Smokey Robinson. His best-selling recording, 1981's Street Songs, sold over three million copies helping to renew sagging fortunes in Motown.\nAddictions to cocaine and crack however hampered his career by the late eighties and in the nineties, his legal troubles, which would include assaulting two women while under the influence of crack, led him to serve a three-year prison sentence at California's Folsom State Prison. James was released on parole in 1996 and resumed his musical career releasing the album, Urban Rapsody, in 1997. A mild stroke suffered during a concert in early 1998 interrupted his career for a brief time. James received new notoriety in 2004 when he appeared on an episode of Dave Chappelle's Chappelle Show in the Charlie Murphy \"True Hollywood Stories\" segment of the show, in which James' past wild lifestyle was satirized. James died later that year from heart failure at the age of 56.",

He also formed the blues band The Main Line, and was singing and writing in [a=The Great White Cane]. \r\n\r\nIn 1977 he formed the [a=Stone City Band]. His first album “Come Get It,” reached position #3 on the R&B charts, “You and I,” went gold in September and “Mary Jane,\" a barely-disguised hymn to marijuana, hit US R&B #3 in October 1977. He also helped launch the [a=Mary Jane Girls] in the mid-1980s. Rick James is also credited for establishing the “Punk Funk,” style. \r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 6th, 2004, James was found dead in his Burbank, California home. He died from pulmonary and cardiac failure with his various health conditions of diabetes, stroke, a pacemaker and a heart attack.",

He also formed the blues band The Main Line, and was singing and writing in [a=The Great White Cane]. \r\n\r\nIn 1977 he formed the [a=Stone City Band]. His first album “Come Get It,” reached position #3 on the R&B charts, “You and I,” went gold in September and “Mary Jane,\" a barely-disguised hymn to marijuana, hit US R&B #3 in October 1977. He also helped launch the [a=Mary Jane Girls] in the mid-1980s.

      "biography_en": "Rick James (born James Ambrose Johnson, Jr.; February 1, 1948 – August 6, 2004) was an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer, best known for being the major popularizer of funk music in the late 1970s and early 1980s thanks to million-selling hits such as \"You and I\" (1978), \"Give It to Me Baby\" (1981) and \"Super Freak\" (1981), the latter song crossing him over to pop audiences and selling over three million copies, later contributing to the success of rapper MC Hammer's \"U Can't Touch This\" (1990), for whom James sued in order to be credited. James won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song with Hammer for the song, his only Grammy win.\nJames started his singing career fronting doo-wop and rhythm and blues bands in his hometown of Buffalo, New York in the early 1960s, with his vocal style influenced by the likes of Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and David Ruffin. After entering the United States Navy to avoid conscription after he dropped out of high school, James went AWOL and relocated to Toronto, Canada where he resumed his music career. While there, James formed the rock-soul fusion band Mynah Birds, whose lineup once included a young Neil Young. James' tenure with the Mynah Birds was interrupted after he was discovered recording with the group in Motown in the 1960s and surrendered to authorities serving out a one-year sentence in a prison in Buffalo. James returned to Canada where he resumed the Mynah Birds though the band eventually split and James relocated to California where he started a series of rock bands. He also had a period where he served as a staff writer with Motown under an assumed name before he left the label.\nIn 1978, he signed with the Gordy Records subsidiary of Motown as a recording artist where in 1978, he recorded his first album, Come Get It!, which sold over a million copies at the time of its release. He would go on to score several popular hits on the pop and R&B charts, including four number-one hits on the latter chart. James became noted not only as a hit maker on his own recordings but also produced successful recordings for the likes of Teena Marie, The Mary Jane Girls, The Temptations, Eddie Murphy and Smokey Robinson. His best-selling recording, 1981's Street Songs, sold over three million copies helping to renew sagging fortunes in Motown.\nAddictions to cocaine and crack however hampered his career by the late eighties and in the nineties, his legal troubles, which would include assaulting two women while under the influence of crack, led him to serve a three-year prison sentence at California's Folsom State Prison. James was released on parole in 1996 and resumed his musical career releasing the album, Urban Rapsody, in 1997. A mild stroke suffered during a concert in early 1998 interrupted his career for a brief time. James received new notoriety in 2004 when he appeared on an episode of Dave Chappelle's Chappelle Show in the Charlie Murphy \"True Hollywood Stories\" segment of the show, in which James' past wild lifestyle was satirized. James died later that year from heart failure at the age of 56.",

      "bio_content": "Rick James (born James Ambrose Johnson, Jr; February 1, 1948 - August 6, 2004) was an American funk and soul musician from Buffalo New York, who worked as a singer, keyboardist, bassist, record producer, arranger, and composer during his long career. One of the most popular artists on the Motown label during the late 1970s and early 1980s, James was famous for his wild brand of funk music and his trademark cornrow braids. As time went on, James was given the unofficial title The King of Punk-Funk.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school and joining the US Naval Reserve, he eventually went AWOL to concentrate on music. He fled to Canada in 1964 and started using the name Ricky Matthews. In Toronto, he led various incarnations of The Mynah Birds, some of which included Neil Young and Bruce Palmer (who would go on to form Buffalo Springfield) and Nick St. Nicholas (later of Steppenwolf). After scoring a deal with Motown, the band was swindled by their manager and the label discovered James was on the lam, and the band split up.\n\nAfter serving time for desertion, James tried to rekindle the Mynah Birds, but eventually found a role as a writer and producer at Motown, using the name Terry Johnson on tunes for Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers and The Spinners. He moved to California in 1969 and formed Salt 'n' Pepper (not to be confused with Salt-N-Pepa) and worked with a number of bands (Heaven and Earth, Great White Cane, and Stone City Band) before returning to Motown, where he developed the gritty funk sound that would bring him hits and notoriety. \"Super Freak\" in 1981, from the Street Songs album, was his biggest hit. During this period, he also helped launch the careers of R&B singer Teena Marie and the Mary Jane Girls as well as producing Eddie Murphy's hit, Party All the Time.\n\nAfter remaining moderately successful through the 80s, his popularity waned in the 90s and he succumbed to drugs, having frequent run-ins with the law, one of which resulted in a prison term. After an unsuccessful comeback attempt in 1997 and suffering a stroke, James retired. He died in 2004 from heart failure with multiple contributing factors. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rick+James\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "Rick James (born James Ambrose Johnson, Jr.; February 1, 1948 – August 6, 2004) was an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer, best known for being the major popularizer of funk music in the late 1970s and early 1980s thanks to million-selling hits such as \"You and I\" (1978), \"Give It to Me Baby\" (1981) and \"Super Freak\" (1981), the latter song crossing him over to pop audiences and selling over three million copies, later contributing to the success of rapper MC Hammer's \"U Can't Touch This\" (1990), for whom James sued in order to be credited. James won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song with Hammer for the song, his only Grammy win.\nJames started his singing career fronting doo-wop and rhythm and blues bands in his hometown of Buffalo, New York in the early 1960s, with his vocal style influenced by the likes of Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and David Ruffin. After entering the United States Navy to avoid conscription after he dropped out of high school, James went AWOL and relocated to Toronto, Canada where he resumed his music career. While there, James formed the rock-soul fusion band Mynah Birds, whose lineup once included a young Neil Young. James' tenure with the Mynah Birds was interrupted after he was discovered recording with the group in Motown in the 1960s and surrendered to authorities serving out a one-year sentence in a prison in Buffalo. James returned to Canada where he resumed the Mynah Birds though the band eventually split and James relocated to California where he started a series of rock bands. He also had a period where he served as a staff writer with Motown under an assumed name before he left the label.\nIn 1978, he signed with the Gordy Records subsidiary of Motown as a recording artist where in 1978, he recorded his first album, Come Get It!, which sold over a million copies at the time of its release. He would go on to score several popular hits on the pop and R&B charts, including four number-one hits on the latter chart. James became noted not only as a hit maker on his own recordings but also produced successful recordings for the likes of Teena Marie, The Mary Jane Girls, The Temptations, Eddie Murphy and Smokey Robinson. His best-selling recording, 1981's Street Songs, sold over three million copies helping to renew sagging fortunes in Motown.\nAddictions to cocaine and crack however hampered his career by the late eighties and in the nineties, his legal troubles, which would include assaulting two women while under the influence of crack, led him to serve a three-year prison sentence at California's Folsom State Prison. James was released on parole in 1996 and resumed his musical career releasing the album, Urban Rapsody, in 1997. A mild stroke suffered during a concert in early 1998 interrupted his career for a brief time. James received new notoriety in 2004 when he appeared on an episode of Dave Chappelle's Chappelle Show in the Charlie Murphy \"True Hollywood Stories\" segment of the show, in which James' past wild lifestyle was satirized. James died later that year from heart failure at the age of 56.",
