      "biography": "Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American singer, songwriter, musician, and actress. Known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice, Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s with two mildly successful dance-pop albums. Afterward, as part of a recording deal, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. In 1995, she released Jagged Little Pill, a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million copies globally and is her most critically acclaimed work to date. This was made into a rock musical of the same name in 2017, which earned 15 Tony Award nominations including Best Musical. Her more experimental follow-up album, electronic-infused Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998.\n\nMorissette assumed creative control and producing duties for her subsequent studio albums, including Under Rug Swept (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavors of Entanglement (2008), and Havoc and Bright Lights (2012). Her ninth album, Such Pretty Forks in the Road, was released in 2020. Morissette has sold more than 75 million records worldwide and has been dubbed the \"Queen of Alt-Rock Angst\" by Rolling Stone.\n\nRead the full article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanis_Morissette\n\nStudio albums\nAlanis (1991)\nNow Is the Time (1992)\nJagged Little Pill (1995)\nSupposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998)\nUnder Rug Swept (2002)\nSo-Called Chaos (2004)\nFlavors of Entanglement (2008)\nHavoc and Bright Lights (2012)\nSuch Pretty Forks in the Road (2020) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alanis+Morissette\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Alanis Morissette’s era-defining album is full of these moments—snarling, eye-rolling, ugly truths that feel so good to say out loud. Like Morissette, whose arrival bridged the gap between grunge, alternative and mainstream pop, much of the album’s enduring magnetism is in its embrace of chaos and contradiction. Her blockbuster third LP (following two teen-pop records that went Top 40 in her native Canada) was poetic and straightforward, cynical and idealistic, sarcastic and wide-eyed, lost but hopeful (baby!). It is also fearlessly confrontational, with sharp-edged criticisms of Catholicism, technology and boyish men that few artists since have had the guts to echo. So when the 21-year-old former Nickelodeon star released it in 1995 after being dropped by her label, MCA Canada, its fresh and unapologetic worldview just hit different.<br />\nBeneath the record's radio-friendly hooks and shiny harmonies were startling observations on the messiness and banality of life. Human weakness is a theme—she’s hyperactive and distracted on “All I Really Want”, disoriented by happiness on “Head Over Feet”—but then, so is strength. On “Not the Doctor”, she refuses to play mother or babysitter for someone else’s problems. For women, many of Morissette's lyrics felt like a reckoning: “Right Through You” skewers a man for not taking her seriously (“You took a long hard look at my ass/And then played golf for a while”), and on “You Oughta Know”, the cheating-ex send-up lit with rage, she captures the fury felt from such blatant disrespect: “And every time I scratch my nails down someone else’s back I hope you feel it/Well, can you feel it?”<br />\nYet even if the album’s core spirit is disillusionment—a refusal to smile, play along or indulge—listeners seem to cling to its hopefulness, the idea that bleeding, screaming and learning is also, ultimately, living. Perhaps that’s why, for all her angst and anger, Morissette is relatively kind to herself. In the easygoing “Hand in My Pocket”, now a time capsule of cigarettes and taxi cabs, she forgives herself for not having it all figured out. Everything’s going to be fine, fine, fine.",

Human weakness is a theme—she’s hyperactive and distracted on “All I Really Want”, disoriented by happiness on “Head Over Feet”—but then, so is strength. On “Not the Doctor”, she refuses to play mother or babysitter for someone else’s problems. For women, many of Morissette's lyrics felt like a reckoning: “Right Through You” skewers a man for not taking her seriously (“You took a long hard look at my ass/And then played golf for a while”), and on “You Oughta Know”, the cheating-ex send-up lit with rage, she captures the fury felt from such blatant disrespect: “And every time I scratch my nails down someone else’s back I hope you feel it/Well, can you feel it?”<br />\nYet even if the album’s core spirit is disillusionment—a refusal to smile, play along or indulge—listeners seem to cling to its hopefulness, the idea that bleeding, screaming and learning is also, ultimately, living. Perhaps that’s why, for all her angst and anger, Morissette is relatively kind to herself. In the easygoing “Hand in My Pocket”, now a time capsule of cigarettes and taxi cabs, she forgives herself for not having it all figured out. Everything’s going to be fine, fine, fine.",

On July 29th 1998, the RIAA certified it 16.00× Multi-Platinum.\n\nIt was the second-best-selling album of the 1990s, behind Shania Twain's Come on Over, with twenty-eight million copies sold by 2000. By January 2005, the album had sold 30 million units worldwide.\n\nIn October 2002, Rolling Stone ranked it number 31 on its Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alanis+Morissette/Jagged+Little+Pill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
