  "biography": "Arctic Monkeys are an alternative rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar, piano), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.\n\nThey are one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet via MySpace, despite none of them having an account. Their rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs that had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.\n\nThe band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.. It also won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.\n\nOn 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member and bassist Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so they told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. \n\nThe band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, a week after the release of accompanying single \"Brianstorm\"\". Like the first album, this one quickly reached No. 1 in the album charts. Alex Turner described the songs as \"very different from last time\", adding that the sound of some tracks are \"a bit full-on\". A secret gig played at Sheffield's Leadmill on 10 February 2007, debuted seven new songs (six from Favourite Worst Nightmare and one other). Early reviews of the release were positive and described it as \"very, very fast and very, very loud\".\n\nThe band recorded half of the third album, Humbug at Rancho De La Luna recording sessions with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age in early autumn, 2008, and half in the New York sessions with James Ellis Ford, their producer, in spring, 2009, following their January tour of New Zealand and Australia. During this tour, lead single \"Crying Lightning\", along with Humbug songs \"Pretty Visitors\", \"Dangerous Animals\" and \"Potion Approaching\" (then known as \"Go-Kart\"), was debuted live. It was later revealed by Matt Helders in a video diary that the album would consist of 14 tracks and that Turner would stay in New York to oversee the mixing of the material. However, the final track listing, revealed on 1 June 2009, listed only 10.\n\nNME reported in May 2011 that the band were teaming up with producer James Ellis Ford once again and would be releasing their fourth studio album, Suck It And See, in late spring at the earliest. Q magazine reported that the fourth Arctic Monkeys album would be of a \"more accessible vintage\" than Humbug. Q printed edition 299 states \"It's the sound of a band drawing back the curtains and letting the sunshine in\". The album was recorded in Sound City Studios in Los Angeles in 2010 and 2011. On 4 March 2011, the band premiered on its website a new track called \"Brick By Brick\" with lead vocals by Matt Helders. Helders explained that this is not a single, just a tease of what is coming and that is it is going to be on the fourth album. On 10 March 2011 the band revealed the album name and was released on 6 June 2011. The album's first single, titled \"Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair\" was released as a digital download on 12 April and on vinyl with \"\"Brick By Brick\" on 16 April for Record Store Day.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, the band released a new song titled \"R U Mine\" on their YouTube channel, serving as the bands lead single for their fifth studio album AM, despite it was originally going to be a stand alone single. AM has received critical acclaim from music critics, upon the release of AM on 9 September 2013, the album debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts, selling over 157,000 copies in its first week. The album received widespread critical acclaim and brought Arctic Monkeys their third nomination for the Mercury Prize. The album also won the Brit award for Best British Album. In the United States, the album sold 42,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band's highest-charting album in the United States.\n\nIn December 2016, Turner confirmed to BBC Radio Sheffield that the band's hiatus had ended and work had begun on their sixth studio album. The album had begun recording in September 2017.The album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino was released on 11 May 2018. It's their first concept album, about being a hotel on the moon. Following its release, the album was promoted by the singles \"Four Out Of Five\" and \"Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\". This album had a massive change in sound compared to their first five albums, being slower and more piano based.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, the band was announced as the Saturday co-headliner of the 2022 Reading and Leeds Festival. On 23 August 2022 at the Zurich Openair festival, they debuted new song \"I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am\" The following day they announced their seventh studio album,  The Car, which was released on 21 October 2022. On 30 August 2022, they released the first single from the album, \"There'd Better Be A Mirrorball\", accompanied by a video directed by Turner. The Car peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, behind Midnights by Taylor Swift, being their first ever album to not debut at No.1 in the UK. In the US, the album landed at No. 6 on the Billboard 200.\n\nLead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the former singer/guitarist from the Rascals and guitarist of The Little Flames, Miles Kane. The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'.\n\nStudio albums\nWhatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006)\nFavourite Worst Nightmare (2007)\nHumbug (2009)\nSuck It And See (2011)\nAM (2013)\nTranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018)\nThe Car (2022)\n\nhttp://www.arcticmonkeys.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "bio_content": "Arctic Monkeys are an alternative rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar, piano), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.\n\nThey are one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet via MySpace, despite none of them having an account. Their rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs that had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.\n\nThe band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.. It also won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.\n\nOn 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member and bassist Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so they told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. \n\nThe band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, a week after the release of accompanying single \"Brianstorm\"\". Like the first album, this one quickly reached No. 1 in the album charts. Alex Turner described the songs as \"very different from last time\", adding that the sound of some tracks are \"a bit full-on\". A secret gig played at Sheffield's Leadmill on 10 February 2007, debuted seven new songs (six from Favourite Worst Nightmare and one other). Early reviews of the release were positive and described it as \"very, very fast and very, very loud\".\n\nThe band recorded half of the third album, Humbug at Rancho De La Luna recording sessions with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age in early autumn, 2008, and half in the New York sessions with James Ellis Ford, their producer, in spring, 2009, following their January tour of New Zealand and Australia. During this tour, lead single \"Crying Lightning\", along with Humbug songs \"Pretty Visitors\", \"Dangerous Animals\" and \"Potion Approaching\" (then known as \"Go-Kart\"), was debuted live. It was later revealed by Matt Helders in a video diary that the album would consist of 14 tracks and that Turner would stay in New York to oversee the mixing of the material. However, the final track listing, revealed on 1 June 2009, listed only 10.\n\nNME reported in May 2011 that the band were teaming up with producer James Ellis Ford once again and would be releasing their fourth studio album, Suck It And See, in late spring at the earliest. Q magazine reported that the fourth Arctic Monkeys album would be of a \"more accessible vintage\" than Humbug. Q printed edition 299 states \"It's the sound of a band drawing back the curtains and letting the sunshine in\". The album was recorded in Sound City Studios in Los Angeles in 2010 and 2011. On 4 March 2011, the band premiered on its website a new track called \"Brick By Brick\" with lead vocals by Matt Helders. Helders explained that this is not a single, just a tease of what is coming and that is it is going to be on the fourth album. On 10 March 2011 the band revealed the album name and was released on 6 June 2011. The album's first single, titled \"Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair\" was released as a digital download on 12 April and on vinyl with \"\"Brick By Brick\" on 16 April for Record Store Day.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, the band released a new song titled \"R U Mine\" on their YouTube channel, serving as the bands lead single for their fifth studio album AM, despite it was originally going to be a stand alone single. AM has received critical acclaim from music critics, upon the release of AM on 9 September 2013, the album debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts, selling over 157,000 copies in its first week. The album received widespread critical acclaim and brought Arctic Monkeys their third nomination for the Mercury Prize. The album also won the Brit award for Best British Album. In the United States, the album sold 42,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band's highest-charting album in the United States.\n\nIn December 2016, Turner confirmed to BBC Radio Sheffield that the band's hiatus had ended and work had begun on their sixth studio album. The album had begun recording in September 2017.The album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino was released on 11 May 2018. It's their first concept album, about being a hotel on the moon. Following its release, the album was promoted by the singles \"Four Out Of Five\" and \"Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\". This album had a massive change in sound compared to their first five albums, being slower and more piano based.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, the band was announced as the Saturday co-headliner of the 2022 Reading and Leeds Festival. On 23 August 2022 at the Zurich Openair festival, they debuted new song \"I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am\" The following day they announced their seventh studio album,  The Car, which was released on 21 October 2022. On 30 August 2022, they released the first single from the album, \"There'd Better Be A Mirrorball\", accompanied by a video directed by Turner. The Car peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, behind Midnights by Taylor Swift, being their first ever album to not debut at No.1 in the UK. In the US, the album landed at No. 6 on the Billboard 200.\n\nLead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the former singer/guitarist from the Rascals and guitarist of The Little Flames, Miles Kane. The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'.\n\nStudio albums\nWhatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006)\nFavourite Worst Nightmare (2007)\nHumbug (2009)\nSuck It And See (2011)\nAM (2013)\nTranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018)\nThe Car (2022)\n\nhttp://www.arcticmonkeys.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
