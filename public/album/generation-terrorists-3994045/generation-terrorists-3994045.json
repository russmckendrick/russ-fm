      "biography": "Manic Street Preachers are a Welsh alternative rock band that was formed in 1986 in Blackwood, South Wales and consists of James Dean Bradfield (lead vocals and lead guitar), Nicky Wire (bass guitar and lyrics) and Sean Moore (drums and percussion). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene, and were at their most prominent during the 1990s. They are colloquially known as \"The Manics\", or simply, \"Manics\". Originally a quartet, the band became a trio when primary lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995.\nIn 1992, the Manics released their debut studio album, Generation Terrorists. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery and critical social lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound.\nFollowing Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore and Wire persisted with Manic Street Preachers, and went on to gain critical and commercial success, becoming one of Britain's premier rock bands. Altogether, they have garnered eight Top 10 albums, fifteen Top 10 singles and have reached Number One three times—with their 1998 This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours album, the 1998 \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" single and the 2000 \"The Masses Against the Classes\" single.",

            "content": "Generation Terrorists is the debut album by Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 10 February 1992.\n\nIt was recorded by tracking (the band recorded each instrument separately rather than playing it as a live band and then adding the overdubs later) over a period of 23 weeks at Blackbarn Studios, near Guildford, England. Despite the whole band being credited in the album notes, vocalist James Dean Bradfield played all guitars and bass on the album. Per the producer Steve Brown's decision, most of the drum tracks on the album were recorded on a drum machine, which was programmed by Brown and the band's drummer Sean Moore.\n\nAll lyrics were written by Nicky Wire (real name Nicholas Jones) and Richey James Edwards. All music was written by James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore (except \"Damn Dog\", which is a cover version of a song by the Sleez Sisters from the 1980 movie Times Square).\n\nDescribing the album's musical style, The Quietus opined \"It had to sound passé, it had to be overdone; if you're trying to bulldoze the shiny edifice of western pop culture, you can't do it tastefully or with subtlety, can you?  Generation Terrorists intentionally overplays its hand, overeggs its pudding and spunks its load at every turn\". Pitchfork writer Joe Tangari wrote that Generation Terrorists \"walked a weird line between agit-punk, cock rock, romantic melodicism and glam, and was so obviously patterned after The Clash's London Calling that it was actually kind of cute.\" Rolling Stone, AllMusic, PopMatters and Vanyaland labeled the album as \"glam rock, hard rock, punk rock, glam punk and glam metal\" respectively. Other influences on the album's sound include Guns N' Roses and New York Dolls.\n\nThe album's lyrics are politicised like that of The Clash and Public Enemy. Wire and Edwards' love of poetry is also evident in their lyrics. The album's songs regularly switch from a critical focus on global capitalism to more personal tales of despair and the struggles of youth. Examples of the more politically inspired side of Generation Terrorists include the opening track \"Slash 'n' Burn\", which concerns \"third world exploitation\", the track \"Repeat (Stars and Stripes)\", a remix of the band's own anti-monarchy tirade by Public Enemy production team The Bomb Squad and \"Another Invented Disease\", a song whose title was deliberate word play on AIDS and referred to a conspiracy theory insinuating that the virus was manufactured by American biological warfare scientists.\n\nOther tracks combine personal and political themes, implicating a connection between global capitalism and personal struggle; \"Nat West-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds\" was written as a critique of overseas banking credit policies, but also concerned Richey Edwards' issues involving overdrafts and refused loans. Marc Burrows of Drowned in Sound considered the song to be an accurate prediction of \"global financial meltdown\" and its effects on everyday life. The single \"Motorcycle Emptiness\", meanwhile, criticises consumerism as a \"shallow dream\" that makes human life overtly commercialised. \"Little Baby Nothing\", a duet between Traci Lords and Bradfield, was described by Priya Elan of the NME as a \"perfect snapshot of  innocence bodysnatched and twisted\".\n\nIn the US, the track listing was changed, and some of the more political tracks were dropped. \"Democracy Coma\" was added to make up for this; it was later released as the B-side to \"Love's Sweet Exile\"/\"Repeat\", and also appeared on Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers). In addition, four tracks on the US release (\"Slash 'n' Burn\", \"Nat West–Barclays–Midlands–Lloyds\", \"Little Baby Nothing\" and \"You Love Us\") were remixed by Michael Brauer. These same four tracks also featured live drumming from American drummer Zachary Alford and were later included on the Stars and Stripes EP in Japan.\n\nThe cover was originally intended to be Andres Serrano's Pisschrist, a Jesus figure inside a tank of blood and urine, but Sony wanted to avoid any religious controversy; also, the royalty demanded for the piece was deemed excessive. Other ideas were the Bert Stern Marilyn Monroe photographs, a sandpaper sleeve that would scratch the album itself as well as anything else that it was shelved by (an old Situationist prank, this idea was used by Guy Debord for his first book Memoires and by The Durutti Column for their first album The Return of the Durutti Column), as well as several other famous religious paintings.\n\nThe final front cover of the album was a picture of Edwards' left arm and chest. The arm had a tattoo of a rose with the words \"USELESS GENERATION\" underneath, which was changed to \"GENERATION TERRORISTS\". This was not without problems, as the original pressing had made Edwards' flesh to be bright pink as opposed to the intended mustard. The back featured a design similar to their earlier New Art Riot EP cover, a European Commission flag, though this time it was crumpled and in flames. The working title of the album was Culture, Alienation, Boredom & Despair (a lyric from the song \"Little Baby Nothing\").\n\nOn 5 November 2012, Generation Terrorists was re-released for its 20th anniversary. There are five editions of the re-release: the original album; a two-disc Deluxe Edition with a bonus disc of demos and a DVD of the documentary film Culture, Alienation, Boredom, Despair, about the making of the album <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/Generation+Terrorists\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Other ideas were the Bert Stern Marilyn Monroe photographs, a sandpaper sleeve that would scratch the album itself as well as anything else that it was shelved by (an old Situationist prank, this idea was used by Guy Debord for his first book Memoires and by The Durutti Column for their first album The Return of the Durutti Column), as well as several other famous religious paintings.\n\nThe final front cover of the album was a picture of Edwards' left arm and chest. The arm had a tattoo of a rose with the words \"USELESS GENERATION\" underneath, which was changed to \"GENERATION TERRORISTS\". This was not without problems, as the original pressing had made Edwards' flesh to be bright pink as opposed to the intended mustard. The back featured a design similar to their earlier New Art Riot EP cover, a European Commission flag, though this time it was crumpled and in flames. The working title of the album was Culture, Alienation, Boredom & Despair (a lyric from the song \"Little Baby Nothing\").\n\nOn 5 November 2012, Generation Terrorists was re-released for its 20th anniversary. There are five editions of the re-release: the original album; a two-disc Deluxe Edition with a bonus disc of demos and a DVD of the documentary film Culture, Alienation, Boredom, Despair, about the making of the album <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/Generation+Terrorists\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_summary": "Generation Terrorists is the debut album by Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 10 February 1992. It was recorded by tracking (the band recorded each instrument separately rather than playing it as a live band and then adding the overdubs later) over a period of 23 weeks at Blackbarn Studios, near Guildford, England. Despite the whole band being credited in the album notes, vocalist James Dean Bradfield played all guitars and bass on the album. Per the producer Steve Brown's decision, most of the drum tracks on the album were recorded on a drum machine, which was programmed <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/Generation+Terrorists\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
