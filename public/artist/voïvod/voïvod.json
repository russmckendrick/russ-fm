Their musical style has changed several times since the band's origin in the early 1980s. Starting out as a speed metal band, Voivod have added a mix of progressive metal and thrash metal to try to create their own unique metal style.\n\nSince its debut record in 1984, Voivod have released eleven studio albums as well as one EP, one live album, two compilations, seven demos and one DVD featuring a live concert. The band found mainstream success in the late 1980s with its most successful album Nothingface (1989), which was the first Voivod album to enter the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 114. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Vo%C3%AFvod\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
