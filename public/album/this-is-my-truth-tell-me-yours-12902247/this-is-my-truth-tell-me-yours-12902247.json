      "biography": "Manic Street Preachers are a Welsh alternative rock band that was formed in 1986 in Blackwood, South Wales and consists of James Dean Bradfield (lead vocals and lead guitar), Nicky Wire (bass guitar and lyrics) and Sean Moore (drums and percussion). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene, and were at their most prominent during the 1990s. They are colloquially known as \"The Manics\", or simply, \"Manics\". Originally a quartet, the band became a trio when primary lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995.\nIn 1992, the Manics released their debut studio album, Generation Terrorists. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery and critical social lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound.\nFollowing Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore and Wire persisted with Manic Street Preachers, and went on to gain critical and commercial success, becoming one of Britain's premier rock bands. Altogether, they have garnered eight Top 10 albums, fifteen Top 10 singles and have reached Number One three times—with their 1998 This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours album, the 1998 \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" single and the 2000 \"The Masses Against the Classes\" single.",

It was released in September 1998 on Epic Records, and in the United States the following year, on Virgin Records.\n\nThe title is a quotation taken from a speech given by Welsh British Labour Party politician Aneurin Bevan. Its working title was simply 'Manic Street Preachers'.\n\nThis Is My Truth Tell Me Yours was the first Manics album to feature lyrics solely by Nicky Wire, while all the music was written by the habitual duo of James Dean Bradfield and cousin Sean Moore. The album is a much more subdued affair compared to previous albums with many songs having a more acoustic feel.\n\nAt the same time it shows the band experimenting with studio and production possibilities, as shown in several tracks — \"S.Y.M.M.\", \"I'm Not Working\" and \"Born a Girl\". In the bridge of the track \"Ready for Drowning\" there is a sample of Richard Burton (as John Morlar from the 1978 film The Medusa Touch): \"I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads\".\n\nThe cover photograph was taken on Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog. Hidden behind the disc's tray is a quotation from the 1995 book, No Truce With The Furies by R. S. Thomas.\n\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1999 Brit Awards.\n\nThe album debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart and spent three weeks at the top of the charts.\n\nThe album was preceded by the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\", which debuted at #1 on the UK Singles Chart, their first single to do so. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/This+Is+My+Truth+Tell+Me+Yours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the bridge of the track \"Ready for Drowning\" there is a sample of Richard Burton (as John Morlar from the 1978 film The Medusa Touch): \"I will bring the whole edifice down on their unworthy heads\".\n\nThe cover photograph was taken on Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog. Hidden behind the disc's tray is a quotation from the 1995 book, No Truce With The Furies by R. S. Thomas.\n\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1999 Brit Awards.\n\nThe album debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart and spent three weeks at the top of the charts.\n\nThe album was preceded by the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\", which debuted at #1 on the UK Singles Chart, their first single to do so. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/This+Is+My+Truth+Tell+Me+Yours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_summary": "This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours is the fifth album by Welsh band Manic Street Preachers. It was released in September 1998 on Epic Records, and in the United States the following year, on Virgin Records. The title is a quotation taken from a speech given by Welsh British Labour Party politician Aneurin Bevan. Its working title was simply 'Manic Street Preachers'. This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours was the first Manics album to feature lyrics solely by Nicky Wire, while all the music was written by the habitual duo of James Dean Bradfield and cousin Sean Moore. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/This+Is+My+Truth+Tell+Me+Yours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
