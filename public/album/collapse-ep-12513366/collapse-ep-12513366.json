      "biography": "Richard David James (born 18 August 1971), best known under the pseudonym Aphex Twin, is a British electronic musician and composer. He founded the record label Rephlex Records in 1991 with Grant Wilson-Claridge. He has been described by The Guardian as \"the most inventive and influential figure in contemporary electronic music.\"\n\nAphex Twin has also recorded music under the aliases AFX, Blue Calx, Bradley Strider, Caustic Window, DJ Smojphace, GAK, Martin Tressider, Polygon Window, Power-Pill, Prichard D. Jams, Q-Chastic, Tahnaiya Russell, The Dice Man, Soit-P.P., and speculatively The Tuss.\n\nAphex Twin has released recordings on Rephlex, Warp, R&S, Sire, Mighty Force, Rabbit City, and Men Records.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\n\nJames was born on 18 August 1971 in Limerick, the son of Welsh parents. He grew up in Lanner, Cornwall, with two older sisters, in a \"very happy\" childhood during which they \"were pretty much left to do what  wanted\". He enjoyed living there, feeling apart from nearby cities and the rest of the world. Some of his earliest musical experiments as a child involved James playing with the strings inside his family's piano, similar to composer John Cage's prepared piano experiments, and at age nine he began purchasing tapes and tape recorders. James attended Redruth School in Redruth, Cornwall, and claimed to have produced sound on a Sinclair ZX81 (a machine with no sound hardware) at age 11:\n\n“\tWhen I was 11, I won 50 pounds in a competition for writing this program that made sound on a ZX81. You couldn't make sound on a ZX81, but I played around with machine code and found some codes that retuned the TV signal so that it made this really weird noise when you turned the volume up.\t”\nAccording to musician Benjamin Middleton, James began producing music the following year. At age twelve, he bought his first synthesiser, which he reassembled himself: \"I started off modifying analogue synths and junk that I bought, and got addicted to making noises. That was the buzz for me. At that point, I'd never really listened to music.\" As a teenager he was a disc jockey at the Shire Horse Inn in St Ives, with Tom Middleton at the Bowgie Inn in Crantock and along the beaches around Cornwall. James studied at Cornwall College from 1988 to 1990 for a National Diploma in engineering. About his studies, he said \"music and electronics went hand in hand\". James graduated from college; according to an engineering lecturer he often wore headphones during practical lessons, \"no doubt thinking through the mixes he'd be working on later\".",

The multi-part epic “T69 collapse” begins simply, with rubbery electro rhythms and wistful synths, but halfway through, the drums go haywire and threaten to pull the track apart at any moment. “Pthex” follows a similarly fraught path, starting with gentle echoes of James’ early-’90s ambient works before tangling up in knots. And the streamlined “1st 44” strips back to virtually nothing but shuddering kicks and claps; it’s one of his heaviest drum tracks ever.",

While the recent years run of live shows have seen him slicing and dicing the freshest lazer-guided melodies from artists including Mark Fell & Gabor Lazar, Jlin, Kamixlo and Lanark Artefax, it would appear that the Collapse EP is the Aphex Twin spin on the post-genre, everything goes, electronic inter(net)underground... Basically this is an amazing and properly fresh record from one of the true pioneers of the hypnotic groove.\n\nMake no mistake, Collapse EP hits on every single level imaginable, marking both new ways forward for every future style going, from footwork to electro-dub it even finds time to throw in some of the most stomach-churning darkside pads imaginable. Trust us, when they hit it's like a time travelling Basil Kirchin or early 80's NWW have gate crashed/crashed landed in 2018 only to discover the joys of electronic sequencing and bought themselves matching tanks as some sort of mad keyboard that they are using to fire beats into the truly never-ending possibilities of the studio within the digital age.\n\nWhere previous Aphex records have been like standing in a power station on acid, Collapse EP is what happens when you fall through the floor and land in the basement club, soundsystem going off and one of the very best there ever was/is/will be behind the decks.\n\nJoy and happiness lies ahead, Collapse EP is here... fall into its wonderment! <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aphex+Twin/Collapse+EP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
