  "biography": "Elbow are a British alternative rock band, comprising Guy Garvey (vocals, guitar), Richard Jupp (drums, percussion), Craig Potter (keyboards, piano), Mark Potter (guitar, backing vocals), and Pete Turner (bass guitar, backing vocals). They have played together since 1990 and released five studio albums: Asleep in the Back (2001), Cast of Thousands (2003), Leaders of the Free World (2005), The Seldom Seen Kid (2008) and Build a Rocket Boys! (2011). In the UK all of their albums have made the top twenty and seven of their singles have been in the top forty.\nIn 2008 they won the Mercury Music Prize for their album The Seldom Seen Kid and in November 2011 it was announced that they will be composing the BBC's 2012 Olympic coverage theme tune.\nLead singer Guy Garvey met guitarist Mark Potter at Stand College in 1990 at the age of 16. Potter asked Garvey to sing in a band he was in with drummer Richard Jupp and bassist Pete Turner. Together, the four men formed the band Mr Soft. (The name was later changed to Soft.) Mark Potter's brother Craig Potter joined the band soon after on keyboards. That year members of the band first played together at The Grants Arms pub in Ramsbottom, Bury, a borough of Greater Manchester).\nBy 1997, they had changed their name a third time to Elbow, after a line in the BBC TV drama The Singing Detective. A character (Philip Marlowe) says that the word \"elbow\" is the most sensuous word in the English language; not for its definition, but for how it feels to say it and how it looks on the page. The band signed a deal with Island Records, and recorded an album that was to be their debut, produced by Steve Osborne. However, when Island was bought out by major label Universal, the band was dropped in a mass cull and the album was never released.\nThey continued to record on the iconic independent label Ugly Man, and released The Noisebox EP, The Newborn EP, and The Any Day Now EP. This gained them extensive airplay by BBC Radio 1.",

Though the group came about in 1990, intially going by names such as \\'Soft\\' and \\'Mr. Soft\\', it wasn\\'t until \\'The Noisebox EP\\' came out on 1 January 1998 that they had a real release. Elbow started out specializing in \"chilled funk\", but the guys changed the direction of their music after unanimously deciding that they were \"shit.\"\\n\\nTheir new songs picked up notice from both Island Records, but the band got dropped due to business shenanigans before anything actually came out post-singing. Elbow then released two critically acclaimed EP\\'s on the independent Ugly Man Record label, starting with the aformentioned \\'Noisebox EP\\'. Luckily, their work caught the attention of V2 Records. \\n\\nV2 released Elbow\\'s debut album: \"Asleep In The Back.\" The album was a surprisingly moderate success, gaining substantial critical acclaim and, ultimately, a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize in 2001. The single \"Newborn\" received attention after being banned by Radio 1 for the lyric, \"I\\'ll be the corpse in your bathtub.\"\\n\\nIts 2003 album, \"Cast Of Thousands,\" entered the UK Charts at #7 to critical acclaim.  The lead single, \"Fallen Angel,\" charted at #19. \\n\\nElbow released its third album in 2005: \"Leaders Of The Free World.\" Despite a continued lack of commercial notice, \"Leaders Of The Free World\" charted at #12, with its lead single, \"Forget Myself\" achieving #22 in the charts.  That autumn, Elbow headlined the first of two sell-out tours.\\n\\nMarch 17, 2008, saw the release of Elbow\\'s fourth album, entitled \"The Seldom Seen Kid.\" Released through Fiction, it entered the UK album chart at #5, and went on to win the 2008 Mercury Music Award. \"The Fix,\" features guest vocals and lead guitar by Richard Hawley. April 2009 saw the release of The Seldom Seen Kid Live At Abbey Road, recorded with The BBC Concert Orchestra and Chantage. This album, recorded in Studio One of the world famous Abbey Road Studios on Saturday, January 17, 2008, is a complete run-through of the Mercury winning album. It features the band, a 52-piece orchestra, and a 20-member choir.\\n\\nThe band\\'s fifth album Build A Rocket Boys! was released in the UK on March 14, 2011.\\n\\nIn July 2015, Elbow released the Lost Worker Bee EP, which was soon followed by Guy Garvey\\'s first solo album \\'Courting the Squall\\' (Oct 2015).\\n\\nTheir seventh studio album, \\'Little Fictions\\' was released on 3 February 2017, with Elbow\\'s eighth studio album, \\'Giants of All Sizes\\', released 2 years later on 11 October 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elbow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "Elbow are a British alternative rock band, comprising Guy Garvey (vocals, guitar), Richard Jupp (drums, percussion), Craig Potter (keyboards, piano), Mark Potter (guitar, backing vocals), and Pete Turner (bass guitar, backing vocals). They have played together since 1990 and released five studio albums: Asleep in the Back (2001), Cast of Thousands (2003), Leaders of the Free World (2005), The Seldom Seen Kid (2008) and Build a Rocket Boys! (2011). In the UK all of their albums have made the top twenty and seven of their singles have been in the top forty.\nIn 2008 they won the Mercury Music Prize for their album The Seldom Seen Kid and in November 2011 it was announced that they will be composing the BBC's 2012 Olympic coverage theme tune.\nLead singer Guy Garvey met guitarist Mark Potter at Stand College in 1990 at the age of 16. Potter asked Garvey to sing in a band he was in with drummer Richard Jupp and bassist Pete Turner. Together, the four men formed the band Mr Soft. (The name was later changed to Soft.) Mark Potter's brother Craig Potter joined the band soon after on keyboards. That year members of the band first played together at The Grants Arms pub in Ramsbottom, Bury, a borough of Greater Manchester).\nBy 1997, they had changed their name a third time to Elbow, after a line in the BBC TV drama The Singing Detective. A character (Philip Marlowe) says that the word \"elbow\" is the most sensuous word in the English language; not for its definition, but for how it feels to say it and how it looks on the page. The band signed a deal with Island Records, and recorded an album that was to be their debut, produced by Steve Osborne. However, when Island was bought out by major label Universal, the band was dropped in a mass cull and the album was never released.\nThey continued to record on the iconic independent label Ugly Man, and released The Noisebox EP, The Newborn EP, and The Any Day Now EP. This gained them extensive airplay by BBC Radio 1.",

      "biography_en": "Elbow are a British alternative rock band, comprising Guy Garvey (vocals, guitar), Richard Jupp (drums, percussion), Craig Potter (keyboards, piano), Mark Potter (guitar, backing vocals), and Pete Turner (bass guitar, backing vocals). They have played together since 1990 and released five studio albums: Asleep in the Back (2001), Cast of Thousands (2003), Leaders of the Free World (2005), The Seldom Seen Kid (2008) and Build a Rocket Boys! (2011). In the UK all of their albums have made the top twenty and seven of their singles have been in the top forty.\nIn 2008 they won the Mercury Music Prize for their album The Seldom Seen Kid and in November 2011 it was announced that they will be composing the BBC's 2012 Olympic coverage theme tune.\nLead singer Guy Garvey met guitarist Mark Potter at Stand College in 1990 at the age of 16. Potter asked Garvey to sing in a band he was in with drummer Richard Jupp and bassist Pete Turner. Together, the four men formed the band Mr Soft. (The name was later changed to Soft.) Mark Potter's brother Craig Potter joined the band soon after on keyboards. That year members of the band first played together at The Grants Arms pub in Ramsbottom, Bury, a borough of Greater Manchester).\nBy 1997, they had changed their name a third time to Elbow, after a line in the BBC TV drama The Singing Detective. A character (Philip Marlowe) says that the word \"elbow\" is the most sensuous word in the English language; not for its definition, but for how it feels to say it and how it looks on the page. The band signed a deal with Island Records, and recorded an album that was to be their debut, produced by Steve Osborne. However, when Island was bought out by major label Universal, the band was dropped in a mass cull and the album was never released.\nThey continued to record on the iconic independent label Ugly Man, and released The Noisebox EP, The Newborn EP, and The Any Day Now EP. This gained them extensive airplay by BBC Radio 1.",
