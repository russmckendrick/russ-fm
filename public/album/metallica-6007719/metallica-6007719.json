      "biography": "Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California. Metallica was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. The band's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Lead guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of the band's albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.\nThe band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction, resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without consent from any band member. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the \"steel-sounding\" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nMetallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. As of 2016, the band is in production of its tenth studio album, which is expected to be released later in the year.",

And while The Black Album’s win didn’t constitute acceptance, per se, it acknowledged what fans of the band had understood for going on 10 years: Metal was the vanguard of hard rock, and Metallica was the vanguard of metal.<br />\nDrummer and co-writer Lars Ulrich says they used to labour for hours over the perfect take, Frankenstein-ing together fragments of drum parts, punching in riffs, blending and overdubbing until every wrinkle was ironed flat. They wanted precision, and by precision they meant technical mastery—a superlative in a world where the goal is to play as hard, fast and complicatedly as possible without slipping.<br />\nAnd it isn’t that The Black Album isn’t complex. But whereas tracks like “One”, “Master of Puppets” and “Seek & Destroy”—songs that not only defined Metallica’s sound, but the sound of ’80s metal in general—foregrounded complexity as proof of the band’s stamina and ambition, the music here is streamlined and the performances natural. Ulrich says producer Bob Rock helped them understand their recordings not just as seamless stacks of riffs, but as shapes with ebb and flow, rise and fall.<br />\nIn the songs’ simplicity is a clear confidence: “Enter Sandman” and “Sad but True” are two of the heaviest tracks the band recorded, but also two of the most straightforward. “The Unforgiven” evokes Celtic folk and the majestic spaghetti Western soundtracks of Ennio Morricone (whose “The Ecstasy of Gold” long served as their walk-on music), but it works just as well around the campfire. James Hetfield wasn’t sure whether “Nothing Else Matters” even belonged on a Metallica album—it was so personal, so disclosing. But they’d always trusted their gut, and in doing so helped revise Led Zeppelin ballads for the post-punk era: They thrash, but they do it with tenderness. ",

            "content": "Metallica (also known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released August 12, 1991 through Elektra Records. It features some of Metallica's most popular songs, \"Enter Sandman\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Nothing Else Matters\" , \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Sad but True\". It spent four consecutive weeks at number one on Billboard 200. Metallica is the band's best-selling album to date, with over 16 million physical copies sold in the United States and over 31 million copies worldwide. It is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.\n\nThe album cover features only the band's logo, angled against the upper left corner, and a coiled snake (derived from the Gadsden flag) on the bottom right corner, both in a dark shade of gray in order to be made out against the black background. The motto of the Gadsden flag, \"Don't Tread on Me\", is also the title of a song featured on the album.\n\nThe cover is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's Smell the Glove album, something the band jokingly acknowledged themselves in their A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary (where members of Spinal Tap appeared and asked them about it).\n\nMetallica DVD-Audio 5.1 mix was released in 2004 through Elektra Records.\n\nWhile the album and the band were critically praised and commercially successful, some fans expressed disappointment in the new direction taken by Metallica. Gone for the most part were faster staccato riffs during verses and throaty vocals found on the band's first four albums; the overall speed and complexity of the music was somewhat lessened. The Black Album presented a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible Metallica, especially evidenced by the ballad \"Nothing Else Matters\". Moreover, following the success of \"One,\" the breakaway single from their …And Justice for All album, five videos were released from The Black Album. (\"Enter Sandman\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"Sad but True\", \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"The Unforgiven\").\n\nThe lyrics of The Black Album, written by James Hetfield, were much more personal and introspective in nature than previous Metallica albums. For example, \"The God That Failed\" dealt with Hetfield's mother's death from cancer and her Christian Science beliefs which kept her from seeking medical treatment. \"Nothing Else Matters\" expresses the connection Hetfield felt with a girlfriend while out on the road.

Metallica is the band's best-selling album to date, with over 16 million physical copies sold in the United States and over 31 million copies worldwide. It is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.\n\nThe album cover features only the band's logo, angled against the upper left corner, and a coiled snake (derived from the Gadsden flag) on the bottom right corner, both in a dark shade of gray in order to be made out against the black background. The motto of the Gadsden flag, \"Don't Tread on Me\", is also the title of a song featured on the album.\n\nThe cover is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's Smell the Glove album, something the band jokingly acknowledged themselves in their A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary (where members of Spinal Tap appeared and asked them about it).\n\nMetallica DVD-Audio 5.1 mix was released in 2004 through Elektra Records.\n\nWhile the album and the band were critically praised and commercially successful, some fans expressed disappointment in the new direction taken by Metallica. Gone for the most part were faster staccato riffs during verses and throaty vocals found on the band's first four albums; the overall speed and complexity of the music was somewhat lessened. The Black Album presented a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible Metallica, especially evidenced by the ballad \"Nothing Else Matters\". Moreover, following the success of \"One,\" the breakaway single from their …And Justice for All album, five videos were released from The Black Album.
