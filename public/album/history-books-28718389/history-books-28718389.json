      "biography": "The Gaslight Anthem is an American rock band from New Brunswick, New Jersey. Since forming in 2006, they have released six full-length albums and an EP. They were described by Kerrang! magazine as “the best new band you’ll hear in 2008.” The lineup consists of Brian Fallon (vocals and guitar), Alex Levine (bass), Benny Horowitz (drums), and Alex Rosamilia (guitar). On July 29, 2015, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. \n\nThe Gaslight Anthem’s music embraces many elements of blues, classic rock, and punk rock. The band has described their sound as “Bruce Springsteen singing for a Cure cover band, with a tinge more aggression.” The group’s fondness for Springsteen, a significant influence on their music, is celebrated by fans and critics alike. Representative of such views, one critic wrote, “The Gaslight Anthem are like something out of speculative fiction: this is what pop music would be if Springsteen hadn’t listened to his producer, let the Ramones record ‘Hungry Heart,’ and launched the C.B.G.B.’ers into megastardom.”\n\nThe band released its first LP, Sink or Swim, in 2007 through XOXO Records, and toured with many reputable bands, including Against Me!, The Draft, Dead to Me, and Fake Problems.\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem’s second release, a 4-song EP entitled Señor and the Queen, was released on January 29th, 2008 by Sabot Productions.\n\nTheir second full-length, The ‘59 Sound, was released on August 19, 2008 on Side One Dummy Records. The album debuted at #70 on the Billboard top 200. It was produced by Ted Hutt, who has produced albums for The Bouncing Souls, Flogging Molly, and MxPx.\n\nOn August 6, 2008 they became the first band to ever appear on the cover of Kerrang! magazine without the publication having previously written a single word about them.\n\nIn Fall 2008, the band toured with Rise Against, Alkaline Trio, and Thrice.\n\nOn December 9, 2008, the Gaslight Anthem made their television debut on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, performing the song the “The ‘59 Sound.” On January 30, 2009, they appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman, again playing “The ‘59 Sound.”\n\nTheir third full-length, American Slang, was released on June 15, 2010, on Side One Dummy Records. The Bring It On Songfacts reports that it finds the band moving away from the fictional lyrics and '50s-inspired sound of their previous records. \n\nIn 2010 they appeared on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festivals in the UK along with Arcade Fire, The Libertines and Modest Mouse.\n\nTheir fourth full-length, Handwritten was released on July 23, 2012 in the UK, and on July 24 in the US. The lead single, \"45\", was aired for the first time worldwide as Zane Lowe's Hottest Record in the World on April 30, 2012 on BBC Radio 1 and was released on iTunes on May 8, 2012.

      "editorial_notes": "The Gaslight Anthem’s 2023 LP <i>History Books</i> serves as their first since 2014, and the band bring such ferocity to their return, it sounds as if they’re trying to wipe away a near-decade’s worth of cobwebs in a single riff, cymbal crash and lyric. Sombre but not sad, <i>History Books</i> recalls the urgency and triumph of the band’s sophomore effort and breakthrough, 2008’s <i>The '59 Sound</i>. Singer Brian Fallon sounds reinvigorated and as tenacious as ever, yet also a bit wiser since the last time he and his band checked in. Opener “Spider Bites” shines with soaring guitar solos and a galloping drum groove. Fallon’s voice is awash in distortion, less desperate but no less passionate than he sounded as a young man 15 years prior to <i>History Books</i>. \n\nThe Jersey-bred band still pays homage to their chief influence Bruce Springsteen on <i>History Books</i> (they even recorded a version of the title track with him), but the inspirations are more varied, less indebted to a particular time, place and Boss. “Autumn” is a blues rock bar sing-along, and “Michigan, 1975” shows a restraint and tension reminiscent of alt-rock anthems that populated radio playlists when The Gaslight Anthem’s band members were still boys. Sort of like Faulkner once said, the past is never dead. It ain’t even the past.\n",
