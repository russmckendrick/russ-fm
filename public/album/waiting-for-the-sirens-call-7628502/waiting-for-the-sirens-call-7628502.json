      "biography": "New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 by Bernard Sumner (vocals, guitars, synthesisers), Peter Hook (bass, synthesisers) and Stephen Morris (drums, electronic drums, synthesisers) - the remaining members of Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis - with the addition of Gillian Gilbert (keyboards, guitars, synthesisers). In 1993 the band broke-up amidst tension between bandmembers, but reformed in 1998. In 2001, Phil Cunningham (guitars, synthesisers) replaced Gilbert, who left the group due to family commitments. In 2007, Peter Hook left the band and the band broke-up again, with Sumner saying in 2009 that he no longer wishes to make music as New Order. The band reunited in 2011 without Hook, with Gilbert returning to the fold and Tom Chapman replacing Hook on bass. During the band's career and inbetween lengthy breaks, bandmembers have immersed themselves on number of solo projects, such as Sumner's Electronic and Bad Lieutenant; Hook's Monaco and Revenge and Gilbert's and Morris' The Other Two.\nBy combining New Wave and electronic music, New Order became one of the most critically acclaimed and highly influential bands of the 1980s. Though the band's early years were shadowed by the legacy and basic sound of Joy Division, their immersion in the early 1980s New York City club scene increased their knowledge of dance music and enabled them to incorporate elements of that style into their work. The band's 1983 hit \"Blue Monday\", the best-selling 12-inch single of all time, is one example of how the band transformed their sound.\nNew Order were the flagship band for Factory Records. Their minimalist album sleeves and \"non-image\" (the band rarely gave interviews and were known for performing short concert sets with no encores) reflected the label's aesthetic of doing whatever the relevant parties wanted to do, including an aversion to including singles as album tracks. The band has often been acclaimed by fans, critics and other musicians as a highly influential force in the alternative rock, dance and rave music scenes.",

The band’s circa-1980s tunes had been rediscovered and revived by a new generation of listeners, many of whom were entranced by <i>Waiting for the Sirens’ Call</i>, which was as effortlessly cool as anything Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris had ever created as a band.\n\nThe band members were aided in their efforts by an array of new producers, including indie legends Stephen Street (The Smiths, The Cranberries, Blur) and John Leckie (Muse, Radiohead, The Stone Roses), as well as electronic fave Stuart Price, who was also busy making Madonna relevant for the umpteenth time via <i>Confessions on a Dancefloor</i>. It was Price who introduced New Order to Scissor Sisters singer Ana Matronic, resulting in the standout <i>Sirens’ Call</i> single “Jetstream”. That injection of new blood also extended to the songwriting: The band brought <i>Get Ready</i> touring guitarist Phil Cunningham into the writing room, increasing the group’s output, resulting in so many ideas that Sumner—now New Order’s principle lyricist—fretted he wouldn’t be able to complete all of the compositions.\n\nAll that newfound effort paid off: Singles “Krafty” and “Jetstream” both received ample club play, partly because they were each packaged with a plethora of remixes (a first for the group). And because <i>Waiting for the Sirens’ Call</i> showed up just as both New Order <i>and</i> Joy Division were experiencing massive revivals, the members of New Order were able to land a primo spot at 2005’s Coachella festival, and then hit the road for a series of high-profile gigs—before once again breaking up.",
