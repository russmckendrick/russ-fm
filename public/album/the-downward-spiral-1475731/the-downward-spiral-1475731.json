      "biography": "Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated as NIN, sometimes stylized as NIИ) is an American industrial rock project, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor (until the 2009 Wave Goodbye Tour) usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows.\n\nUnderground music audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits; two Nine Inch Nails recordings have won Grammy Awards; and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 30 million albums worldwide, with 11 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\" In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently.\n\nSince 1989, Nine Inch Nails has made eight major studio releases. The most recent releases, Ghosts I-IV and The Slip, both released in 2008, were released under Creative Commons licenses (BY-NC-SA). Both were initially released digitally, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of The Slip was made available completely free of charge. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards and won twice for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\", in 1992 and 1995 respectively.",

(Reznor himself remains somewhat incredulous—a note on the band’s own website describes the album as a “celebration of self-destruction in the form of a concept record that somehow managed to become a multi-platinum worldwide hit.”)\n\nInspired by Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, and David Bowie’s Berlin trilogy (<i>Low</i> in particular), <i>Spiral</i> pushed the industrial pop of <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> and the <i>Broken</i> EP in unexpected directions, experimenting with torch songs (“Piggy”), disco and soul (“Closer”) and ballads of such unnerving fragility that listening to them feels voyeuristic (“Hurt”). Even tracks that found continuity with the band’s earlier music—“Big Man with a Gun”, the stuttering hardcore of “March of the Pigs”—were drastically more aggressive than anything they’d done before, flashes of mania that made the album’s quieter moments feel all the more exhausted.\n\nWhat emerged was a pattern of emotional whiplash: You feel like you can topple the world, shred your tormentors, vent your toxic depths. Then, suddenly, you feel nothing. That you could whistle along with half of it was perverse but strangely fitting, especially given Reznor’s S&M affectations: Here was pain that felt pretty good. The album’s sound was just as polarised. Mixing digital and analogue, sample collages with live performances, densely processed signals with naturalistic ones, <i>Spiral</i> was a drastic renovation to the texture and feel of conventional rock. Even now, it feels damaged, noisy, wrong—the product of both a gleaming future and an already ruined past. If the album has an essentialising moment, it’s the climax of “Closer”: mechanistic synth-funk that gives way to a warped, solitary piano, part music box, part trash. After <i>Spiral</i>, artists didn’t have to decide whether to be a rock band or an electronic producer—Reznor had bridged the two.\n\n“I was feeling my way around,” Reznor told Zane Lowe of the period leading up to <i>Spiral</i>. “What do I have to say? I didn’t live this exotic life. I grew up in a town in Pennsylvania. Kind of boring. What I did know is how I felt about myself, and my struggles to figure out who and what and why from my own perspective.” And therein lies the album’s healing irony: In facing the abyss, Reznor found his congregation.",

What I did know is how I felt about myself, and my struggles to figure out who and what and why from my own perspective.” And therein lies the album’s healing irony: In facing the abyss, Reznor found his congregation.",

            "content": "The Downward Spiral (also known as Halo 8) is Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, though it is largely considered the third major release after the Broken EP, which consisted of entirely new material. It was released on March 8, 1994. It is likely the most acclaimed and well-known of the band's discography, and is said to have brought \"industrial\" music to the mainstream. A collection featuring remixes from The Downward Spiral was released as Further Down The Spiral on June 1, 1995.\n\nInspiration\nTrent Reznor has stated in various interviews some of the ideas and inspiration behind the album:\n\"The idea behind the album is of someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on. It's less muscle-flexing, though when I started it I didn't know what I wanted it to sound like. I knew I didn't want to be a full metal album, so I tried to address the issue of restraint. It was a long process.\nThematically I wanted to explore the idea of somebody who systematically throws or uncovers every layer of what he's surrounded with, comfort-wise, from personal relationships to religion to questioning the whole situation. Someone dissecting his own ability to relate to other people or to have anything to believe in...With 'The Downward Spiral' I tried to make a record that had full range, rather than a real guitar-based record or a real synth-based record. I tried to make it something that opened the palate for NIN, so we don't get pigeon-holed. It was a conscious effort to focus more on texture and space, rather than bludgeoning you over the head for an hour with a guitar.\nI was really into electronic music at the time. David Bowie's 'Low' was probably the single greatest influence on 'The Downward Spiral' for me. I got into Bowie in the 'Scary Monsters' era, then I picked up 'Low' and instantly fell for it. I related to it on a song-writing level, a mood level, and on a song-structure level...I like working within the framework of accessibility, and songs of course, but I also like things that are more experimental and instrumental, maybe.\"\nPink Floyd's The Wall was also heavy in Reznor's rotation during the making of the album. In a Q+A session before the 2017 Riot Fest show, it was revealed that David Lynch's use of sound in his films was an inspiration for the sound design of The Downward Spiral.\n\nRecording\nReznor set out to make an album that was a departure from the Broken EP (\"when I went into the studio, I knew that I didn't want to make Broken again\"), which he described as \"a real hard-sounding record that was just one big blast of anger.\" Instead, Reznor wanted to create an album \"that went in 10 different directions, but that was all united somehow.\" Reznor brought in a number of guest performers to record, including Stephen Perkins and Adrian Belew. Perkins played a number of drum parts that were recorded live in the studio; these tracks were then turned into sample loops. Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts. Reznor would record 20 to 25-minute long sessions of himself playing guitar on a hard disc recorder with a Studio Vision sequencer, then would cut out parts of the recording he found interesting for later use. Reznor said, \"99 percent of the stuff we do–even vocals–is recorded into the computer  first. We get an arrangement together and then dump it to tape.\" For \"Mr. Self Destruct\", Reznor ran the entire mix through the mic pre-amps of several modules plundered from an old Neve board.\nLike other NIN releases, some songs never made it to the final album. In this case, some songs were \"The Beauty Of The Drug\", which was a general out take, and \"Just Do It\", which was a track prompting the album's protagonist to kill himself. The latter was axed at the request of Flood, who refused to have anything to do with it.\n\nConcept and interpretations\nThere are numerous layers of metaphors that are present throughout the album, which leaves it open to wide interpretation. As a whole, The Downward Spiral is defined by Nietzschean concepts and a prominent theme of existentialism. It is a concept album in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist moving through his own \"downward spiral\", dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally suicide. Reznor has stated that the character is a representation of himself:\n\"...it was during that tour (Self Destruct) that problems started to arise. Prior to that I would have considered myself pretty normal. With the Downward Spiral, I can remember where I was in my head, what I was thinking, and I can remember writing that record, and the mindset. This record that was about an extension of me, became the truth fulfilling itself.\"\nMost fans seem to agree that \"Closer\" (noted for its \"I want to fuck you like an animal\" lyric) has meaning deeper than its surface lyrics (note the desperate dependency expressed by the final line, \"you are the reason I stay alive.\") The narrator was not exactly modeled after Reznor's previous life, though he would later go through his own sort of \"downward spiral\" during the Fragility tour, battling issues such as drug abuse.\n\nTouring\nThe album was supported by a major tour that lasted nearly two years. It circled North America a few times and also visited Europe and Australia. The shows were very intense and included well-programmed lighting and very aggressive performances, with a few injuries and many instruments being mangled in the process. Techs for the tour were tasked with going to pawn shops to buy surplus instruments to be destroyed onstage. Valuable keyboards were offstage and Yamaha DX7 keyboards were used as MIDI controllers to trigger them. A co-headlining leg with David Bowie, referred to as the Dissonance tour, took place in 1995. The tour culminated with a few club dates showcasing artists that were on Nothing Records. Portions of the tour were documented and released as part one of the Closure double VHS in 1997. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails/The+Downward+Spiral\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
