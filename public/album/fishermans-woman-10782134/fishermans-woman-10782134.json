      "biography": "Emilíana Torrini Davíðsdóttir. Born 16 May 1977 in Kópavogur, Iceland. Singer-songwriter Emilíana, best known for her international debut album, Love In The Time Of Science - a glossy trip-hop affair in collaboration with Tears for Fears' Roland Orzabal.\n\nIn collaboration with Dan Carey, her second major album release, Fisherman's Woman, signified a major departure from her earlier electronic roots to an acoustic-folk sound; applying the ethereal beauty of her voice in a much more intimate setting akin to fellow countrymen múm's recent endeavours, and folk-royalty Nick Drake. She has a delicate, breathy and almost childlike quality that complements the quiet lullaby of her later work.\n\nA third album, Me and Armini was released on 8 September 2008, to generally good reviews \n\nPrior to her appearance on the worldwide stage, she released 3 albums in Iceland, and worked with trip-hop group Gus Gus on their debut Polydistortion. She continues to collaborate with other artists, notably penning Kylie Minogue's international #1 track Slow with Dan Carey in 2003, and providing the voice for Gollum's Song, the closing theme for the film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. She also features in a number of Thievery Corporation tracks, and on Slovo's debut album, Nommo.\n\nShe is of both Italian and Icelandic parentage; her father owns and operates a well-known Italian restaurant in Iceland, and many Icelanders first remember her as a young waitress. She currently resides in Brighton, England. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Emiliana+Torrini\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
