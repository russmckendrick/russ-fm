      "biography": "Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer-songwriter, musician and humanitarian activist who rose to fame as the original lead singer and flautist of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, Gabriel went on to a successful solo career, with \"Solsbury Hill\" his first single. His 1986 album, So, is his most commercially successful, and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the U.S. The album's biggest hit, \"Sledgehammer\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, and it remains the most played music video in the history of MTV.\nGabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has also pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \"Biko\". He has participated in several human rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the WITNESS human rights organisation in 1992. Gabriel developed The Elders with Richard Branson, which was launched by Nelson Mandela in 2007.\nGabriel has won three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male in 1987, six Grammy Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was made a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his \"influence on generations of music makers\". In recognition of his many years of human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, and TIME magazine named Gabriel one of the 100 most influential people in the world. AllMusic has described Gabriel as \"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, followed by his induction as a solo artist in 2014.",

            "content": "Scratch My Back is the eighth studio and fourteenth album overall by the English musician Peter Gabriel, his first in eight years. It was released on 12 February 2010 in Australia and Germany, on 15 February in the UK and on 2 March in the U.S. The album, recorded at Air Lyndhurst and Real World Studios during 2009, consists of cover versions of twelve songs by various artists, using only orchestra and voice. It is produced by Gabriel himself with Bob Ezrin.As one reviewer described it, \"covers albums don’t get any more idiosyncratic or high concept than Scratch My Back.\"\n\nScratch My Back is released on compact disc and digital download; a vinyl edition was subsequently released in late March 2010.\n\nThe album performs well on the album charts around the world. Since its release it has peaked at #1 in Belgium, #2 in Germany and Canada, and #3 in the Czech Republic, Italy and Switzerland.It also reached the top 5 in France and Sweden. In Gabriel's native U.K. it peaked at #12 on the UK Albums Chart on 21 February 2010.\n\n\n\nBackground\nThe idea behind the Scratch My Back project is a song exchange where each artist would cover one of Gabriel's songs in return for his covering one of theirs; the other artists' renditions of Gabriel's songs will appear on a later album entitled I'll Scratch Yours.\n\n“ If you’re going to reinterpret something, then really do something. Nail your colors to the mast and say, ‘This is different, and it isn’t everybody’s cup of tea. ” \n—Peter Gabriel, on Scratch My Back.\n \nAccording to Gabriel, although he and arranger John Metcalfe had talked about Arvo Pärt and Steve Reich as inspiration, it was the work that Metcalfe did on \"Heroes\" that \"gave us the confidence to be bold in the way in which we were going to approach the record.\" \"Heroes\" became the opening track because \"without any of the drive of guitar and drums...it builds an enormous tension that bursts open.\"\n\nCover art\nThe cryptic image on the album cover is actually a micrograph of two red blood cells folding over each other, or, depending on your point of view, colliding with each other.The image was shot by photographers David Hiscock and Nadav Kander. Not coincidentally, the name of Gabriel's supporting tour for the album is \"The New Blood Tour\".\n\nTrack listing\n# Title Original artist Length \n1. \"Heroes\"   David Bowie 4:10 \n2. \"The Boy in the Bubble\"   Paul Simon 4:28 \n3. \"Mirrorball\"   Elbow 4:48 \n4. \"Flume\"   Bon Iver 3:01 \n5. \"Listening Wind\"   Talking Heads 4:23 \n6. \"The Power of the Heart\"   Lou Reed 5:52 \n7. \"My Body Is a Cage\"   Arcade Fire 6:13 \n8. \"The Book of Love\"   The Magnetic Fields 3:53 \n9. \"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\"   Randy Newman 2:34 \n10. \"Après moi\"   Regina Spektor 5:13 \n11. \"Philadelphia\"   Neil Young 3:46 \n12. \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\"   Radiohead 5:06 \n\nSpecial Edition bonus disc \n# Title Original artist Length \n1. \"The Book of Love\" (Remix) The Magnetic Fields 3:40 \n2. \"My Body Is a Cage\" (Oxford London Temple version) Arcade Fire 6:03 \n3. \"Waterloo Sunset\" (Oxford London Temple version) The Kinks 3:49 \n4. \"Heroes\" (Wildebeest mix) David Bowie 4:06 \n\nSingles\nThe first split single from the album is \"The Book of Love\" — Gabriel's cover of a Magnetic Fields song, backed with \"Not One of Us\" — Stephin Merritt's (The Magnetic Fields' frontman) cover of a Peter Gabriel song.
