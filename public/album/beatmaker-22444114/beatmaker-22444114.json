      "biography": "Matthew Charles \"Matt\" Berry (born 2 May 1974) is an English actor, writer, comedian and musician. Berry is perhaps best known for his appearances in The IT Crowd, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Mighty Boosh, and Snuff Box. He is renowned for his deep voice; he has voiced several advertisements, most notably for Volvic, The Natural Confectionery Company, Absolute Radio, and MoneySupermarket.\n\nAs a musician, Berry composed all the music for Snuff Box, as well as the music for AD/BC: A Rock Opera, which he co-wrote with Richard Ayoade. AD/BC was a half-hour parody of overblown musicals in general and Jesus Christ Superstar in particular, telling the story of the innkeeper who allowed Mary, Joseph, and the baby Jesus to sleep in his manger. AD/BC was broadcast in December 2004 and featured Fulcher and Mighty Boosh stars Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding. He also performed a song for an episode of Garth Marenghi's Darkplace entitled \"One Track Lover\", a spoof of cheesy romantic 80s songs.",
