  "biography": "1) Brad, from Seattle, Washington, USA, formed officially in 1992 (though the members had been playing together for a long time before that) and in 1993 released their debut album Shame. Brad included 4 friends from the Seattle area who are musicians, including Stone Gossard (of Pearl Jam fame), Regan Hagar (former member of an early grunge band Malfunkshun), Shawn Smith (also a member of Pigeonhed and Satchel) and Jeremy Toback also of ONS.\nWhile often considered simply a side-project of Stone's, Brad had a sound all their own, due to the wide variety of influences brought to the band by its members. The distinctive vocals of Shawn Smith are a major factor in this sound.\n\nShawn Smith contributed on the title-track for the Belgian group Arsenal on their album Lotuk. He spent his 2008 summer touring along with the band.\n\nOrigin \tSeattle, Washington, USA\nGenre(s) \tAlternative rock, neo-psychedelia\nYears active \t1992–present\nLabel(s) \tEpic, Redline\nAssociated acts \tMalfunkshun, Pearl Jam, Satchel, Pigeonhed\nWebsite \twww.bradcorporation.com\nMembers\nStone Gossard\nRegan Hagar\nShawn Smith\nJeremy Toback\nMike Berg\n\n    *  History\n\nBrad formed officially in 1992, although the band members had been playing together for a long time before that. The band's line-up was composed of vocalist Shawn Smith, guitarist Stone Gossard, bassist Jeremy Toback, and drummer Regan Hagar. The band originally wanted to go by the name Shame, however the band found that the name was already taken by a band featuring musician Brad Wilson.[1] Instead, the band took the name Brad and decided to name its debut album Shame. Shame, released on April 27, 1993, was recorded in roughly 20 days, with many tracks taken from in-studio jam sessions. Shame, featuring a raw sound and an eclectic mix of styles, was released to mixed reviews and moderate sales.[2] The track \"20th Century\" was a minor hit in the UK.\n\nThe band's follow-up album, Interiors, released on June 24, 1997, was much more polished. Interiors was met with poor sales, however the band saw its cult audience expand.[2] The single from Interiors, \"The Day Brings\", features Mike McCready from Pearl Jam on lead guitar. The album was accompanied by a tour in the United States that same year, as well as a small tour in Australia and New Zealand in 1998.\n\nA third album, Welcome to Discovery Park, was released on August 13, 2002. The recording of Welcome to Discovery Park saw contributions from Mike Berg, who had taken over as the touring bassist for Toback.[2] The album mixes the rawness of Shame and the polished, produced sound of Interiors. In July 2005, the band released an album of unreleased and incomplete Brad and Satchel tracks called Brad vs Satchel.\n\nAs of January 2006, the band's fourth studio album, tentatively titled Best Friends, had been recorded and was being pared down to a 13-track release.[3] As of September 2007, the album was still awaiting release as the band reunited for a small series of live performances, starting in October 2007, with Kevin Wood (of Malfunkshun) joining the band as an additional guitarist. To date, there has been no indication as to whether this is a permanent personnel move or just a temporary addition. Songs from the forthcoming Best Friends album were played at the 2007 and 2008 performances, but there was no announcement as to when the album would be released.\n\nShawn Smith unfortunately passed away on April 3rd, 2019.\n\n Current members\n\n    * Stone Gossard – guitar\n    * Regan Hagar – drums\n    * Shawn Smith – keyboard, vocals\n    * Jeremy Toback – bass guitar\n    * Mike Berg – bass guitar (1997–present)\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n    * James Hall – guitar, keyboard (1997)\n    * Matt Brown – guitar, keyboard (1997)\n    * Elizabeth Pupo-Walker – percussion (2001–2002)\n    * Thaddeus Turner – guitars, bass (2001–2002)\n    * Kevin Wood – guitar (2007–present)\n\nStudio albums\nYear \tAlbum details\n1993 \tShame\n\n    * Released: April 27, 1993\n    * Label: Epic\n    * Format: CD, cassette (CS)\n\n1997 \tInteriors\n\n    * Released: June 24, 1997\n    * Label: Epic\n    * Format: CD, CS\n\n2002 \tWelcome to Discovery Park\n\n    * Released: August 13, 2002\n    * Label: Redline\n    * Format: CD\n\nCompilations\nYear \tAlbum details\n2005 \tBrad vs Satchel\n\n    * Released: July 26, 2005\n    * Label: The Establishment Store\n    * Format: CD\n\nSingles\nYear \tSingle \tUK peak\nchart position\n[4] \tAlbum\n1993 \t\"Screen\"/\"Buttercup\" \t— \tShame\n\"20th Century\" \t64\n1997 \t\"The Day Brings\" \t— \tInteriors\n\"Secret Girl\" \t—\n2003 \t\"La, La, La\" \t— \tWelcome to Discovery Park\n\"Shinin'\" \t—\n\"Revolution\" \t—\n\"—\" denotes singles that did not chart.\n\nNotes and references\n\n   1. ^ Gumbuoy. \"Hang Out In Discovery Park With Brad\". fasterlouder.com.au.
