  "biography": "The Magpie Salute is an American rock band formed in 2016 by former Black Crowes guitarist Rich Robinson. The band also includes former Black Crowes members Marc Ford and Sven Pipien as well as Rich Robinson band members Matt Slocum, Joe Magistro, Adrien Reju and Katrine Ottosen.\n\nRich Robinson announced the formation of the Magpie Salute in October 2016. In addition to Robinson the group also features former Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford, bassist Sven Pipien and keyboardist Eddie Harsh as well as keyboardists Matt Slocum, drummer Joe Magistro, vocalist Adrien Reju and vocalist Katrine Ottosen from Rich Robinson's solo band. This announcement came on the heels of a series of shows Rich Robinson performed earlier in 2016 in Woodstock, New York where he was joined by Ford, Pipien and Eddie Harsch. Harsch was slated to be a member of the band until his sudden death in November 2016.\n\nThey performed their first concerts in January 2017 at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City. They were originally only scheduled to perform three concerts, but due to demand, they added a fourth show. They performed songs from the Black Crowes as well as Robinson and Ford's solo careers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Magpie+Salute\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
