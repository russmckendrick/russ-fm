A Vtuber project from Algorhythm Project.\n1) Utopia, sometimes known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia, was the band Todd Rundgren formed in the early 70s to play epic progressive rock. Like many progressive bands, they eventually simplified their sound into a sort of sophisticated New Wave and experienced some success in the early MTV era with humorous videos.\n\nThe band as an entity covered all styles of music. From rock, country, pop, classical and beyond.  The vocal ability of the band overall was supreme; with only Queen even coming close to range and flexibility at that time.\n\nAll members are still quite alive and very active with their own projects. Todd Rundgren continuously produces and is always at the cutting edge with computers. Roger Powell works for Apple in a high level position within their music department and Willie Wilcox produces for many  artists. Kasim Sulton has his own bass model and consistenly works in music with numerous artists. \n\nBoth Todd Rundgren and Kasim Sulton participated in the formation of The New Cars, replacing original members Ric Ocasek and the now-deceased Benjamin Orr.  This continued Rundgren's fascination with creating songs and sounds that mimicked other bands' works (see Utopia's Deface the Music for the band's tribute to the Beatles).  The New Cars toured and released one album, which contained only three original songs (all others were live performances of The Cars hits).\n\n2) Utopia is a pop rock band from Bandung, Indonesia. Formed on August 8, 2003, the band consists of Pia (female vocals), Indra (bass), Dodo (guitars), and Tommy (drums). As of now, the band has released three albums (in order of release date): \"Utopia\", \"Kekal\", and \"Indah\".\n\n3) Utopia is a grindcore band from Czech Republic.\n\n4) Utopia is a hip-hop artist from Finland.\n\n5) Utopia is a hardcore punk band from Poland.\n\n6) Utopia is a grunge band from Germany.\n\n7) Utopia is an indie rock band from Lithuania.\n\n8.Utopia is a Vtuber project from Algorhythm Project, have Magnum, Faminè (a Thai Vtuber from ARP), Ivy, Ark <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Utopia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
