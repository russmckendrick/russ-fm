  "biography": "Tacoma Narrows Bridge Disaster are a London based band who create conceptual rock music with metal leanings. They released their first album 'Collapse' in 2009, which Rocksound called 'bruising in the best way possible'.\n\nDespite being named after one of the more memorable tragedies in American history, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Disaster is actually a five-piece “atmospheric art metal” act hailing from London, England. Blending influences of old school rock, heavy metal, and stoner rock with modern progressive elements, TNBD has managed to create a rather unique, mostly instrumental sound. Their second album, entitled Exegesis, will be released on 2-February-2012.\n\nFormed back in 2008, TNBD released their first CD – the all instrumental Collapse – in 2009. The band’s self-described goal is to become an act “that creates epic soundtracks for terrible events”, and in many ways they seem to have succeeded. Their music is intense and moody, heavy and somber. Long instrumental passages and riffs are the backbone of their style, with vocals a secondary thing. Technical and complex, Exegesis (for the curious among you, “exegesis” is defined as “critical explanation or interpretation of a text or portion of a text”) manages to maintain a warm feel thanks to some homespun engineering that gives the release a bit of stoner sludge and a thick, juicy sound. Big riffs and walls of noise are traded off against soft and elegant passages and leaping guitar solos, further cementing TNBD’s uniqueness.\n\nThis band plays together like a truly veteran outfit, handling the many varied tempo changes and complex rhythms flawlessly.\nMusical highlights include: the choppy and intricate rhythm lines of “Fractal World,” the totally guitar driven opener; the building musical intensity of the epic “Exegesis” from a soft guitar piece to a massive wall of sound – a technically brilliant track with top-notch performances from all; the big booming bass line and soaring melodies of “Calligraphy;” and finally Foulcher’s gritty vocal performance and Rainbow’s manic drumming on “Black Iron Prison.”\nThere are few negatives here, none of them at all related to performance or talent. The only real downer is the constant heavy and oppressive tone of the music. Despite a good deal of melody, there is not much cheerfulness or lightness to be heard – the same sober feeling permeates the album from start to finish. It would be nice to hear a bit of brightness somewhere on the release, or a true high energy rocker.\nNot really metal, not fully ambient, and not fully atmospheric, Exegesis is a unique but somber musical journey into the darker reaches of history. While its mostly instrumental nature may keep Tacoma Narrows Bridge Disaster from becoming a household name (as a band anyway), this five-piece is a talented, technically proficient group well worth watching. Their music is as unforgettable as the films of their namesake event.\n\nThey launched their second album, Exegesis, on February 2nd 2012.\n\nCurrent line-up:\n\nAndrew Vernon - Guitars\nAdam Paul - Guitars\nEnrique Serrano - Bass\nAlex Rainbow - Drums\n\nCollapse is available here:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/42ghb48\n\nExegesis is available here:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/78pfaya\n\nwww.bridgedisaster.co.uk is their new web home.
