      "biography": "Beth Orton (born Elizabeth Caroline Orton, 14 December 1970) is a BRIT Award-winning English singer-songwriter, known for her 'folktronica' sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica. She was initially recognised for her collaborations with William Orbit and the Chemical Brothers in the mid 1990s. However, these were not Orton's first recordings. She had released a solo album, Superpinkymandy, in 1993. Since the album was only released in Japan, it went largely unnoticed by international audiences. Her second solo album, Trailer Park, garnered much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the albums Central Reservation (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, Daybreaker. In her 2006 release, Comfort of Strangers, she moved towards a more folk-based sound and away from the electronic sound of her past albums.\n\nAmerican films and television programmes such as Felicity, How to Deal, Charmed, Dawson's Creek, Vanilla Sky and Grey's Anatomy have featured her music and provided her with exposure to a more mainstream American audience.",

There's sweet countrypolitan in “Sweetest Decline” and “Pass in Time”, but the best bits ooze with darkness: the desert hum of “So Much More,” the ominous twang in “Devil Song,” and on the one-take “Feel to Believe,” a furious vocal performance that breaches the limits of the microphone.",
