  "biography": "MUDDY WATERS - APRIL 4, 1913 - APRIL 30, 1983\nAnyone who's followed the course of modern popular music is aware of the vast influence exerted on its development by the large numbers of blues artists who collectively shaped and defined the approach to amplified music in the late 1940s and early '50s. Chicago was the pivotal point for the development and dissemination of the modern blues and virtually everything else has flowed, in one way or another, from this rich source.\n\nThe revolution began inauspiciously enough in 1948 with the release of a 78-rpm single by a singer-guitarist called Muddy Waters. Coupled on Aristocrat 1305 were a pair of traditional Mississippi Delta-styled pieces \"I Cant Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home,\" and on them Waters' dark, majestic singing. Waters' use of amplification gave his guitar playing a new, powerful, striking edge and sonority that introduced to traditional music a sound its listeners found very exciting, comfortably familiar yet strangely compelling and, above all, immensely powerful, urgent.\n\nFrom the start it was he who dominated the music, who led the way-in style, sound, repertoire, instrumentation, in every way-first as a greatly popular club performer from the mid-1940s on and, a few years later, as the most influential recording artist in the new amplified blues idiom. In the years 1948-55 he put forth for definition the fundamental approaches and usages of modern blues in a remarkable series of ground-breaking and, as time has shown, classic records. In the years since, the style Waters delineated has been extended, fragmented, elaborated and otherwise commercialized, but the fundamental earthy, vital, powerful sound of the postwar blues as defined by Muddy and his bandsmen has yet to be excelled-or even equaled, come to that. It's no accident The Rolling Stones chose their name from one of Waters' finest early recordings the choice was merely prophetic, for Muddy and his magnificent bedrock music continue to resonate as thrillingly and powerfully through the music of today as they did back in the late '40s and early '50s when we first heard them.\n\nHe was born McKinley Morganfield-Muddy Waters is a nickname given him in childhood-in the tiny hamlet of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, on April 4, 1913, but from the age of three, when his mother died, was raised by his maternal grandmother in Clarksdale, a small town one hundred miles to the north.\n\nIt is scarcely surprising then that the Delta region has nurtured a tradition of blues singing and playing that reflects the harsh, brutal life there, a music shot through with all the agonized tension, bitterness, stark power and raw passion of life lived at or near the brink of despair. Poised between life and death, the Delta bluesman gave vent to his terror, frustration, rage and passionate humanity in a music that was taut with dark, brooding force and spellbinding intensity that was jagged, harsh, raw as an open wound and profoundly, inexorably, moving. The great Delta blues musicians-Charley Patton, Son House, Tommy Johnson and, especially in Waters' case, the brilliant, tortured Robert Johnson-sang with a naked force, majesty and total conviction that make their music timeless and universal in its power to touch and move us deeply.\n\nGrowing to manhood there, in the very heart of the region that had spawned this magnificent music, Waters was drawn early to its stark, telling, expressive power. He had been working as a farm laborer for several years when at thirteen he took up the harmonica, the instrument on which many blues performers first master the music's rudiments. Four years later he made the switch to guitar. \"You see, I was digging Son House and Robert Johnson.\" The two were the undisputed masters of the region's characteristic \"bottleneck\" style of guitar accompaniment. With this technique the Delta bluesman could utilize the guitar as a perfect extension of his voice, the sliding bottleneck matching the dips, slurs, sliding notes and all the tonal ambiguity of the voice as it is used in singing the blues.\n\nA Within a year, Waters recalled, he had mastered the bottleneck style and the jagged, pulsating rhythms of Delta guitar. He had learned to sing powerfully and expressively in the tightly constricted, pain-filled manner that characterized the best Delta singers. By the time a team of Library of Congress field collectors headed by Alan Lomax visited and recorded Waters for the Library's folksong archives in 1941 (they were looking for Robert Johnson at the time, unaware of his death three years earlier), returning to record him further the following year, he had had several years' local performing experience behind him.\n\nProviding the musical impetus for dancers at rough-and-tumble back country dances, in juke joints, and at picnics, houseparties and other rural entertainments had sharpened the young bluesman's vocal and instrumental abilities to a keen edge. The recordings show the strikingly distinctive power of the young Waters, both as singer and master of Delta bottleneck guitar.\n\nThe following year Muddy put the Delta behind him forever. He moved to Chicago in 1943, and never looked back. But it was not as easy in the Windy City as the young bluesman had imagined. It was the middle of the war and, though times were flush and there was a great deal of money to be earned in the defense industries, the winds of change were blowing uncertainly through the music world.\n\nSpearheading the new blues was Waters. He had persevered with his music. After several years of playing to slowly increasing audiences, first at houseparties and later in small taverns dotted throughout Chicago's huge, sprawling South and West Side black-belt slums, he had begun to record. Ironically enough, it was for Columbia Records that he had made his first recordings as a Chicago bluesman. Unfortunately, the recordings were not issued. Working as a truck driver, Waters had managed to persuade the operators of Aristocrat-later Chess-Records, a small, independent Chicago firm, to record him.\n\nAfter several exploratory recordings made in the company of pianist Sunnyland Slim and bassist Ernest \"Big\" Crawford which made absolutely no impression on the record-buying public, Waters suddenly scored with the single \"I Can't Be Satisfied/I Feel Like Going Home.\" And it is with this record that the history of the modern Chicago blues properly begins. Over the next few years, Waters gathered around him a group of like-minded, country-reared musicians with whom he proceeded to make blues history.\n\nOver the surging rhythmic momentum his group developed so effortlessly, Waters' dark-hued voice chanted the Mississippi blues of his boyhood. In his singing could be heard echoes of the great Delta singers he so admired. Robert Johnson's music, especially, is at the root of so many of Waters' early commercial recordings. But even if the source of the music is not specifically Johnson, it is ultimately based in the traditional blues of his native Mississippi Delta, always the linchpin of Waters' approach to music, as attested by \"Rollin' Stone\" and \"Still A Fool\" (both remarkable reworkings of the Delta standard \"Catfish Blues\"), \"Standing Around Crying,\" \"Rollin' And Tumblin',\" \"Honey Bee,\" among many others.\n\nMuddy WatersFollowing his earliest recordings, made primarily of traditional Mississippi blues staples and his adaptations of them, Muddy slowly broadened the traditional base of his music to incorporate new instrumental sounds and textures. Memorable among these early efforts were the remarkable trio recordings with Little Walter on harmonica and Crawford on bass in support of his incisive amplified bottleneck guitar: \"Louisiana Blues,\" and \"Long Distance Call,\" dating from 1950 or early '51 are justly praised masterpieces of the postwar blues. Waters' regular second guitarist during this period was the empathetic, almost telepathic Jimmy Rogers whose deft, rhythmically unerring playing was unparalleled in the modern blues. A member of Waters' working band from the late 1940s, he was not to make his appearance on a Waters record until the end of 1951, the same time pianist Otis Spann was added to the group's lineup for live performances. With him on board, the modern blues band format and sound was fully settled, documented on such Waters band performances as \"I Just Want To Make Love To You,\" \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"I'm Ready\" (1954), \"Just To Be With You\" (1956) and a host of others.\n\nWith the ensemble finally settled, the final element was added in the form of Willie Dixon the veteran bassist whose abilities as a songwriter of proven talent, versatility and audience-pleasing cleverness enabled Waters to achieve even wider success through the many songs he wrote specifically for, and in some cases helped produce for the singer-guitarist and his crack ensemble. From the middle 1950s Waters' songwriting became almost wholly urban in character, as for example \"She's Nineteen Years Old,\" \"Walkin' Thru The Park,\" \"You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had\" and the anthemic \"Got My Mojo Working,\" among others.\n\nAll through the 1950s Waters solidified and extended his initial success with a series of recordings, many of them absolutely brilliant and none less than satisfying, that firmly established his approach as the dominant postwar blues style. Countless groups emulated its brusque, rude force and thrilling sonorities though few were able to match the peerless ensemble integration it attained so consistently and effortlessly. Members of Waters' various bands-guitarists Jimmy Rogers, Sammy Lawhorn and Luther Johnson, harmonica players Little Walter, Junior Wells and James Cotton, pianists Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins-left to strike out with bands of their own, spreading the Waters gospel further. Later generations of bluesmen took Waters' approach as their birthright: Buddy Guy, Magic Sam, Otis Rush and scores of others-have all been in Waters' debt.\n\nFour decades and more later, the blues of postwar Chicago remain the standard bearers, the yardstick by which all others have been and continue to be measured. Waters, his cohorts and immediate followers had limned definitively the contours of the style, and it was they who extended and reworked the idiom, bringing it to its highest levels. The stage was set for the music's next development, rock-and-roll and its offshoots and permutations.\n\nAs the 1950s gave way to the '60s, blues of the direct, yeasty sort Waters and his bandsmen performed so tellingly became ever less relevant to black listeners who increasingly involved themselves with soul music and its offshoots, the more urbane blues styles of B.B. King and his disciples, and various forms of modern black dance music.\n\nBy this time, however, Waters and other blues performers of his generation had been discovered and taken up by a new audience-young, white and middle-class that had been born of the folk music revival of the late 1950s and swelled even further a few years later by the British blues boom. The bars, taverns and dancehalls of the chitlin' circuit in which he had performed for black dancers and listeners in the previous decade soon had given way to college auditoriums, folksong, blues and jazz clubs and festival stages, both here and abroad, increasing international touring, television appearances and wide acceptance by the rock community, which accorded him the respectful adulation given a founding figure. His young white listeners gained the beauty and majesty of his music.\n\nThrough all this his mentors at Chess Records sought to keep pace with the changing tides in popular music, in response to which they placed Waters in a number of recording contexts they felt would broaden his acceptance even further. The most sensitive and, happily, one of the best received of these productions was the 2-LP set \"Fathers And Sons,\" which paid homage to Waters and his achievements through the sponsorship and participation of several young musicians who had learned directly from him, repaying the favor by using their celebrity to focus attention on him-the brilliant young harmonica player Paul Butterfield and guitarist Michael Bloomfield. In 1977, his long association with Chess at an end, he signed with Blue Sky Records, a label operated by another of his young proteges, the guitarist and singer Johnny Winter, and over the next several years produced four spirited albums under Winter's sympathetic guidance.\n\nMuddy Waters Gettin' DownWaters performed almost uninterruptedly, invariably giving of his best and often, when circumstances conspired to allow it, setting the night on fire with the strength, passion and conviction that only he could muster. He carried his message to countless listeners, first in Chicago, then all the rest of the U.S. and finally, the world. When he died quietly in his sleep on April 30, 1983, in his home in suburban Westmont Illinois, America lost one of the greatest, most influential and enduringly important musicians of the century, one who had reshaped the course of the blues, set it on a new path and, through the influence he exerted on so many other who followed in his trailblazing wake, completely altered the sound, substance and very character of all modern popular music.\n\n-Pete Welding, excerpted from \"Gone to Mainstreet,\" Bluesland, E.P.

His fondness for playing in mud earned him the nickname \"Muddy\" at an early age. He later changed it to \"Muddy Water\" and finally \"Muddy Waters\".\\n\\nWaters was born McKinley Morganfield in Issaquena County, Mississippi in 1913 (He later told people that he was born in 1915 in Rolling Fork, Mississippi; the reason for this remains unknown). His grandmother Della Grant raised him after his mother died in 1918.  Waters started out on harmonica but by age seventeen he was playing the guitar at parties and \"fish fries\", emulating two blues artists who were extremely popular in the south, Son House and Robert Johnson. \"His thick heavy voice, the dark coloration of his tone and his firm almost solid personality were all clearly derived from House,\" wrote Peter Guralnick in Feel Like Going Home, but the embellishments which he added, the imaginative slide technique and more agile rhythms, were closer to Johnson.\"\\n\\nIn 1940 Waters moved to St. Louis before playing with Silas Green a year later and returning back to Mississippi. In the early part of the decade he ran a juke house, complete with gambling, moonshine, a jukebox and live music courtesy of Muddy himself. In the Summer of 1941 Alan Lomax came to Stovall, Mississippi, on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various country blues musicians. \"He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,\" Waters recalled in Rolling Stone, \"and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody\\'s records. Man, you don\\'t know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, `I can do it, I can do it.\\'\" Lomax came back again in July of 1942 to record Waters again. Both sessions were eventually released as Down On Stovall\\'s Plantation on the Testament label.\\n\\nIn 1943 Waters headed north to Chicago in hopes of becoming a full-time professional. He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and playing at night. Big Bill Broonzy was the leading bluesman in Chicago until his death in 1958 and the city was a very competitive market for a newcomer to become established. Broonzy helped Waters out by letting him open Broonzy\\'s show in the rowdy clubs. In 1945 Waters\\'s uncle gave him his first electric guitar, which enabled him to be heard above the noisy crowds. In 1946 Waters recorded some tunes for Mayo Williams at Columbia but they were never released. Later that year he began recording for Aristocrat, a newly-formed label run by two brothers, Leonard and Phil Chess. In 1947 Waters played guitar with Sunnyland Slim on piano on the cuts \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"Little Anna Mae.\" These were also shelved, but in 1948 Waters\\'s \"I Can\\'t Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home\" became big and his popularity in clubs began to take off. Soon after, Aristocrat changed their name to Chess and Waters\\'s signature tune, \"Rollin\\' Stone\", became a smash hit.\\n\\nThe Chess brothers would not allow Waters to use his own musicians (Jimmy Rogers and Blue Smitty) in the studio; instead he was only provided with a backing bass by Big Crawford. However, by 1952 Waters was recording with perhaps the best blues group ever: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica; Jimmy Rogers on guitar; Elgin Evans on drums; Otis Spann on piano; Big Crawford on bass; and Waters handling vocals and second guitar. The band recorded a string of blues classics during the early 1950s with the help of bassist/songwriter Willie Dixon. \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" (Number 8 on the R&B charts), \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" (Number 4), and \"I\\'m Ready\". These three were \"the most macho songs in his repertoire,\" wrote Robert Palmer in Rolling Stone. \"Muddy would never have composed anything so unsubtle. But they gave him a succession of showstoppers and an image, which were important for a bluesman trying to break out of the grind of local gigs into national prominence.\"\\n\\nWaters reigned over the 1950s Chicago blues scene; he was its most popular artist and led its tightest band, fueled by hits from Willie Dixon, its strongest composer. On all these fronts, however, Waters contended with fierce competition from the gravel-voiced singer Howlin\\' Wolf. Wolf\\'s band rivaled Waters\\'s all-star lineup, notably featuring the now-legendary guitarist Hubert Sumlin. Wolf also competed with Waters for the songwriting attention of Willie Dixon and recorded a large number of Dixon tunes. Nonetheless, Waters consistently retained an edge in popularity and esteem. Both Waters and Wolf are held in immense regard by modern rock and blues aficionados, but Waters scored far more chart hits and is generally considered to be the more commercially successful and the more well-known of the two; especially to the casual listener.\\n\\nBy 1954, Waters was at the height of his career. \"By the time he achieved his popular peak, Muddy Waters had become a shouting, declamatory kind of singer who had forsaken his guitar as a kind of anachronism and whose band played with a single pulsating rhythm,\" wrote Guralnick in his Listener\\'s Guide.\\n\\nThe success of Waters\\'s ensemble paved the way for others in his group to break away and enjoy their own solo careers. In 1952 Little Walter left when his single \"Juke\" became a hit (although he would continue to play on Muddy\\'s recording sessions until the late \\'50s), and in 1955 Rogers quit to work exclusively with his own band, which had been a sideline until that time. Waters could never recapture the glory of his pre-1956 years as the pressures of being a leader led him to use various studio musicians for quite a few years thereafter.\\n\\nHe headed to England in 1958 and shocked audiences (whose only previous exposure to blues had come via the acoustic folk/blues sounds of acts such as Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee and Big Bill Broonzy) with loud, amplified electric guitar and a thunderous beat. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960, which was recorded and released as his first live album (see At Newport 1960), helped to turn on a whole new generation to Waters\\' sound. He expressed dismay when he realized that members of his own race were turning their backs to the genre while a Caucasian audience had shown increasing respect for the blues.\\n\\nA major inspiration for the British beat explosion in the 1960s.\\nHowever, for the better part of twenty years (since his last big hit in 1956, \"I\\'m Ready\") Waters was put on the back shelf by the Chess label and recorded albums with various \"popular\" themes: Brass And The Blues, Electric Mud, etc. In 1972 he went back to England to record The London Muddy Waters Sessions with four hotshot rockers—Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell — but their playing wasn\\'t up to his standards. \"These boys are top musicians, they can play with me, put the book before \\'em and play it, you know,\" he told Guralnick. \"But that ain\\'t what I need to sell my people, it ain\\'t the Muddy Waters sound. An if you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man.\"\\n\\nWaters\\'s sound was basically Delta country blues electrified, but his use of microtones, in both his vocals and slide playing, made it extremely difficult to duplicate and follow correctly. \"When I plays onstage with my band, I have to get in there with my guitar and try to bring the sound down to me,\" he said in Rolling Stone. \"But no sooner than I quit playing, it goes back to another, different sound. My blues look so simple, so easy to do, but it\\'s not. They say my blues is the hardest blues in the world to play.\"\\n\\nIn 1977 Johnny Winter convinced his label, Blue Sky, to sign Waters, the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Waters\\'s \"comeback\" LP, Hard Again, was recorded in just two days and was a return to original Chicago sound he had created 25 years earlier. Producer/guitarist Winter pushed Waters to his limit. Former Waters sideman James Cotton contributed harmonica on the Grammy Award-winning album and a brief but well received tour followed. \"He sounds happy, energetic and out for business,\" stated Dan Oppenheimer in Rolling Stone. \"In short, Muddy Waters is kicking in another mule\\'s stall.\"\\n\\nThe importance of Muddy Waters\\' 1977 album Hard Again cannot be overstated, and its place as a near universal favorite in the Muddy Waters catalog is no mistake. Recorded in the last decade of his life, it was the first studio collaboration between Waters and guitarist Johnny Winter, who acted as producer on his last four albums -- the others are I\\'m Ready, King Bee, and Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live -- for Blue Sky, a Columbia subsidiary. The true revelation here is Waters, whose vigor and fire are renewed; he\\'s hungry for the music and completely in possession of his prowess and power as the true King of the Blues. At 64, Waters was revving up for one final go and Winter recorded him like the champ he was. The Muddy Waters Blues Band was one of the crack outfits on the scene at the time and included guitarist Bob Margolin, pianist Pinetop Perkins, and drummer Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith were on this session. Winter was on board playing guitar in addition to producing, and Waters asked James Cotton to play harp on the session and he brought his bassist Charles Calmese for the date. According to Margolin\\'s amazingly warm and informative anecdotal liner notes, Waters never picked up his guitar during these sessions. It hardly matters, from the opening roar of \"Mannish Boy,\" with shouts and hollers throughout, with incendiary guitars to the old-style Delta blues of \"I Can\\'t Be Satisfied,\" with a National steel solo by Winter to Cotton\\'s screeching intro to \"The Blues Had a Baby,\" to the moaning closer \"Little Girl,\" Hard Again is rock solid. Its live feel heralds back to the Chess days, and its cooperative musicianship and intimate, good time vibe have rarely been replicated since that time -- and never on a major label. The expanded reissue includes one bonus track, an outtake called \"Walking Through the Park,\" that could have been part of the original album without a problem -- the other outtake ended up on King Bee. Margolin\\'s notes state that while the album has been remastered, it was not remixed because its sound holds up. This has the feel of an old-time blues record and the listener can hear -- even on CD -- the sound of the wood room it was recorded in as well as the camaraderie of the players. Hard Again showcased Waters as a blues lion, and in its grooves lies all the evidence for the legend he remains.\\n\\nIn 1978 Winter recruited Muddy\\'s cohorts from the early \\'50s Walter Horton and Jimmy Rogers, and brought in the rest of Muddy\\'s touring band at the time (harmonica player Jerry Portnoy, guitarist Luther Johnson, and bassist Calvin Jone) to record Waters\\'s I\\'m Ready LP, which came close to the critical and commercial success of Hard Again.\\n\\nThe comeback continued in 1979 with the lauded LP Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live. \"Muddy was loose for this one,\" wrote Jas Obrecht in Guitar Player, \"and the result is the next best thing to being ringside at one of his foot-thumping, head-nodding, downhome blues shows.\" Accompanied by Johnny Winter and his band, Muddy Waters turns in an enthusiastic performance on Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live. The set list contains most of his biggest hits, and the sound quality and performances are mostly energetic. Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live is a nice addition to the Muddy Waters catalog, but it\\'s not nearly as essential as his earlier work. King Bee the following year concluded Water\\'s reign at Blue Sky and all four LPs turned out to be his biggest-selling albums ever. King Bee was the last album Muddy Waters recorded. Coming last in a trio of triumphant studio outings, and produced by Johnny Winter, it is also a mixed bag. During the sessions for King Bee, Waters, his manager, and his band were all in dispute over money. According to the liner notes by Bob Margolin, the conflict arose from Waters\\' health being on the wane and him playing less. The bandmembers wanted more money for the fewer gigs they did play in order to make ends meet. Ultimately a split occurred and the band quit. Because of the tensions in the studio preceding the split, Winter felt the sessions had not produced enough solid material to yield an entire album. He subsequently filled out King Bee with outtakes from the Hard Again sessions. For the listener, King Bee is a leaner and meaner record. None of the good-time exuberance present on the previous two outings is present here. This is blues, direct and immediate, a snarling, growling album. The title track, \"Mean Old Frisco,\" \"Sad Sad Day,\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home,\" are all solid, razor-sharp blues with killer ensemble work and Waters in fine voice. The Sony Legacy issue features completely remastered sound and Margolin\\'s candid notes, but it also hosts two bonus tracks from the King Bee sessions that Winter didn\\'t see fit to release the first time. There\\'s a redo of \"I Won\\'t Go Down,\" a cut from the \\'50s that Waters sings in his lower baritone roar, and \"Clouds in My Heart,\" a deep, long, sad blues that is one of the great unearthed treasures in Waters catalog. This cut alone with all of its deep emotion and the sound of a band trying to hold the storm of emotions in check and failing is a masterpiece and one of the most amazing blues tunes of the last 30 years. While King Bee may have been considered last and least of Waters\\' Columbia albums, it is more than worth reconsidering.\\n\\nIn 1983 Waters died peacefully and unexpectedly in his sleep, aged 70. At his funeral, throngs of blues musicians showed up to pay tribute to one of the true originals of the art form. \"Muddy was a master of just the right notes,\" John Hammond Jr., told Guitar World. \"It was profound guitar playing, deep and simple. . . . more country blues transposed to the electric guitar, the kind of playing that enhanced the lyrics, gave profundity to the words themselves.\" Following Waters\\'s death, B.B. King told Guitar World, \"It\\'s going to be years and years before most people realize how great he was to American music.\"\\n\\nTwo years after his death, the city that made Muddy Waters (and vice versa) honored their father by changing the name of 43rd Street to Muddy Waters Drive. \\n\\nHe is the father of blues musicians Big Bill Morganfield and Larry \"Mud Morganfield\" Williams.\\n\\nAttesting to the historic place of Muddy Waters in the development of the blues in Mississippi, a Mississippi Blues Trail marker has been placed in Clarksdale by the Mississippi Blues Commission designating the site of Muddy Waters\\' cabin to commemorate his importance.\\n\\nGrammy Awards\\n1971 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording They Call Me Muddy Waters folk MCA/Chess winner \\n1972 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording The London Muddy Waters Session folk MCA/Chess winner \\n1975 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album folk MCA/Chess winner \\n1977 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording Hard Again folk Blue Sky winner \\n1978 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording I\\'m Ready folk Blue Sky winner \\n1979 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live folk Blue Sky winner \\n\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed four songs of Muddy Waters of the 500 songs that shaped rock.\\n1950 Rollin\\' Stone \\n1954 Hoochie Coochie Man \\n1955 Mannish Boy \\n1957 Got My Mojo Working \\n\\nThe Blues Foundation Awards\\n1994 Reissue Album of the Year The Complete Plantation Recordings Winner \\n1995 Reissue Album of the Year One More Mile Winner \\n2000 Traditional Blues Album of the Year The Lost Tapes of Muddy Waters Winner \\n2002 Historical Blues Album of the Year Fathers and Sons Winner \\n2006 Historical Album of the Year Hoochie Coochie Man: Complete Chess Recordings, Volume 2, 1952-1958 Winner \\n\\nInductions\\n1980 Blues Foundation Hall of Fame \\n1987 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame \\n1992 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award \\n\\nU.S. Postage Stamp\\n1994 29 cents Commemorative stamp U.S. Postal Service\\n\\nIn 2004 he was ranked #17 in Rolling Stone Magazine\\'s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Waters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1913 - Westmont, Illinois,  April 30, 1983) was an American blues musician and is generally considered \"the father of Chicago Blues.\" His career spanned over thirty years and he produced what are considered to be some of the finest blues songs ever, such as Hoochie Coochie Man, Mannish Boy and Got My Mojo Working. \\n\\nMuddy Waters is generally considered one of the most influential bluesmen of all time. His fondness for playing in mud earned him the nickname \"Muddy\" at an early age. He later changed it to \"Muddy Water\" and finally \"Muddy Waters\".\\n\\nWaters was born McKinley Morganfield in Issaquena County, Mississippi in 1913 (He later told people that he was born in 1915 in Rolling Fork, Mississippi; the reason for this remains unknown). His grandmother Della Grant raised him after his mother died in 1918.  Waters started out on harmonica but by age seventeen he was playing the guitar at parties and \"fish fries\", emulating two blues artists who were extremely popular in the south, Son House and Robert Johnson. \"His thick heavy voice, the dark coloration of his tone and his firm almost solid personality were all clearly derived from House,\" wrote Peter Guralnick in Feel Like Going Home, but the embellishments which he added, the imaginative slide technique and more agile rhythms, were closer to Johnson.\"\\n\\nIn 1940 Waters moved to St. Louis before playing with Silas Green a year later and returning back to Mississippi. In the early part of the decade he ran a juke house, complete with gambling, moonshine, a jukebox and live music courtesy of Muddy himself. In the Summer of 1941 Alan Lomax came to Stovall, Mississippi, on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various country blues musicians. \"He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,\" Waters recalled in Rolling Stone, \"and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody\\'s records. Man, you don\\'t know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, `I can do it, I can do it.\\'\" Lomax came back again in July of 1942 to record Waters again. Both sessions were eventually released as Down On Stovall\\'s Plantation on the Testament label.\\n\\nIn 1943 Waters headed north to Chicago in hopes of becoming a full-time professional. He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and playing at night. Big Bill Broonzy was the leading bluesman in Chicago until his death in 1958 and the city was a very competitive market for a newcomer to become established. Broonzy helped Waters out by letting him open Broonzy\\'s show in the rowdy clubs. In 1945 Waters\\'s uncle gave him his first electric guitar, which enabled him to be heard above the noisy crowds. In 1946 Waters recorded some tunes for Mayo Williams at Columbia but they were never released. Later that year he began recording for Aristocrat, a newly-formed label run by two brothers, Leonard and Phil Chess. In 1947 Waters played guitar with Sunnyland Slim on piano on the cuts \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"Little Anna Mae.\" These were also shelved, but in 1948 Waters\\'s \"I Can\\'t Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home\" became big and his popularity in clubs began to take off. Soon after, Aristocrat changed their name to Chess and Waters\\'s signature tune, \"Rollin\\' Stone\", became a smash hit.\\n\\nThe Chess brothers would not allow Waters to use his own musicians (Jimmy Rogers and Blue Smitty) in the studio; instead he was only provided with a backing bass by Big Crawford. However, by 1952 Waters was recording with perhaps the best blues group ever: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica; Jimmy Rogers on guitar; Elgin Evans on drums; Otis Spann on piano; Big Crawford on bass; and Waters handling vocals and second guitar. The band recorded a string of blues classics during the early 1950s with the help of bassist/songwriter Willie Dixon. \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" (Number 8 on the R&B charts), \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" (Number 4), and \"I\\'m Ready\". These three were \"the most macho songs in his repertoire,\" wrote Robert Palmer in Rolling Stone. \"Muddy would never have composed anything so unsubtle. But they gave him a succession of showstoppers and an image, which were important for a bluesman trying to break out of the grind of local gigs into national prominence.\"\\n\\nWaters reigned over the 1950s Chicago blues scene; he was its most popular artist and led its tightest band, fueled by hits from Willie Dixon, its strongest composer. On all these fronts, however, Waters contended with fierce competition from the gravel-voiced singer Howlin\\' Wolf. Wolf\\'s band rivaled Waters\\'s all-star lineup, notably featuring the now-legendary guitarist Hubert Sumlin. Wolf also competed with Waters for the songwriting attention of Willie Dixon and recorded a large number of Dixon tunes. Nonetheless, Waters consistently retained an edge in popularity and esteem. Both Waters and Wolf are held in immense regard by modern rock and blues aficionados, but Waters scored far more chart hits and is generally considered to be the more commercially successful and the more well-known of the two; especially to the casual listener.\\n\\nBy 1954, Waters was at the height of his career. \"By the time he achieved his popular peak, Muddy Waters had become a shouting, declamatory kind of singer who had forsaken his guitar as a kind of anachronism and whose band played with a single pulsating rhythm,\" wrote Guralnick in his Listener\\'s Guide.\\n\\nThe success of Waters\\'s ensemble paved the way for others in his group to break away and enjoy their own solo careers. In 1952 Little Walter left when his single \"Juke\" became a hit (although he would continue to play on Muddy\\'s recording sessions until the late \\'50s), and in 1955 Rogers quit to work exclusively with his own band, which had been a sideline until that time. Waters could never recapture the glory of his pre-1956 years as the pressures of being a leader led him to use various studio musicians for quite a few years thereafter.\\n\\nHe headed to England in 1958 and shocked audiences (whose only previous exposure to blues had come via the acoustic folk/blues sounds of acts such as Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee and Big Bill Broonzy) with loud, amplified electric guitar and a thunderous beat. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960, which was recorded and released as his first live album (see At Newport 1960), helped to turn on a whole new generation to Waters\\' sound. He expressed dismay when he realized that members of his own race were turning their backs to the genre while a Caucasian audience had shown increasing respect for the blues.\\n\\nA major inspiration for the British beat explosion in the 1960s.\\nHowever, for the better part of twenty years (since his last big hit in 1956, \"I\\'m Ready\") Waters was put on the back shelf by the Chess label and recorded albums with various \"popular\" themes: Brass And The Blues, Electric Mud, etc. In 1972 he went back to England to record The London Muddy Waters Sessions with four hotshot rockers—Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell — but their playing wasn\\'t up to his standards. \"These boys are top musicians, they can play with me, put the book before \\'em and play it, you know,\" he told Guralnick. \"But that ain\\'t what I need to sell my people, it ain\\'t the Muddy Waters sound. An if you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man.\"\\n\\nWaters\\'s sound was basically Delta country blues electrified, but his use of microtones, in both his vocals and slide playing, made it extremely difficult to duplicate and follow correctly. \"When I plays onstage with my band, I have to get in there with my guitar and try to bring the sound down to me,\" he said in Rolling Stone. \"But no sooner than I quit playing, it goes back to another, different sound. My blues look so simple, so easy to do, but it\\'s not. They say my blues is the hardest blues in the world to play.\"\\n\\nIn 1977 Johnny Winter convinced his label, Blue Sky, to sign Waters, the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Waters\\'s \"comeback\" LP, Hard Again, was recorded in just two days and was a return to original Chicago sound he had created 25 years earlier. Producer/guitarist Winter pushed Waters to his limit. Former Waters sideman James Cotton contributed harmonica on the Grammy Award-winning album and a brief but well received tour followed. \"He sounds happy, energetic and out for business,\" stated Dan Oppenheimer in Rolling Stone. \"In short, Muddy Waters is kicking in another mule\\'s stall.\"\\n\\nThe importance of Muddy Waters\\' 1977 album Hard Again cannot be overstated, and its place as a near universal favorite in the Muddy Waters catalog is no mistake. Recorded in the last decade of his life, it was the first studio collaboration between Waters and guitarist Johnny Winter, who acted as producer on his last four albums -- the others are I\\'m Ready, King Bee, and Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live -- for Blue Sky, a Columbia subsidiary. The true revelation here is Waters, whose vigor and fire are renewed; he\\'s hungry for the music and completely in possession of his prowess and power as the true King of the Blues. At 64, Waters was revving up for one final go and Winter recorded him like the champ he was. The Muddy Waters Blues Band was one of the crack outfits on the scene at the time and included guitarist Bob Margolin, pianist Pinetop Perkins, and drummer Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith were on this session. Winter was on board playing guitar in addition to producing, and Waters asked James Cotton to play harp on the session and he brought his bassist Charles Calmese for the date. According to Margolin\\'s amazingly warm and informative anecdotal liner notes, Waters never picked up his guitar during these sessions. It hardly matters, from the opening roar of \"Mannish Boy,\" with shouts and hollers throughout, with incendiary guitars to the old-style Delta blues of \"I Can\\'t Be Satisfied,\" with a National steel solo by Winter to Cotton\\'s screeching intro to \"The Blues Had a Baby,\" to the moaning closer \"Little Girl,\" Hard Again is rock solid. Its live feel heralds back to the Chess days, and its cooperative musicianship and intimate, good time vibe have rarely been replicated since that time -- and never on a major label. The expanded reissue includes one bonus track, an outtake called \"Walking Through the Park,\" that could have been part of the original album without a problem -- the other outtake ended up on King Bee. Margolin\\'s notes state that while the album has been remastered, it was not remixed because its sound holds up. This has the feel of an old-time blues record and the listener can hear -- even on CD -- the sound of the wood room it was recorded in as well as the camaraderie of the players. Hard Again showcased Waters as a blues lion, and in its grooves lies all the evidence for the legend he remains.\\n\\nIn 1978 Winter recruited Muddy\\'s cohorts from the early \\'50s Walter Horton and Jimmy Rogers, and brought in the rest of Muddy\\'s touring band at the time (harmonica player Jerry Portnoy, guitarist Luther Johnson, and bassist Calvin Jone) to record Waters\\'s I\\'m Ready LP, which came close to the critical and commercial success of Hard Again.\\n\\nThe comeback continued in 1979 with the lauded LP Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live. \"Muddy was loose for this one,\" wrote Jas Obrecht in Guitar Player, \"and the result is the next best thing to being ringside at one of his foot-thumping, head-nodding, downhome blues shows.\" Accompanied by Johnny Winter and his band, Muddy Waters turns in an enthusiastic performance on Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live. The set list contains most of his biggest hits, and the sound quality and performances are mostly energetic. Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live is a nice addition to the Muddy Waters catalog, but it\\'s not nearly as essential as his earlier work. King Bee the following year concluded Water\\'s reign at Blue Sky and all four LPs turned out to be his biggest-selling albums ever. King Bee was the last album Muddy Waters recorded. Coming last in a trio of triumphant studio outings, and produced by Johnny Winter, it is also a mixed bag. During the sessions for King Bee, Waters, his manager, and his band were all in dispute over money. According to the liner notes by Bob Margolin, the conflict arose from Waters\\' health being on the wane and him playing less. The bandmembers wanted more money for the fewer gigs they did play in order to make ends meet. Ultimately a split occurred and the band quit. Because of the tensions in the studio preceding the split, Winter felt the sessions had not produced enough solid material to yield an entire album. He subsequently filled out King Bee with outtakes from the Hard Again sessions. For the listener, King Bee is a leaner and meaner record. None of the good-time exuberance present on the previous two outings is present here. This is blues, direct and immediate, a snarling, growling album. The title track, \"Mean Old Frisco,\" \"Sad Sad Day,\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home,\" are all solid, razor-sharp blues with killer ensemble work and Waters in fine voice. The Sony Legacy issue features completely remastered sound and Margolin\\'s candid notes, but it also hosts two bonus tracks from the King Bee sessions that Winter didn\\'t see fit to release the first time. There\\'s a redo of \"I Won\\'t Go Down,\" a cut from the \\'50s that Waters sings in his lower baritone roar, and \"Clouds in My Heart,\" a deep, long, sad blues that is one of the great unearthed treasures in Waters catalog. This cut alone with all of its deep emotion and the sound of a band trying to hold the storm of emotions in check and failing is a masterpiece and one of the most amazing blues tunes of the last 30 years. While King Bee may have been considered last and least of Waters\\' Columbia albums, it is more than worth reconsidering.\\n\\nIn 1983 Waters died peacefully and unexpectedly in his sleep, aged 70. At his funeral, throngs of blues musicians showed up to pay tribute to one of the true originals of the art form. \"Muddy was a master of just the right notes,\" John Hammond Jr., told Guitar World. \"It was profound guitar playing, deep and simple. . . . more country blues transposed to the electric guitar, the kind of playing that enhanced the lyrics, gave profundity to the words themselves.\" Following Waters\\'s death, B.B. King told Guitar World, \"It\\'s going to be years and years before most people realize how great he was to American music.\"\\n\\nTwo years after his death, the city that made Muddy Waters (and vice versa) honored their father by changing the name of 43rd Street to Muddy Waters Drive. \\n\\nHe is the father of blues musicians Big Bill Morganfield and Larry \"Mud Morganfield\" Williams.\\n\\nAttesting to the historic place of Muddy Waters in the development of the blues in Mississippi, a Mississippi Blues Trail marker has been placed in Clarksdale by the Mississippi Blues Commission designating the site of Muddy Waters\\' cabin to commemorate his importance.\\n\\nGrammy Awards\\n1971 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording They Call Me Muddy Waters folk MCA/Chess winner \\n1972 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording The London Muddy Waters Session folk MCA/Chess winner \\n1975 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album folk MCA/Chess winner \\n1977 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording Hard Again folk Blue Sky winner \\n1978 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording I\\'m Ready folk Blue Sky winner \\n1979 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live folk Blue Sky winner \\n\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed four songs of Muddy Waters of the 500 songs that shaped rock.\\n1950 Rollin\\' Stone \\n1954 Hoochie Coochie Man \\n1955 Mannish Boy \\n1957 Got My Mojo Working \\n\\nThe Blues Foundation Awards\\n1994 Reissue Album of the Year The Complete Plantation Recordings Winner \\n1995 Reissue Album of the Year One More Mile Winner \\n2000 Traditional Blues Album of the Year The Lost Tapes of Muddy Waters Winner \\n2002 Historical Blues Album of the Year Fathers and Sons Winner \\n2006 Historical Album of the Year Hoochie Coochie Man: Complete Chess Recordings, Volume 2, 1952-1958 Winner \\n\\nInductions\\n1980 Blues Foundation Hall of Fame \\n1987 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame \\n1992 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award \\n\\nU.S. Postage Stamp\\n1994 29 cents Commemorative stamp U.S. Postal Service\\n\\nIn 2004 he was ranked #17 in Rolling Stone Magazine\\'s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Waters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_de": "Muddy Waters (* 4. April 1913 in Rolling Fork, Mississippi; † 30. April 1983 in Westmont, Illinois; eigentlich McKinley Morganfield) war einer der einflussreichsten US-amerikanischen Bluesmusiker. Das Rolling Stone Magazine setzt ihn auf Platz 17 der 100 besten Künstler aller Zeiten.\n(Wikipedia)",
      "biography_en": "MUDDY WATERS - APRIL 4, 1913 - APRIL 30, 1983\nAnyone who's followed the course of modern popular music is aware of the vast influence exerted on its development by the large numbers of blues artists who collectively shaped and defined the approach to amplified music in the late 1940s and early '50s. Chicago was the pivotal point for the development and dissemination of the modern blues and virtually everything else has flowed, in one way or another, from this rich source.\n\nThe revolution began inauspiciously enough in 1948 with the release of a 78-rpm single by a singer-guitarist called Muddy Waters. Coupled on Aristocrat 1305 were a pair of traditional Mississippi Delta-styled pieces \"I Cant Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home,\" and on them Waters' dark, majestic singing. Waters' use of amplification gave his guitar playing a new, powerful, striking edge and sonority that introduced to traditional music a sound its listeners found very exciting, comfortably familiar yet strangely compelling and, above all, immensely powerful, urgent.\n\nFrom the start it was he who dominated the music, who led the way-in style, sound, repertoire, instrumentation, in every way-first as a greatly popular club performer from the mid-1940s on and, a few years later, as the most influential recording artist in the new amplified blues idiom. In the years 1948-55 he put forth for definition the fundamental approaches and usages of modern blues in a remarkable series of ground-breaking and, as time has shown, classic records. In the years since, the style Waters delineated has been extended, fragmented, elaborated and otherwise commercialized, but the fundamental earthy, vital, powerful sound of the postwar blues as defined by Muddy and his bandsmen has yet to be excelled-or even equaled, come to that. It's no accident The Rolling Stones chose their name from one of Waters' finest early recordings the choice was merely prophetic, for Muddy and his magnificent bedrock music continue to resonate as thrillingly and powerfully through the music of today as they did back in the late '40s and early '50s when we first heard them.\n\nHe was born McKinley Morganfield-Muddy Waters is a nickname given him in childhood-in the tiny hamlet of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, on April 4, 1913, but from the age of three, when his mother died, was raised by his maternal grandmother in Clarksdale, a small town one hundred miles to the north.\n\nIt is scarcely surprising then that the Delta region has nurtured a tradition of blues singing and playing that reflects the harsh, brutal life there, a music shot through with all the agonized tension, bitterness, stark power and raw passion of life lived at or near the brink of despair. Poised between life and death, the Delta bluesman gave vent to his terror, frustration, rage and passionate humanity in a music that was taut with dark, brooding force and spellbinding intensity that was jagged, harsh, raw as an open wound and profoundly, inexorably, moving. The great Delta blues musicians-Charley Patton, Son House, Tommy Johnson and, especially in Waters' case, the brilliant, tortured Robert Johnson-sang with a naked force, majesty and total conviction that make their music timeless and universal in its power to touch and move us deeply.\n\nGrowing to manhood there, in the very heart of the region that had spawned this magnificent music, Waters was drawn early to its stark, telling, expressive power. He had been working as a farm laborer for several years when at thirteen he took up the harmonica, the instrument on which many blues performers first master the music's rudiments. Four years later he made the switch to guitar. \"You see, I was digging Son House and Robert Johnson.\" The two were the undisputed masters of the region's characteristic \"bottleneck\" style of guitar accompaniment. With this technique the Delta bluesman could utilize the guitar as a perfect extension of his voice, the sliding bottleneck matching the dips, slurs, sliding notes and all the tonal ambiguity of the voice as it is used in singing the blues.\n\nA Within a year, Waters recalled, he had mastered the bottleneck style and the jagged, pulsating rhythms of Delta guitar. He had learned to sing powerfully and expressively in the tightly constricted, pain-filled manner that characterized the best Delta singers. By the time a team of Library of Congress field collectors headed by Alan Lomax visited and recorded Waters for the Library's folksong archives in 1941 (they were looking for Robert Johnson at the time, unaware of his death three years earlier), returning to record him further the following year, he had had several years' local performing experience behind him.\n\nProviding the musical impetus for dancers at rough-and-tumble back country dances, in juke joints, and at picnics, houseparties and other rural entertainments had sharpened the young bluesman's vocal and instrumental abilities to a keen edge. The recordings show the strikingly distinctive power of the young Waters, both as singer and master of Delta bottleneck guitar.\n\nThe following year Muddy put the Delta behind him forever. He moved to Chicago in 1943, and never looked back. But it was not as easy in the Windy City as the young bluesman had imagined. It was the middle of the war and, though times were flush and there was a great deal of money to be earned in the defense industries, the winds of change were blowing uncertainly through the music world.\n\nSpearheading the new blues was Waters. He had persevered with his music. After several years of playing to slowly increasing audiences, first at houseparties and later in small taverns dotted throughout Chicago's huge, sprawling South and West Side black-belt slums, he had begun to record. Ironically enough, it was for Columbia Records that he had made his first recordings as a Chicago bluesman. Unfortunately, the recordings were not issued. Working as a truck driver, Waters had managed to persuade the operators of Aristocrat-later Chess-Records, a small, independent Chicago firm, to record him.\n\nAfter several exploratory recordings made in the company of pianist Sunnyland Slim and bassist Ernest \"Big\" Crawford which made absolutely no impression on the record-buying public, Waters suddenly scored with the single \"I Can't Be Satisfied/I Feel Like Going Home.\" And it is with this record that the history of the modern Chicago blues properly begins. Over the next few years, Waters gathered around him a group of like-minded, country-reared musicians with whom he proceeded to make blues history.\n\nOver the surging rhythmic momentum his group developed so effortlessly, Waters' dark-hued voice chanted the Mississippi blues of his boyhood. In his singing could be heard echoes of the great Delta singers he so admired. Robert Johnson's music, especially, is at the root of so many of Waters' early commercial recordings. But even if the source of the music is not specifically Johnson, it is ultimately based in the traditional blues of his native Mississippi Delta, always the linchpin of Waters' approach to music, as attested by \"Rollin' Stone\" and \"Still A Fool\" (both remarkable reworkings of the Delta standard \"Catfish Blues\"), \"Standing Around Crying,\" \"Rollin' And Tumblin',\" \"Honey Bee,\" among many others.\n\nMuddy WatersFollowing his earliest recordings, made primarily of traditional Mississippi blues staples and his adaptations of them, Muddy slowly broadened the traditional base of his music to incorporate new instrumental sounds and textures. Memorable among these early efforts were the remarkable trio recordings with Little Walter on harmonica and Crawford on bass in support of his incisive amplified bottleneck guitar: \"Louisiana Blues,\" and \"Long Distance Call,\" dating from 1950 or early '51 are justly praised masterpieces of the postwar blues. Waters' regular second guitarist during this period was the empathetic, almost telepathic Jimmy Rogers whose deft, rhythmically unerring playing was unparalleled in the modern blues. A member of Waters' working band from the late 1940s, he was not to make his appearance on a Waters record until the end of 1951, the same time pianist Otis Spann was added to the group's lineup for live performances. With him on board, the modern blues band format and sound was fully settled, documented on such Waters band performances as \"I Just Want To Make Love To You,\" \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"I'm Ready\" (1954), \"Just To Be With You\" (1956) and a host of others.\n\nWith the ensemble finally settled, the final element was added in the form of Willie Dixon the veteran bassist whose abilities as a songwriter of proven talent, versatility and audience-pleasing cleverness enabled Waters to achieve even wider success through the many songs he wrote specifically for, and in some cases helped produce for the singer-guitarist and his crack ensemble. From the middle 1950s Waters' songwriting became almost wholly urban in character, as for example \"She's Nineteen Years Old,\" \"Walkin' Thru The Park,\" \"You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had\" and the anthemic \"Got My Mojo Working,\" among others.\n\nAll through the 1950s Waters solidified and extended his initial success with a series of recordings, many of them absolutely brilliant and none less than satisfying, that firmly established his approach as the dominant postwar blues style. Countless groups emulated its brusque, rude force and thrilling sonorities though few were able to match the peerless ensemble integration it attained so consistently and effortlessly. Members of Waters' various bands-guitarists Jimmy Rogers, Sammy Lawhorn and Luther Johnson, harmonica players Little Walter, Junior Wells and James Cotton, pianists Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins-left to strike out with bands of their own, spreading the Waters gospel further. Later generations of bluesmen took Waters' approach as their birthright: Buddy Guy, Magic Sam, Otis Rush and scores of others-have all been in Waters' debt.\n\nFour decades and more later, the blues of postwar Chicago remain the standard bearers, the yardstick by which all others have been and continue to be measured. Waters, his cohorts and immediate followers had limned definitively the contours of the style, and it was they who extended and reworked the idiom, bringing it to its highest levels. The stage was set for the music's next development, rock-and-roll and its offshoots and permutations.\n\nAs the 1950s gave way to the '60s, blues of the direct, yeasty sort Waters and his bandsmen performed so tellingly became ever less relevant to black listeners who increasingly involved themselves with soul music and its offshoots, the more urbane blues styles of B.B. King and his disciples, and various forms of modern black dance music.\n\nBy this time, however, Waters and other blues performers of his generation had been discovered and taken up by a new audience-young, white and middle-class that had been born of the folk music revival of the late 1950s and swelled even further a few years later by the British blues boom. The bars, taverns and dancehalls of the chitlin' circuit in which he had performed for black dancers and listeners in the previous decade soon had given way to college auditoriums, folksong, blues and jazz clubs and festival stages, both here and abroad, increasing international touring, television appearances and wide acceptance by the rock community, which accorded him the respectful adulation given a founding figure. His young white listeners gained the beauty and majesty of his music.\n\nThrough all this his mentors at Chess Records sought to keep pace with the changing tides in popular music, in response to which they placed Waters in a number of recording contexts they felt would broaden his acceptance even further. The most sensitive and, happily, one of the best received of these productions was the 2-LP set \"Fathers And Sons,\" which paid homage to Waters and his achievements through the sponsorship and participation of several young musicians who had learned directly from him, repaying the favor by using their celebrity to focus attention on him-the brilliant young harmonica player Paul Butterfield and guitarist Michael Bloomfield. In 1977, his long association with Chess at an end, he signed with Blue Sky Records, a label operated by another of his young proteges, the guitarist and singer Johnny Winter, and over the next several years produced four spirited albums under Winter's sympathetic guidance.\n\nMuddy Waters Gettin' DownWaters performed almost uninterruptedly, invariably giving of his best and often, when circumstances conspired to allow it, setting the night on fire with the strength, passion and conviction that only he could muster. He carried his message to countless listeners, first in Chicago, then all the rest of the U.S. and finally, the world. When he died quietly in his sleep on April 30, 1983, in his home in suburban Westmont Illinois, America lost one of the greatest, most influential and enduringly important musicians of the century, one who had reshaped the course of the blues, set it on a new path and, through the influence he exerted on so many other who followed in his trailblazing wake, completely altered the sound, substance and very character of all modern popular music.\n\n-Pete Welding, excerpted from \"Gone to Mainstreet,\" Bluesland, E.P. Dutton, 1992",
      "biography_es": "Cualquiera que haya seguido el curso de la música popular moderna es consciente de la gran influencia ejercida en su desarrollo por un gran número de artistas de blues que colectivamente dieron forma y definieron el enfoque de la música amplificada a fines de la década de 1940 y principios de la de 1950. Chicago fue el punto central para el desarrollo y la difusión del blues moderno y prácticamente todo lo demás ha fluido, de una forma u otra, de esta rica fuente.\n\nLa revolución comenzó de manera bastante desfavorable en 1948 con el lanzamiento de un sencillo de 78 rpm de un cantante y guitarrista llamado Muddy Waters. Junto con Aristocrat 1305 había un par de piezas tradicionales del estilo del delta del Misisipi \"I Cant Be Satisfied\" y \"I Feel Like Going Home\", y en ellas el canto oscuro y majestuoso de Waters. El uso de la amplificación por parte de Waters le dio a su forma de tocar la guitarra una sonoridad y una sonoridad nuevas, poderosas y sorprendentes que introdujeron en la música tradicional un sonido que sus oyentes encontraban muy emocionante, cómodamente familiar pero extrañamente convincente y, sobre todo, inmensamente poderoso, urgente.\n\nDesde el principio fue él quien dominó la música, quien abrió el camino -en estilo, sonido, repertorio, instrumentación, en todos los sentidos- primero como un intérprete de club muy popular desde mediados de la década de 1940 en adelante y, unos años más tarde, como el artista discográfico más influyente en el nuevo idioma del blues amplificado. En los años 1948-55, presentó para definir los enfoques y usos fundamentales del blues moderno en una notable serie de discos innovadores y, como lo ha demostrado el tiempo, clásicos. En los años transcurridos desde entonces, el estilo delineado por Waters se ha ampliado, fragmentado, elaborado y comercializado de otra manera, pero el sonido fundamental terrenal, vital y poderoso del blues de la posguerra, tal como lo definen Muddy y sus miembros de la banda, aún no se ha superado, o incluso igualado. ven a eso No es casualidad que los Rolling Stones eligieran su nombre de una de las mejores primeras grabaciones de Waters; la elección fue meramente profética, ya que Muddy y su magnífica música de base continúan resonando tan emocionante y poderosamente a través de la música de hoy como lo hicieron a finales de ' 40 y principios de los 50 cuando los escuchamos por primera vez.\n\nNació McKinley Morganfield -Muddy Waters es un apodo que le pusieron en la infancia- en la diminuta aldea de Rolling Fork, Mississippi, el 4 de abril de 1913, pero desde los tres años, cuando murió su madre, fue criado por su abuela materna. en Clarksdale, un pequeño pueblo cien millas al norte.",
      "biography_fr": "McKinley Morganfield (né à Rolling Fork, Mississippi le 4 avril 1913 - mort à Westmont, Illinois le 30 avril 1983), plus connu sous le nom de Muddy Waters, est un musicien américain de blues. Il est l'une des figures historiques du Chicago Blues.\n\nMuddy Waters enregistre pour la première fois dans une plantation du Delta du Mississippi, avec Alan Lomax, pour la Bibliothèque du Congrès, en 1940. Il part plus tard pour Chicago, où il change sa guitare acoustique pour une électrique, ajoutant une section rythmique et un harmonica pour former les Chicago Blues. Son groupe joue dans la banlieue ouest de Chicago, avant de rejoindre Chess Records. Ses débuts en tant que bluesman à Chicago ne sont pas évidents, il doit s'y reprendre à trois reprises devant Leonard Chess, patron de Chess Records, avant de signer enfin un contrat pour ses disques. En 1954, il s'installe avec sa famille au 4339 S. Lake Park Avenue où il accueille volontiers d'autres musiciens, comme Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry pour des répétitions ou des jam sessions. Le pianiste Otis Spann et l'harmoniciste Paul Oscher, qui font partie du groupe de Muddy Waters, vivent quelque temps dans le sous-sol de la maison. En 1974, Muddy Waters quitte cette maison et s'installe à Westmont.\nSon influence est énorme sur de nombreux genres musicaux : blues, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, jazz, et country. Waters aidera Chuck Berry à obtenir son premier contrat d'enregistrement.\nSes concerts en Angleterre au début des années 1960, font entendre pour la première fois un groupe de Chicago Blues. Les Rolling Stones décidèrent de s'appeler ainsi à cause de la chanson de Waters Rollin Stone, aussi connue sous le nom de Catfish Blues. Un des grands succès de Led Zeppelin, Whole Lotta Love, était basé sur une chanson de Muddy Waters You Need Love, écrite par Willie Dixon. Ce dernier écrira d'ailleurs plusieurs des chansons les plus connues de Muddy, comme I Just Want to Make Love to You, Hoochie Coochie Man, et I'm Ready.\nSouvent opposé lors de sa carrière à Howlin' Wolf, autre artiste de Chess Records qui fut l'un de ses meilleurs rivaux, il comptera dans son groupe de nombreux harmonicistes de renom notamment Little Walter qui partira faire une carrière solo et James Cotton.\nOn peut aussi citer des chansons ayant contribué au succès de Muddy Waters telles que Long Distance Call, Mannish Boy, et le blues-rock I've Got My Mojo Working et bien sûr, Rollin' Stone.\nMuddy Waters est mort à l'âge de 70 ans et est enterré au cimetière de Restvale, à Alsip dans l'Illinois, en banlieue de Chicago. Son fils \"Big Bill\" Morganfield est également guitariste ; on a pu le voir jouer pour Tom Waits le soir du 9 juillet 2012 à New York, lors de l'émission de David Letterman.",

      "bio_content": "Muddy Waters (McKinley Morganfield, Issaquena County, Mississippi, April 4, 1913 - Westmont, Illinois,  April 30, 1983) was an American blues musician and is generally considered \"the father of Chicago Blues.\" His career spanned over thirty years and he produced what are considered to be some of the finest blues songs ever, such as Hoochie Coochie Man, Mannish Boy and Got My Mojo Working. \n\nMuddy Waters is generally considered one of the most influential bluesmen of all time. His fondness for playing in mud earned him the nickname \"Muddy\" at an early age. He later changed it to \"Muddy Water\" and finally \"Muddy Waters\".\n\nWaters was born McKinley Morganfield in Issaquena County, Mississippi in 1913 (He later told people that he was born in 1915 in Rolling Fork, Mississippi; the reason for this remains unknown). His grandmother Della Grant raised him after his mother died in 1918.  Waters started out on harmonica but by age seventeen he was playing the guitar at parties and \"fish fries\", emulating two blues artists who were extremely popular in the south, Son House and Robert Johnson. \"His thick heavy voice, the dark coloration of his tone and his firm almost solid personality were all clearly derived from House,\" wrote Peter Guralnick in Feel Like Going Home, but the embellishments which he added, the imaginative slide technique and more agile rhythms, were closer to Johnson.\"\n\nIn 1940 Waters moved to St. Louis before playing with Silas Green a year later and returning back to Mississippi. In the early part of the decade he ran a juke house, complete with gambling, moonshine, a jukebox and live music courtesy of Muddy himself. In the Summer of 1941 Alan Lomax came to Stovall, Mississippi, on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various country blues musicians. \"He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,\" Waters recalled in Rolling Stone, \"and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody's records. Man, you don't know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, `I can do it, I can do it.'\" Lomax came back again in July of 1942 to record Waters again. Both sessions were eventually released as Down On Stovall's Plantation on the Testament label.\n\nIn 1943 Waters headed north to Chicago in hopes of becoming a full-time professional. He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and playing at night. Big Bill Broonzy was the leading bluesman in Chicago until his death in 1958 and the city was a very competitive market for a newcomer to become established. Broonzy helped Waters out by letting him open Broonzy's show in the rowdy clubs. In 1945 Waters's uncle gave him his first electric guitar, which enabled him to be heard above the noisy crowds. In 1946 Waters recorded some tunes for Mayo Williams at Columbia but they were never released. Later that year he began recording for Aristocrat, a newly-formed label run by two brothers, Leonard and Phil Chess. In 1947 Waters played guitar with Sunnyland Slim on piano on the cuts \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"Little Anna Mae.\" These were also shelved, but in 1948 Waters's \"I Can't Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home\" became big and his popularity in clubs began to take off. Soon after, Aristocrat changed their name to Chess and Waters's signature tune, \"Rollin' Stone\", became a smash hit.\n\nThe Chess brothers would not allow Waters to use his own musicians (Jimmy Rogers and Blue Smitty) in the studio; instead he was only provided with a backing bass by Big Crawford. However, by 1952 Waters was recording with perhaps the best blues group ever: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica; Jimmy Rogers on guitar; Elgin Evans on drums; Otis Spann on piano; Big Crawford on bass; and Waters handling vocals and second guitar. The band recorded a string of blues classics during the early 1950s with the help of bassist/songwriter Willie Dixon. \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" (Number 8 on the R&B charts), \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" (Number 4), and \"I'm Ready\". These three were \"the most macho songs in his repertoire,\" wrote Robert Palmer in Rolling Stone. \"Muddy would never have composed anything so unsubtle. But they gave him a succession of showstoppers and an image, which were important for a bluesman trying to break out of the grind of local gigs into national prominence.\"\n\nWaters reigned over the 1950s Chicago blues scene; he was its most popular artist and led its tightest band, fueled by hits from Willie Dixon, its strongest composer. On all these fronts, however, Waters contended with fierce competition from the gravel-voiced singer Howlin' Wolf. Wolf's band rivaled Waters's all-star lineup, notably featuring the now-legendary guitarist Hubert Sumlin. Wolf also competed with Waters for the songwriting attention of Willie Dixon and recorded a large number of Dixon tunes. Nonetheless, Waters consistently retained an edge in popularity and esteem. Both Waters and Wolf are held in immense regard by modern rock and blues aficionados, but Waters scored far more chart hits and is generally considered to be the more commercially successful and the more well-known of the two; especially to the casual listener.\n\nBy 1954, Waters was at the height of his career. \"By the time he achieved his popular peak, Muddy Waters had become a shouting, declamatory kind of singer who had forsaken his guitar as a kind of anachronism and whose band played with a single pulsating rhythm,\" wrote Guralnick in his Listener's Guide.\n\nThe success of Waters's ensemble paved the way for others in his group to break away and enjoy their own solo careers. In 1952 Little Walter left when his single \"Juke\" became a hit (although he would continue to play on Muddy's recording sessions until the late '50s), and in 1955 Rogers quit to work exclusively with his own band, which had been a sideline until that time. Waters could never recapture the glory of his pre-1956 years as the pressures of being a leader led him to use various studio musicians for quite a few years thereafter.\n\nHe headed to England in 1958 and shocked audiences (whose only previous exposure to blues had come via the acoustic folk/blues sounds of acts such as Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee and Big Bill Broonzy) with loud, amplified electric guitar and a thunderous beat. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960, which was recorded and released as his first live album (see At Newport 1960), helped to turn on a whole new generation to Waters' sound. He expressed dismay when he realized that members of his own race were turning their backs to the genre while a Caucasian audience had shown increasing respect for the blues.\n\nA major inspiration for the British beat explosion in the 1960s.\nHowever, for the better part of twenty years (since his last big hit in 1956, \"I'm Ready\") Waters was put on the back shelf by the Chess label and recorded albums with various \"popular\" themes: Brass And The Blues, Electric Mud, etc. In 1972 he went back to England to record The London Muddy Waters Sessions with four hotshot rockers—Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell — but their playing wasn't up to his standards. \"These boys are top musicians, they can play with me, put the book before 'em and play it, you know,\" he told Guralnick. \"But that ain't what I need to sell my people, it ain't the Muddy Waters sound. An if you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man.\"\n\nWaters's sound was basically Delta country blues electrified, but his use of microtones, in both his vocals and slide playing, made it extremely difficult to duplicate and follow correctly. \"When I plays onstage with my band, I have to get in there with my guitar and try to bring the sound down to me,\" he said in Rolling Stone. \"But no sooner than I quit playing, it goes back to another, different sound. My blues look so simple, so easy to do, but it's not. They say my blues is the hardest blues in the world to play.\"\n\nIn 1977 Johnny Winter convinced his label, Blue Sky, to sign Waters, the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Waters's \"comeback\" LP, Hard Again, was recorded in just two days and was a return to original Chicago sound he had created 25 years earlier. Producer/guitarist Winter pushed Waters to his limit. Former Waters sideman James Cotton contributed harmonica on the Grammy Award-winning album and a brief but well received tour followed. \"He sounds happy, energetic and out for business,\" stated Dan Oppenheimer in Rolling Stone. \"In short, Muddy Waters is kicking in another mule's stall.\"\n\nThe importance of Muddy Waters' 1977 album Hard Again cannot be overstated, and its place as a near universal favorite in the Muddy Waters catalog is no mistake. Recorded in the last decade of his life, it was the first studio collaboration between Waters and guitarist Johnny Winter, who acted as producer on his last four albums -- the others are I'm Ready, King Bee, and Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live -- for Blue Sky, a Columbia subsidiary. The true revelation here is Waters, whose vigor and fire are renewed; he's hungry for the music and completely in possession of his prowess and power as the true King of the Blues. At 64, Waters was revving up for one final go and Winter recorded him like the champ he was. The Muddy Waters Blues Band was one of the crack outfits on the scene at the time and included guitarist Bob Margolin, pianist Pinetop Perkins, and drummer Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith were on this session. Winter was on board playing guitar in addition to producing, and Waters asked James Cotton to play harp on the session and he brought his bassist Charles Calmese for the date. According to Margolin's amazingly warm and informative anecdotal liner notes, Waters never picked up his guitar during these sessions. It hardly matters, from the opening roar of \"Mannish Boy,\" with shouts and hollers throughout, with incendiary guitars to the old-style Delta blues of \"I Can't Be Satisfied,\" with a National steel solo by Winter to Cotton's screeching intro to \"The Blues Had a Baby,\" to the moaning closer \"Little Girl,\" Hard Again is rock solid. Its live feel heralds back to the Chess days, and its cooperative musicianship and intimate, good time vibe have rarely been replicated since that time -- and never on a major label. The expanded reissue includes one bonus track, an outtake called \"Walking Through the Park,\" that could have been part of the original album without a problem -- the other outtake ended up on King Bee. Margolin's notes state that while the album has been remastered, it was not remixed because its sound holds up. This has the feel of an old-time blues record and the listener can hear -- even on CD -- the sound of the wood room it was recorded in as well as the camaraderie of the players. Hard Again showcased Waters as a blues lion, and in its grooves lies all the evidence for the legend he remains.\n\nIn 1978 Winter recruited Muddy's cohorts from the early '50s Walter Horton and Jimmy Rogers, and brought in the rest of Muddy's touring band at the time (harmonica player Jerry Portnoy, guitarist Luther Johnson, and bassist Calvin Jone) to record Waters's I'm Ready LP, which came close to the critical and commercial success of Hard Again.\n\nThe comeback continued in 1979 with the lauded LP Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live. \"Muddy was loose for this one,\" wrote Jas Obrecht in Guitar Player, \"and the result is the next best thing to being ringside at one of his foot-thumping, head-nodding, downhome blues shows.\" Accompanied by Johnny Winter and his band, Muddy Waters turns in an enthusiastic performance on Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live. The set list contains most of his biggest hits, and the sound quality and performances are mostly energetic. Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live is a nice addition to the Muddy Waters catalog, but it's not nearly as essential as his earlier work. King Bee the following year concluded Water's reign at Blue Sky and all four LPs turned out to be his biggest-selling albums ever. King Bee was the last album Muddy Waters recorded. Coming last in a trio of triumphant studio outings, and produced by Johnny Winter, it is also a mixed bag. During the sessions for King Bee, Waters, his manager, and his band were all in dispute over money. According to the liner notes by Bob Margolin, the conflict arose from Waters' health being on the wane and him playing less. The bandmembers wanted more money for the fewer gigs they did play in order to make ends meet. Ultimately a split occurred and the band quit. Because of the tensions in the studio preceding the split, Winter felt the sessions had not produced enough solid material to yield an entire album. He subsequently filled out King Bee with outtakes from the Hard Again sessions. For the listener, King Bee is a leaner and meaner record. None of the good-time exuberance present on the previous two outings is present here. This is blues, direct and immediate, a snarling, growling album. The title track, \"Mean Old Frisco,\" \"Sad Sad Day,\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home,\" are all solid, razor-sharp blues with killer ensemble work and Waters in fine voice. The Sony Legacy issue features completely remastered sound and Margolin's candid notes, but it also hosts two bonus tracks from the King Bee sessions that Winter didn't see fit to release the first time. There's a redo of \"I Won't Go Down,\" a cut from the '50s that Waters sings in his lower baritone roar, and \"Clouds in My Heart,\" a deep, long, sad blues that is one of the great unearthed treasures in Waters catalog. This cut alone with all of its deep emotion and the sound of a band trying to hold the storm of emotions in check and failing is a masterpiece and one of the most amazing blues tunes of the last 30 years. While King Bee may have been considered last and least of Waters' Columbia albums, it is more than worth reconsidering.\n\nIn 1983 Waters died peacefully and unexpectedly in his sleep, aged 70. At his funeral, throngs of blues musicians showed up to pay tribute to one of the true originals of the art form. \"Muddy was a master of just the right notes,\" John Hammond Jr., told Guitar World. \"It was profound guitar playing, deep and simple. . . . more country blues transposed to the electric guitar, the kind of playing that enhanced the lyrics, gave profundity to the words themselves.\" Following Waters's death, B.B. King told Guitar World, \"It's going to be years and years before most people realize how great he was to American music.\"\n\nTwo years after his death, the city that made Muddy Waters (and vice versa) honored their father by changing the name of 43rd Street to Muddy Waters Drive. \n\nHe is the father of blues musicians Big Bill Morganfield and Larry \"Mud Morganfield\" Williams.\n\nAttesting to the historic place of Muddy Waters in the development of the blues in Mississippi, a Mississippi Blues Trail marker has been placed in Clarksdale by the Mississippi Blues Commission designating the site of Muddy Waters' cabin to commemorate his importance.\n\nGrammy Awards\n1971 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording They Call Me Muddy Waters folk MCA/Chess winner \n1972 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording The London Muddy Waters Session folk MCA/Chess winner \n1975 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album folk MCA/Chess winner \n1977 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording Hard Again folk Blue Sky winner \n1978 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording I'm Ready folk Blue Sky winner \n1979 Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live folk Blue Sky winner \n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed four songs of Muddy Waters of the 500 songs that shaped rock.\n1950 Rollin' Stone \n1954 Hoochie Coochie Man \n1955 Mannish Boy \n1957 Got My Mojo Working \n\nThe Blues Foundation Awards\n1994 Reissue Album of the Year The Complete Plantation Recordings Winner \n1995 Reissue Album of the Year One More Mile Winner \n2000 Traditional Blues Album of the Year The Lost Tapes of Muddy Waters Winner \n2002 Historical Blues Album of the Year Fathers and Sons Winner \n2006 Historical Album of the Year Hoochie Coochie Man: Complete Chess Recordings, Volume 2, 1952-1958 Winner \n\nInductions\n1980 Blues Foundation Hall of Fame \n1987 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame \n1992 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award \n\nU.S. Postage Stamp\n1994 29 cents Commemorative stamp U.S. Postal Service\n\nIn 2004 he was ranked #17 in Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Waters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

April 1983 in Westmont, Illinois; eigentlich McKinley Morganfield) war einer der einflussreichsten US-amerikanischen Bluesmusiker. Das Rolling Stone Magazine setzt ihn auf Platz 17 der 100 besten Künstler aller Zeiten.\n(Wikipedia)",
      "biography_en": "MUDDY WATERS - APRIL 4, 1913 - APRIL 30, 1983\nAnyone who's followed the course of modern popular music is aware of the vast influence exerted on its development by the large numbers of blues artists who collectively shaped and defined the approach to amplified music in the late 1940s and early '50s. Chicago was the pivotal point for the development and dissemination of the modern blues and virtually everything else has flowed, in one way or another, from this rich source.\n\nThe revolution began inauspiciously enough in 1948 with the release of a 78-rpm single by a singer-guitarist called Muddy Waters. Coupled on Aristocrat 1305 were a pair of traditional Mississippi Delta-styled pieces \"I Cant Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home,\" and on them Waters' dark, majestic singing. Waters' use of amplification gave his guitar playing a new, powerful, striking edge and sonority that introduced to traditional music a sound its listeners found very exciting, comfortably familiar yet strangely compelling and, above all, immensely powerful, urgent.\n\nFrom the start it was he who dominated the music, who led the way-in style, sound, repertoire, instrumentation, in every way-first as a greatly popular club performer from the mid-1940s on and, a few years later, as the most influential recording artist in the new amplified blues idiom. In the years 1948-55 he put forth for definition the fundamental approaches and usages of modern blues in a remarkable series of ground-breaking and, as time has shown, classic records. In the years since, the style Waters delineated has been extended, fragmented, elaborated and otherwise commercialized, but the fundamental earthy, vital, powerful sound of the postwar blues as defined by Muddy and his bandsmen has yet to be excelled-or even equaled, come to that. It's no accident The Rolling Stones chose their name from one of Waters' finest early recordings the choice was merely prophetic, for Muddy and his magnificent bedrock music continue to resonate as thrillingly and powerfully through the music of today as they did back in the late '40s and early '50s when we first heard them.\n\nHe was born McKinley Morganfield-Muddy Waters is a nickname given him in childhood-in the tiny hamlet of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, on April 4, 1913, but from the age of three, when his mother died, was raised by his maternal grandmother in Clarksdale, a small town one hundred miles to the north.\n\nIt is scarcely surprising then that the Delta region has nurtured a tradition of blues singing and playing that reflects the harsh, brutal life there, a music shot through with all the agonized tension, bitterness, stark power and raw passion of life lived at or near the brink of despair. Poised between life and death, the Delta bluesman gave vent to his terror, frustration, rage and passionate humanity in a music that was taut with dark, brooding force and spellbinding intensity that was jagged, harsh, raw as an open wound and profoundly, inexorably, moving. The great Delta blues musicians-Charley Patton, Son House, Tommy Johnson and, especially in Waters' case, the brilliant, tortured Robert Johnson-sang with a naked force, majesty and total conviction that make their music timeless and universal in its power to touch and move us deeply.\n\nGrowing to manhood there, in the very heart of the region that had spawned this magnificent music, Waters was drawn early to its stark, telling, expressive power. He had been working as a farm laborer for several years when at thirteen he took up the harmonica, the instrument on which many blues performers first master the music's rudiments. Four years later he made the switch to guitar. \"You see, I was digging Son House and Robert Johnson.\" The two were the undisputed masters of the region's characteristic \"bottleneck\" style of guitar accompaniment. With this technique the Delta bluesman could utilize the guitar as a perfect extension of his voice, the sliding bottleneck matching the dips, slurs, sliding notes and all the tonal ambiguity of the voice as it is used in singing the blues.\n\nA Within a year, Waters recalled, he had mastered the bottleneck style and the jagged, pulsating rhythms of Delta guitar. He had learned to sing powerfully and expressively in the tightly constricted, pain-filled manner that characterized the best Delta singers. By the time a team of Library of Congress field collectors headed by Alan Lomax visited and recorded Waters for the Library's folksong archives in 1941 (they were looking for Robert Johnson at the time, unaware of his death three years earlier), returning to record him further the following year, he had had several years' local performing experience behind him.\n\nProviding the musical impetus for dancers at rough-and-tumble back country dances, in juke joints, and at picnics, houseparties and other rural entertainments had sharpened the young bluesman's vocal and instrumental abilities to a keen edge. The recordings show the strikingly distinctive power of the young Waters, both as singer and master of Delta bottleneck guitar.\n\nThe following year Muddy put the Delta behind him forever. He moved to Chicago in 1943, and never looked back. But it was not as easy in the Windy City as the young bluesman had imagined. It was the middle of the war and, though times were flush and there was a great deal of money to be earned in the defense industries, the winds of change were blowing uncertainly through the music world.\n\nSpearheading the new blues was Waters. He had persevered with his music. After several years of playing to slowly increasing audiences, first at houseparties and later in small taverns dotted throughout Chicago's huge, sprawling South and West Side black-belt slums, he had begun to record. Ironically enough, it was for Columbia Records that he had made his first recordings as a Chicago bluesman. Unfortunately, the recordings were not issued. Working as a truck driver, Waters had managed to persuade the operators of Aristocrat-later Chess-Records, a small, independent Chicago firm, to record him.\n\nAfter several exploratory recordings made in the company of pianist Sunnyland Slim and bassist Ernest \"Big\" Crawford which made absolutely no impression on the record-buying public, Waters suddenly scored with the single \"I Can't Be Satisfied/I Feel Like Going Home.\" And it is with this record that the history of the modern Chicago blues properly begins. Over the next few years, Waters gathered around him a group of like-minded, country-reared musicians with whom he proceeded to make blues history.\n\nOver the surging rhythmic momentum his group developed so effortlessly, Waters' dark-hued voice chanted the Mississippi blues of his boyhood. In his singing could be heard echoes of the great Delta singers he so admired. Robert Johnson's music, especially, is at the root of so many of Waters' early commercial recordings. But even if the source of the music is not specifically Johnson, it is ultimately based in the traditional blues of his native Mississippi Delta, always the linchpin of Waters' approach to music, as attested by \"Rollin' Stone\" and \"Still A Fool\" (both remarkable reworkings of the Delta standard \"Catfish Blues\"), \"Standing Around Crying,\" \"Rollin' And Tumblin',\" \"Honey Bee,\" among many others.\n\nMuddy WatersFollowing his earliest recordings, made primarily of traditional Mississippi blues staples and his adaptations of them, Muddy slowly broadened the traditional base of his music to incorporate new instrumental sounds and textures. Memorable among these early efforts were the remarkable trio recordings with Little Walter on harmonica and Crawford on bass in support of his incisive amplified bottleneck guitar: \"Louisiana Blues,\" and \"Long Distance Call,\" dating from 1950 or early '51 are justly praised masterpieces of the postwar blues. Waters' regular second guitarist during this period was the empathetic, almost telepathic Jimmy Rogers whose deft, rhythmically unerring playing was unparalleled in the modern blues. A member of Waters' working band from the late 1940s, he was not to make his appearance on a Waters record until the end of 1951, the same time pianist Otis Spann was added to the group's lineup for live performances. With him on board, the modern blues band format and sound was fully settled, documented on such Waters band performances as \"I Just Want To Make Love To You,\" \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"I'm Ready\" (1954), \"Just To Be With You\" (1956) and a host of others.\n\nWith the ensemble finally settled, the final element was added in the form of Willie Dixon the veteran bassist whose abilities as a songwriter of proven talent, versatility and audience-pleasing cleverness enabled Waters to achieve even wider success through the many songs he wrote specifically for, and in some cases helped produce for the singer-guitarist and his crack ensemble. From the middle 1950s Waters' songwriting became almost wholly urban in character, as for example \"She's Nineteen Years Old,\" \"Walkin' Thru The Park,\" \"You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had\" and the anthemic \"Got My Mojo Working,\" among others.\n\nAll through the 1950s Waters solidified and extended his initial success with a series of recordings, many of them absolutely brilliant and none less than satisfying, that firmly established his approach as the dominant postwar blues style. Countless groups emulated its brusque, rude force and thrilling sonorities though few were able to match the peerless ensemble integration it attained so consistently and effortlessly. Members of Waters' various bands-guitarists Jimmy Rogers, Sammy Lawhorn and Luther Johnson, harmonica players Little Walter, Junior Wells and James Cotton, pianists Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins-left to strike out with bands of their own, spreading the Waters gospel further. Later generations of bluesmen took Waters' approach as their birthright: Buddy Guy, Magic Sam, Otis Rush and scores of others-have all been in Waters' debt.\n\nFour decades and more later, the blues of postwar Chicago remain the standard bearers, the yardstick by which all others have been and continue to be measured. Waters, his cohorts and immediate followers had limned definitively the contours of the style, and it was they who extended and reworked the idiom, bringing it to its highest levels. The stage was set for the music's next development, rock-and-roll and its offshoots and permutations.\n\nAs the 1950s gave way to the '60s, blues of the direct, yeasty sort Waters and his bandsmen performed so tellingly became ever less relevant to black listeners who increasingly involved themselves with soul music and its offshoots, the more urbane blues styles of B.B. King and his disciples, and various forms of modern black dance music.\n\nBy this time, however, Waters and other blues performers of his generation had been discovered and taken up by a new audience-young, white and middle-class that had been born of the folk music revival of the late 1950s and swelled even further a few years later by the British blues boom. The bars, taverns and dancehalls of the chitlin' circuit in which he had performed for black dancers and listeners in the previous decade soon had given way to college auditoriums, folksong, blues and jazz clubs and festival stages, both here and abroad, increasing international touring, television appearances and wide acceptance by the rock community, which accorded him the respectful adulation given a founding figure. His young white listeners gained the beauty and majesty of his music.\n\nThrough all this his mentors at Chess Records sought to keep pace with the changing tides in popular music, in response to which they placed Waters in a number of recording contexts they felt would broaden his acceptance even further. The most sensitive and, happily, one of the best received of these productions was the 2-LP set \"Fathers And Sons,\" which paid homage to Waters and his achievements through the sponsorship and participation of several young musicians who had learned directly from him, repaying the favor by using their celebrity to focus attention on him-the brilliant young harmonica player Paul Butterfield and guitarist Michael Bloomfield. In 1977, his long association with Chess at an end, he signed with Blue Sky Records, a label operated by another of his young proteges, the guitarist and singer Johnny Winter, and over the next several years produced four spirited albums under Winter's sympathetic guidance.\n\nMuddy Waters Gettin' DownWaters performed almost uninterruptedly, invariably giving of his best and often, when circumstances conspired to allow it, setting the night on fire with the strength, passion and conviction that only he could muster. He carried his message to countless listeners, first in Chicago, then all the rest of the U.S. and finally, the world. When he died quietly in his sleep on April 30, 1983, in his home in suburban Westmont Illinois, America lost one of the greatest, most influential and enduringly important musicians of the century, one who had reshaped the course of the blues, set it on a new path and, through the influence he exerted on so many other who followed in his trailblazing wake, completely altered the sound, substance and very character of all modern popular music.\n\n-Pete Welding, excerpted from \"Gone to Mainstreet,\" Bluesland, E.P. Dutton, 1992",
      "biography_es": "Cualquiera que haya seguido el curso de la música popular moderna es consciente de la gran influencia ejercida en su desarrollo por un gran número de artistas de blues que colectivamente dieron forma y definieron el enfoque de la música amplificada a fines de la década de 1940 y principios de la de 1950. Chicago fue el punto central para el desarrollo y la difusión del blues moderno y prácticamente todo lo demás ha fluido, de una forma u otra, de esta rica fuente.\n\nLa revolución comenzó de manera bastante desfavorable en 1948 con el lanzamiento de un sencillo de 78 rpm de un cantante y guitarrista llamado Muddy Waters. Junto con Aristocrat 1305 había un par de piezas tradicionales del estilo del delta del Misisipi \"I Cant Be Satisfied\" y \"I Feel Like Going Home\", y en ellas el canto oscuro y majestuoso de Waters. El uso de la amplificación por parte de Waters le dio a su forma de tocar la guitarra una sonoridad y una sonoridad nuevas, poderosas y sorprendentes que introdujeron en la música tradicional un sonido que sus oyentes encontraban muy emocionante, cómodamente familiar pero extrañamente convincente y, sobre todo, inmensamente poderoso, urgente.\n\nDesde el principio fue él quien dominó la música, quien abrió el camino -en estilo, sonido, repertorio, instrumentación, en todos los sentidos- primero como un intérprete de club muy popular desde mediados de la década de 1940 en adelante y, unos años más tarde, como el artista discográfico más influyente en el nuevo idioma del blues amplificado. En los años 1948-55, presentó para definir los enfoques y usos fundamentales del blues moderno en una notable serie de discos innovadores y, como lo ha demostrado el tiempo, clásicos. En los años transcurridos desde entonces, el estilo delineado por Waters se ha ampliado, fragmentado, elaborado y comercializado de otra manera, pero el sonido fundamental terrenal, vital y poderoso del blues de la posguerra, tal como lo definen Muddy y sus miembros de la banda, aún no se ha superado, o incluso igualado. ven a eso No es casualidad que los Rolling Stones eligieran su nombre de una de las mejores primeras grabaciones de Waters; la elección fue meramente profética, ya que Muddy y su magnífica música de base continúan resonando tan emocionante y poderosamente a través de la música de hoy como lo hicieron a finales de ' 40 y principios de los 50 cuando los escuchamos por primera vez.\n\nNació McKinley Morganfield -Muddy Waters es un apodo que le pusieron en la infancia- en la diminuta aldea de Rolling Fork, Mississippi, el 4 de abril de 1913, pero desde los tres años, cuando murió su madre, fue criado por su abuela materna. en Clarksdale, un pequeño pueblo cien millas al norte.",
      "biography_fr": "McKinley Morganfield (né à Rolling Fork, Mississippi le 4 avril 1913 - mort à Westmont, Illinois le 30 avril 1983), plus connu sous le nom de Muddy Waters, est un musicien américain de blues. Il est l'une des figures historiques du Chicago Blues.\n\nMuddy Waters enregistre pour la première fois dans une plantation du Delta du Mississippi, avec Alan Lomax, pour la Bibliothèque du Congrès, en 1940. Il part plus tard pour Chicago, où il change sa guitare acoustique pour une électrique, ajoutant une section rythmique et un harmonica pour former les Chicago Blues. Son groupe joue dans la banlieue ouest de Chicago, avant de rejoindre Chess Records. Ses débuts en tant que bluesman à Chicago ne sont pas évidents, il doit s'y reprendre à trois reprises devant Leonard Chess, patron de Chess Records, avant de signer enfin un contrat pour ses disques. En 1954, il s'installe avec sa famille au 4339 S. Lake Park Avenue où il accueille volontiers d'autres musiciens, comme Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry pour des répétitions ou des jam sessions. Le pianiste Otis Spann et l'harmoniciste Paul Oscher, qui font partie du groupe de Muddy Waters, vivent quelque temps dans le sous-sol de la maison. En 1974, Muddy Waters quitte cette maison et s'installe à Westmont.\nSon influence est énorme sur de nombreux genres musicaux : blues, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, jazz, et country. Waters aidera Chuck Berry à obtenir son premier contrat d'enregistrement.\nSes concerts en Angleterre au début des années 1960, font entendre pour la première fois un groupe de Chicago Blues. Les Rolling Stones décidèrent de s'appeler ainsi à cause de la chanson de Waters Rollin Stone, aussi connue sous le nom de Catfish Blues. Un des grands succès de Led Zeppelin, Whole Lotta Love, était basé sur une chanson de Muddy Waters You Need Love, écrite par Willie Dixon. Ce dernier écrira d'ailleurs plusieurs des chansons les plus connues de Muddy, comme I Just Want to Make Love to You, Hoochie Coochie Man, et I'm Ready.\nSouvent opposé lors de sa carrière à Howlin' Wolf, autre artiste de Chess Records qui fut l'un de ses meilleurs rivaux, il comptera dans son groupe de nombreux harmonicistes de renom notamment Little Walter qui partira faire une carrière solo et James Cotton.\nOn peut aussi citer des chansons ayant contribué au succès de Muddy Waters telles que Long Distance Call, Mannish Boy, et le blues-rock I've Got My Mojo Working et bien sûr, Rollin' Stone.\nMuddy Waters est mort à l'âge de 70 ans et est enterré au cimetière de Restvale, à Alsip dans l'Illinois, en banlieue de Chicago. Son fils \"Big Bill\" Morganfield est également guitariste ; on a pu le voir jouer pour Tom Waits le soir du 9 juillet 2012 à New York, lors de l'émission de David Letterman.",
