  "biography": "Some super groups can almost be compared to an all-star game: a gathering of celebs not used to playing together though they welcome the event as a pleasant diversion from their respective routines, knowing full well no one takes them too seriously. This isn't exactly the case with the members of KINO, namely ARENA guitarist John Mitchell, MARILLION bassist Pete Trawavas, IT BITES keyboard player John Beck and PORCUPINE TREE drummer Chris Maitland. Indeed, they admit to fully intending to continue recording together as a group; an encouraging prospect if we are to believe their first album entitled \"Picture\".\n\nThe listener, however, shouldn't expect a progressive masterpiece or anything resembling, say, TRANSATLANTIC. To put it simply, \"Picture\" is a fine neo-prog album with a couple of progressive tracks on it. Full of catchy elements, the material is rather heavy but highly melodic with a strong pop vein, as most tracks conform to a verse/chorus structure. Ten short pieces (except the 9-minute opener) reward the listener with skilful guitar play, a steaming rhythm section, some quieter moments deftly handled by Beck's keyboards (whose input is probably what justifies the 'prog' moniker here) and decent vocals by ARENA's John Mitchell. A relatively unadventurous but altogether polished, well produced and entertaining CD to be enjoyed for what it is.\n\nHard-edged neo-prog buffs, particularly ARENA and Hogarth-era MARILLION fans are the ones most likely to appreciate this band.",
