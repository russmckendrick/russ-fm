      "biography": "Rage Against the Machine were an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consisted of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello, and drummer Brad Wilk. Their songs express revolutionary left-wing political views. As of 2010, they had sold over 16 million records worldwide. In 2023, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nRage Against the Machine released its eponymous debut album in 1992 to commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. Their second album, Evil Empire, was released in 1996. Their third, The Battle of Los Angeles, followed in 1999, and in 2003, it was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.\n\nIn 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album Renegades and disbanded because of growing creative differences. Members formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, the former frontman of Soundgarden. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. In 2016, Morello, Commerford and Wilk formed a new band, Prophets of Rage, with B-Real, Chuck D, and DJ Lord. Rage Against the Machine were nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2017 and 2018, although both bids failed. The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the second half of the 1990s. In 2003, their self-titled album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAt the start of 2024, Wilk confirmed that the group had permanently broken up. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Rage Against the Machine is the debut album by rock band Rage Against the Machine, released November 3, 1992. The songs on Rage Against the Machine tend to feature political mantras with the vocals rapped. The album peaked at #1 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, and at #45 on the Billboard Top 200 chart.\nTom Morello's guitar soloing is somewhat traditional on this album, taking influence more from heavy metal music, in comparison to later releases where it is more experimental and geared toward emulation of DJs and hip hop.\n\nIn 2001 Q magazine named Rage Against the Machine as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. The album is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album is known for its high production values, which are almost to the strictest audiophile standards. Some audiophile sites and magazines even go as far as using the album — in particular the song \"Take the Power Back\" — to test amplifiers and speakers.\n\nAcclaimed BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe named Rage Against the Machine as one of four albums to be added to his list of 'Masterpieces', and his personal favourite album, on December 2nd, 2008.\n\nThe cover artwork features a famous photo of Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, burning himself to death in Saigon in 1963. The monk was protesting President Ngô Đình Diệm's administration for oppressing the Buddhist religion. The photograph drew international attention and persuaded U.S. President John F. Kennedy to withdraw support of the Ngô Đình Diệm's government. It was taken by Associated Press correspondent Malcolm Browne; a similar photograph earned the award of World Press Photo of the Year in 1963.\n\nActivists such as Provisional IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands and Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton are listed in the \"Thanks For Inspiration\" section. Also thanked were Ian and Alec MacKaye – de la Rocha was straight edge at the time, though he later took up smoking.\n\nThe lyrics for each song were printed in the album booklet with the exception of those for \"Killing in the Name\", which were omitted; the booklet reads \"2. KILLING IN THE NAME\", skips the lyrics and continues with the next song.\n\nThe statement \"no samples, keyboards or synthesizers used in the making of this record\" can be found at the end of the sleeve notes, and similar statements were made in the band's subsequent albums. The band also refer to themselves as \"Guilty Parties\" for each album.\n\n\"Wake Up\" is featured in the credits of The Matrix and in the video game Dave Mirra's Freestyle BMX 2, while \"Killing in the Name\" is featured in the video games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Guitar Hero II. Edits of \"Bombtrack\" and \"Take the Power Back\" are featured in the Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rage+Against+the+Machine/Rage+Against+the+Machine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
