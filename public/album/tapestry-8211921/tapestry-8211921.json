      "biography": "Carole King (born February 9, 1942) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist, regarded as one of the most influential female songwriters of the 20th century. One half of a legendary songwriting partnership together with her one-time husband, Gerry Goffin, she wrote several hit songs in the ‘60s hits for artists such as The Shirelles (“Will You Love Me Tomorrow”), Aretha Franklin (“(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman”), and The Monkees (“Pleasant Valley Sunday”). At the dawn of the ‘70s, she released the solo album Tapestry, a critically and financially successful landmark in the singer-songwriter genre. \n\n Born Carol Klein in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish household, King started out playing the piano, then moved on to singing, forming a vocal quartet called the Co-Sines at James Madison High School. She attended Queens College, where she was a classmate of Neil Sedaka and inspired Sedaka’s first big hit, “Oh! Carol”, to which she later wrote and recorded a tongue-in-cheek response, “Oh! Neil”. Along with Sedaka and Gerry Goffin (whom she later married), King also befriended Paul Simon at the same college.\n\n Goffin and King soon formed a songwriting partnership, eventually married, and had two daughters, Louise Goffin and Sherry Goffin Kondor, both of whom have also become singers. Working for Aldon Music in the Brill Building in the heart of New York’s music district, where chart-topping hits were churfned out during the 1960s, the Goffin-King partnership first hit it big with “Will You Love Me Tomorrow”. Recorded by The Shirelles, the song topped the charts in 1961. It was later covered by Dusty Springfield, Little Eva, Roberta Flack, Laura Branigan, The Four Seasons, and King herself.",

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> It would all sound trite, if it weren’t so true: In the late 1960s, a seasoned professional New York songsmith moves to Laurel Canyon, finds her voice in a whole new way and emerges with one of the biggest records of the 1970s. That’s the shorthand history behind Carole King’s 1971 hit <i>Tapestry</i>, an iconic entry in the canon of genre-agnostic singer-songwriters, and the album that marked the dawning of King’s second act. Working alongside like-minded West Coast artists James Taylor and Joni Mitchell, the hitmaking singer narrowed her scope, stripping down and getting personal as a songwriter and a performer—and, in doing so, creating a timeless standard for confessional expression. In a decade dominated by monolithic pop albums, <i>Tapestry</i> became one of the biggest, eventually selling more than 14 million copies.\n\nEven before the album’s release, King had helped reshape American pop music as a songwriter, her work often speaking for women as a group: She articulated previously masked vulnerability on The Shirelles’ “Will You Love Me Tomorrow”, and expressed daring, earthy sensuality on Aretha Franklin’s “(You Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman”. But on <i>Tapestry</i>, her second album as a soloist, King reclaims those songs, using them to tell her own story along with a slew of new compositions. Her previous hits had been co-written with her ex-husband, Gerry Goffin, but on <i>Tapestry</i>, King accepted one new songwriting collaborator: Toni Stern, who provided lyrics for “It’s Too Late” and “Where You Lead”. Besides Stern’s sterling contributions, King centered her own words, voice and piano-playing. And throughout <i>Tapestry</i>, her gutting honesty and earnest optimism are channelled with the easy fluency of a veteran pop songwriter.\n\nIndividually, the songs have long since been woven into pop music’s unconscious: “I Feel The Earth Move” became an instant R&B classic; “You’ve Got A Friend” remains a somehow-never-saccharine pledge of loyalty; and “It’s Too Late” is the break-up anthem to end all break-up anthems. Together, they weave a <i>Tapestry</i> about the power of vulnerability, one that King performs with unflinching and carefree power, wrapping everything in an unpretentious and lovely musical package.",
