      "editorial_notes": "Traditionally, a band release their debut album and head out for an extended stretch on the road, honing their live chops, twisting their songs into new shapes. But when Black Country, New Road released <i>For the First Time</i> in February 2021, that route was blocked off by the pandemic. Instead, the London-based band set out to tweak and tamper with their experimental post-rock sound for a transformative second album. They might not have been able to travel, but their music could. “By the time the first album came out, those songs had existed for so long that we were very keen to change the way we wrote music,” bassist Tyler Hyde tells Apple Music. The material that makes up their second record, <i>Ants From Up There</i>, soon came to life, the group using the labyrinthine “Basketball Shoes”, which had been around before their debut, as a springboard. “We wanted to explore the themes we’d created on that song,” says Hyde. “It’s essentially three songs within one, all of which relatively cover the emotions and moods that are on the album. It’s hopeful and light, but still looks at some of the darker sides that the first album showed.”<br />\nThe resultant record sees the band hit hypnotic new peaks. <i>Ants From Up There</i>, recorded before the departure of singer Isaac Wood in January 2022, is less reliant on jerky, rhythmic U-turns than their debut (although there is some of that), with expansive, Godspeed You! Black Emperor-ish atmospherics emerging in their place. “Fundamentally, we relearned an entirely new style of playing with each other,” says drummer Charlie Wayne. “We learned a lot about how to express ourselves just for each other rather than for anything else going on externally.” Here Hyde, Wayne and saxophonist Lewis Evans take us through it, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Intro”</b>\nLewis Evans: “This uses the theme from ’Basketball Shoes’, compressed into these little micro cells and repeated over and over again. It’s just a straight-up, impactful welcome to the album.”<br />\n<b>“Chaos Space Marine”</b>\nTyler Hyde: “In this song, we allowed ourselves to get out all the stupid, funny joke style of playing. It was just our way of saying yes to everything. There are many things across the album—and in previous songs from the last album—that are seemingly good ideas, but they’ve come about through a joke. I think the rest of the album is much more considered than that. It’s our silly song. It’s a voyage. It’s a sea shanty. It’s a space trip.”<br />\n<b>“Concorde”</b>\nCharlie Wayne: “I love how it follows the same chord progression the whole way through, and it’s driven but very soft. It’s got real moments of delicacy, and it’s a song that we all thought quite a lot about when we were getting it together. When you’re restricted to that one-chord sequence, you want it to feel as though it’s going somewhere and progressing, so the peaks and troughs have to be considered.”<br />\n<b>“Bread Song”</b>\nLE: “It’s like two different songs in one. You’ve got this really quite flowing and free track in a melodic and conventional harmonic way, but rhythmically free and flowing accompaniment to Isaac’s vocals. It feels quite orchestral, and the way that we all play together on this recording is so in sync with each other. We were listening to each other so much, so the swells that one person starts making, people start responding to, and everybody is swelling at the same time and getting quieter at the same time. Then it turns into this almost Soweto, kind of township-style pop tune at the end. It’s a really fun ending to an intense, emotional tune.”<br />\n<b>“Good Will Hunting”</b>\nLE: “This is another slightly silly one, and it’s got a really silly ending which actually never made the cut on the album, but it’s heavily driven by the riff on the guitars. I think at the time we were listening to quite a bit of Kurt Vile, especially rhythmically. I can remember a conversation about when we wanted the drums to come in and to be super straight, super driven. Then for the choruses, rhythmically, to completely flip and not feel like they were big at all. So for both the choruses, the drums are just tiny.”<br />\n<b>“Haldern”</b>\nTH: “We were playing at Haldern Pop Festival in north Germany during lockdown. We’d just been allowed to fly for work purposes, and we were doing this session. We did two performances there, and the second one was a livestream, and we weren’t allowed to play songs that weren’t released. At the time, that left us with not very much that we weren’t already bored with, so we decided to do some improv. It was a very lucky day where we were all very in sync with one another. So ‘Haldern’ was totally from improv, which is not how we write ever.”<br />\n<b>“Mark’s Theme”</b>\nLE: “This is a tune written kind of for my uncle who passed away from COVID in 2021. I wrote it on my tenor saxophone as soon as I found out. I just started playing and wrote that. It’s a reflection on him and my feelings towards him passing away and everything being really bleak. He was a massive fan and supporter of the band, so it felt right to put that on the album and to have his name remembered with our music.”<br />\n<b>“The Place Where He Inserted the Blade”</b>\nCW: “For me, this is about as far away as we went from the first album. Aesthetically, where the first album has moments of real dissonance and apathy, ‘The Place Where He Inserted the Blade’ is very warm and rich and quite uplifting. I think it strikes right to the heart of what the album is for me, which is fundamentally being in the room, making music with my friends.”<br />\n<b>“Snow Globes”</b>\nLE: “This is another tune where we really thought about what we wanted from it before we wrote it. We had examples of things we liked, and one of them was Frank Ocean’s ‘White Ferrari’. We liked the idea of it almost being like two different bands [playing] at the same time. So you’ve got this quite simple but quite heart-wrenching, fugal-sounding arrangement of all the instruments with a drum solo that is just crazy and doesn’t really relate too much to what is going on in the other instruments. We react to the drum solo, but he doesn’t react to us. It’s that kind of idea.”<br />\n<b>“Basketball Shoes”</b>\nTH: “It’s essentially a medley of the whole album. It’s got literal musical motifs that are repeated on different songs in the album. It touches on all the themes that we’ve been exploring, and it’s the most climactic song on the album. It wouldn’t really make sense to not finish with it, it’s so exhausting. It’s such a journey. I think you just wouldn’t be able to pay much attention to anything that followed it because you’d be so wiped out after listening to it.”",

The material that makes up their second record, <i>Ants From Up There</i>, soon came to life, the group using the labyrinthine “Basketball Shoes”, which had been around before their debut, as a springboard. “We wanted to explore the themes we’d created on that song,” says Hyde. “It’s essentially three songs within one, all of which relatively cover the emotions and moods that are on the album. It’s hopeful and light, but still looks at some of the darker sides that the first album showed.”<br />\nThe resultant record sees the band hit hypnotic new peaks. <i>Ants From Up There</i>, recorded before the departure of singer Isaac Wood in January 2022, is less reliant on jerky, rhythmic U-turns than their debut (although there is some of that), with expansive, Godspeed You! Black Emperor-ish atmospherics emerging in their place. “Fundamentally, we relearned an entirely new style of playing with each other,” says drummer Charlie Wayne. “We learned a lot about how to express ourselves just for each other rather than for anything else going on externally.” Here Hyde, Wayne and saxophonist Lewis Evans take us through it, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Intro”</b>\nLewis Evans: “This uses the theme from ’Basketball Shoes’, compressed into these little micro cells and repeated over and over again. It’s just a straight-up, impactful welcome to the album.”<br />\n<b>“Chaos Space Marine”</b>\nTyler Hyde: “In this song, we allowed ourselves to get out all the stupid, funny joke style of playing. It was just our way of saying yes to everything. There are many things across the album—and in previous songs from the last album—that are seemingly good ideas, but they’ve come about through a joke. I think the rest of the album is much more considered than that. It’s our silly song. It’s a voyage. It’s a sea shanty. It’s a space trip.”<br />\n<b>“Concorde”</b>\nCharlie Wayne: “I love how it follows the same chord progression the whole way through, and it’s driven but very soft. It’s got real moments of delicacy, and it’s a song that we all thought quite a lot about when we were getting it together. When you’re restricted to that one-chord sequence, you want it to feel as though it’s going somewhere and progressing, so the peaks and troughs have to be considered.”<br />\n<b>“Bread Song”</b>\nLE: “It’s like two different songs in one. You’ve got this really quite flowing and free track in a melodic and conventional harmonic way, but rhythmically free and flowing accompaniment to Isaac’s vocals. It feels quite orchestral, and the way that we all play together on this recording is so in sync with each other. We were listening to each other so much, so the swells that one person starts making, people start responding to, and everybody is swelling at the same time and getting quieter at the same time. Then it turns into this almost Soweto, kind of township-style pop tune at the end. It’s a really fun ending to an intense, emotional tune.”<br />\n<b>“Good Will Hunting”</b>\nLE: “This is another slightly silly one, and it’s got a really silly ending which actually never made the cut on the album, but it’s heavily driven by the riff on the guitars. I think at the time we were listening to quite a bit of Kurt Vile, especially rhythmically. I can remember a conversation about when we wanted the drums to come in and to be super straight, super driven. Then for the choruses, rhythmically, to completely flip and not feel like they were big at all. So for both the choruses, the drums are just tiny.”<br />\n<b>“Haldern”</b>\nTH: “We were playing at Haldern Pop Festival in north Germany during lockdown. We’d just been allowed to fly for work purposes, and we were doing this session. We did two performances there, and the second one was a livestream, and we weren’t allowed to play songs that weren’t released. At the time, that left us with not very much that we weren’t already bored with, so we decided to do some improv. It was a very lucky day where we were all very in sync with one another. So ‘Haldern’ was totally from improv, which is not how we write ever.”<br />\n<b>“Mark’s Theme”</b>\nLE: “This is a tune written kind of for my uncle who passed away from COVID in 2021. I wrote it on my tenor saxophone as soon as I found out. I just started playing and wrote that. It’s a reflection on him and my feelings towards him passing away and everything being really bleak. He was a massive fan and supporter of the band, so it felt right to put that on the album and to have his name remembered with our music.”<br />\n<b>“The Place Where He Inserted the Blade”</b>\nCW: “For me, this is about as far away as we went from the first album. Aesthetically, where the first album has moments of real dissonance and apathy, ‘The Place Where He Inserted the Blade’ is very warm and rich and quite uplifting. I think it strikes right to the heart of what the album is for me, which is fundamentally being in the room, making music with my friends.”<br />\n<b>“Snow Globes”</b>\nLE: “This is another tune where we really thought about what we wanted from it before we wrote it. We had examples of things we liked, and one of them was Frank Ocean’s ‘White Ferrari’. We liked the idea of it almost being like two different bands [playing] at the same time. So you’ve got this quite simple but quite heart-wrenching, fugal-sounding arrangement of all the instruments with a drum solo that is just crazy and doesn’t really relate too much to what is going on in the other instruments. We react to the drum solo, but he doesn’t react to us. It’s that kind of idea.”<br />\n<b>“Basketball Shoes”</b>\nTH: “It’s essentially a medley of the whole album. It’s got literal musical motifs that are repeated on different songs in the album. It touches on all the themes that we’ve been exploring, and it’s the most climactic song on the album. It wouldn’t really make sense to not finish with it, it’s so exhausting. It’s such a journey. I think you just wouldn’t be able to pay much attention to anything that followed it because you’d be so wiped out after listening to it.”"

            "content": "Ants From Up There is the second studio album by British rock band Black Country, New Road, released on 4 February 2022 on Ninja Tune. Recorded at Chale Abbey on the Isle of Wight, the album was produced by the band's live sound engineer Sergio Maschetzko, and is the final album to feature lead vocalist and guitarist Isaac Wood, who announced his departure from the band on 31 January 2022, four days prior to the album's release.\n\nWritten during COVID-19 lockdowns and road-tested during brief touring stints in support of their debut album \"For the first time\", the album was released almost exactly a year after their debut, and was preceded by four singles: \"Chaos Space Marine\", \"Bread Song\", \"Concorde\" and \"Snow Globes\". The album received unanimous critical acclaim upon its release. It became Black Country, New Road's highest-charting album, debuting at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n“We were really, really hyped making this record,” says Lewis Evans of Black Country, New Road. “We all love every single moment of this album.” \n\nMost bands, having been at the centre of a whirlwind of hype and critical acclaim, would be happy to stick to a winning formula for repeat success but creative stagnation is of zero interest to BC,NR who have swiftly returned with a follow album that takes yet another bold and innovative musical leap. \n\nTheir debut, For the first time, is a 2021 Album of the Year, receiving ecstatic reviews and picking up a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize, and the band have harnessed the momentum from that record and run full pelt into their second. On their debut album, the band (Evans, May Kershaw, Charlie Wayne, Luke Mark, Isaac Wood, Tyler Hyde and Georgia Ellery) melded klezmer, post-rock, indie and an often intense spoken word delivery. On Ants From Up There they have expanded on this unique concoction to create a singular sonic middle ground that traverses classical minimalism, indie-folk, pop, alt-rock and a distinct tone that is already unique to the band.\n\nGiven the incredible acclaim for the band’s debut, some second album jitters would be forgiven or perhaps expected, but that’s not the case here, such is the laser focus on forward momentum. “I understand how that may be for some bands,” says Evans. “You get all of this buzz around you and if you still haven't come up with your new sound, you can really start to pander to what you think people want and that’s not always good. I think if we did that people would want a record that sounded even more like Slint.” \n\nTracks such as “Chaos Space Marine” combine sprightly violin, rhythmic piano, and stabs of saxophone to create something infectiously fluid that bubbles to a rounding crescendo. It’s a track that Wood calls “the best song we’ve ever written.” It’s a chaotic yet coherent creation that ricochets around unpredictably but also seamlessly. “We threw in every idea anyone had with that song,” says Wood. “So the making of it was a really fast, whimsical and silly approach - like throwing all the shit at the wall and just letting everything stick.”\n\nThrowing every idea the band has into something is symbolic of an album bursting with ideas and zealous creativity. “Bread Song” might be rooted in something hugely relatable and every day - bread crumbs in bed - but the lyrics were tweaked and thought about in various stages over a four-year period. And musically - a song that is tender and stripped back but swells up in beautiful moments that engulf the listener like crashing waves - it contains equal depth. “We wanted to do the first chorus with no time signature,” says Wood. “I went to see Steve Reich do Music for 18 Musicians and there's a piece where a bar length is determined by the breadth of the clarinet player, they just play until they run out of breath. I wanted to try that with the whole band, where we don't look at each other, we don't make too many cues, we just try and play without time - but together.” \n\n“Haldern” is an attempt to record the spirit and intuition of spontaneous improvisation. It stems from a live stream performance at Haldern Pop Festival in Germany. “Every now and then in the middle of a gig, we'll do some improvisation because it can be really fun,” says Wood. “When we did it this time we basically wrote a whole song, which is the first time we've ever done that.” It’s another song from the album that aims to capture the magic of the moment, a one-off musical creation that can never be entirely replicated again. Whereas the gently stirring “The Place Where He Inserted the Blade” pays homage to late-period Bob Dylan. “I started writing this in response to, or heavily inspired by, “I've Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You”,” says Wood of the 2020 Dylan track. “The whole weird bluesy loungy thing where all the instruments blend into one another really appealed to me.”  \n\n“Concorde” swings from one of the most tender moments on the album-opening with tip-tap drums, twisting guitar lines and Wood’s almost whisper-soft delivery - into one of its most joyous and eruptive. It captures the band exploring a vast range of dynamics as they harness the power of tension and release, exercising potency in not only the explosive crescendo but also the restrained build-up. Named after the film but lyrically removed from it, “Good Will Hunting”, is driven by unshakably infectious melodies that snake throughout the song. Stabs of drums build things up in punchy bursts as the melody weaves in and out before a final burst of crunchy guitar fires it home with some of Wood’s most intense vocal work on the album. Much like the lyrics to the chorus, consisting of a bunch of made-up quotes aimed to mirror multiple people conversing at once, the result is something that feels fluid yet unpredictable.\n\nThe powerful closing one-two of “Snow Globes” and “Basketball Shoes” sees the band shift between delicacy and enormity, finding them at their most potent and arresting, as well as joyous and triumphant. This sense of ecstatic joy, exuberance and euphoria the band are tapping into can be heard throughout, and is also reflected in Wood’s move away from the spoken word into a singing voice that carefully swings between quiet restraint and stirring zest. “Basketball Shoes” - a fan favourite and a staple of the live set for some time - was the scattered seed that soon flowered into an album. “It's the whole basis and blueprint for the album,” says Wood.  \n\nTo make this bold, expressive and expansive follow-up the band retreated to the Isle of Wight for a three-week stay. The recording was done with producer Sergio Maschetzko, who is also the head sound engineer at the London venue the Lexington, along with engineer David Granshaw. “They were both completely fundamental to how it ended up sounding,” says Wood, with Evans adding: “We’re quite a difficult band to record because we have very high standards and expectations of our own playing. We have a very particular sound in our head of what we want to sound like so it's really difficult for us to decide when the take is the take. It was really helpful to have Serge there as a witness to it all - I think if we didn't have him in there we'd probably have the most perfect takes but that was lacking energy.” \n\nA sense of universal celebration is clearly taking place within the band and this feeling is also mirrored in the intention of the album - to be something of a unifier. “We are slowly trying to make our music really accessible,” says Evans. “You don't need to make weird-sounding music to make weird music. There's not much in alternative music that is digestible and accessible while still being quite strange. Whereas you get a lot of that in pop music, a lot of artists make really weird music when you pick it apart but it still just sounds like perfect pop. We really liked the idea of doing that.”\n\nMaking music that is more accessible while retaining an innovative approach is something that has come from an enhanced sense of ease in the band. “The first time you do the album thing you're very wary,” says Wood. “We didn't get whisked up in it all by getting super excited, we kind of did the opposite: we were very careful and cautious. Learning from that experience, those things that you're really stressed about don't really matter too much. It's more of a comfort now, there's less tension because each specific decision means, in a way, less to us. We're less picky about shit. That's allowed us to be more comfortable and to just make music.” \n\nThe result is an album that is cohesive and very much a full body of work. “One of the first decisions we made about the album was that it was going to have a bit more of a musical through-line,” says Evans. “Something that makes it feel like more of an album.” A repeating musical motif that bookends the album from “Intro” to the closing “Basketball Shoes” plays a key role in creating the glue that holds the record together. “It’s the main basis to “Basketball Shoes” and that was written before the rest of the album,” offers Evans. “We thought it was a great theme and we really like it when that happens in music. There's a Shostakovich piece where there's a theme that occurs over a lot of the different movements and another very different example is “What's Going On” by Marvin Gaye, where you've got that through-line theme and I love that on albums.” \n\nLyrically, however, there’s less of a distinct theme, with Wood piecing together a lot from fragmented bits of writing and keeping hold of a lot of placeholder lyrics. “The themes of the lyrics kind of move with the themes of the music,” he says. “Trying to access something slightly more universal while still being interesting. It's a different time, a different place, a different world and the lyrics probably reflect that. They're quite different from the first record, but there's a pretty consistent through-line.” \n\nMuch like musical motifs appear and reappear, so do snippets of Wood’s lyrics, from digging oneself into a hole, to a character in possession of “Billie Eilish style” to themes of escape, travel and separation via everything from Concorde to Starships. “When you're in a period of songwriting you're quite often trying to write the same song and you end up writing it like six or seven times,” explains Wood. “They then spread out but they do sort of come from the same place. It's like trying to accomplish the same thing over and over again and so the songs end up with themes.” \n\nAnts From Up There manages to strike a skilful balance between feeling like a bold stylistic overhaul of what came before, as well as a natural progression. It’s also an album that comes loaded with a deep-rooted conviction in the end result. “We were just so hyped the whole time\", says Hyde. “It was such a pleasure to make. I've kind of accepted that this might be the best thing that I'm ever part of for the rest of my life. And that's fine.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Country,+New+Road/Ants+From+Up+There\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
