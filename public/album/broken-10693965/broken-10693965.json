      "biography": "Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated as NIN, sometimes stylized as NIИ) is an American industrial rock project, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor (until the 2009 Wave Goodbye Tour) usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows.\n\nUnderground music audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits; two Nine Inch Nails recordings have won Grammy Awards; and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 30 million albums worldwide, with 11 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\" In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently.\n\nSince 1989, Nine Inch Nails has made eight major studio releases. The most recent releases, Ghosts I-IV and The Slip, both released in 2008, were released under Creative Commons licenses (BY-NC-SA). Both were initially released digitally, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of The Slip was made available completely free of charge. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards and won twice for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\", in 1992 and 1995 respectively.",

            "content": "Broken (also known as Halo 5) is an EP released on September 22nd 1992. Although not technically so, Broken is usually considered Nine Inch Nails' second major release after Pretty Hate Machine since it consists entirely of new material. The EP was recorded in secret, in order to avoid interference from TVT Records. It was followed later that year by Fixed, a companion EP of remixes of the songs on Broken.\n\nThe release of Broken followed on from a major disagreement between Trent Reznor and his record label at the time, TVT Records, and the influence of the conflict is evident in multiple aspects of the record. After the credits in the packaging, a line reads \"no thanks: you know who you fucking are\" followed by \"the slave thinks he is released from bondage only to find a stronger set of chains.\" This is most likely directed towards TVT Records' Steve Gottlieb, who refused to allow Reznor out of his contract, resulting in a legal battle between the two parties. A direct reference to Gottlieb appears in one of the music videos for \"Gave Up\", where the words \"FUCK YOU STEVE\" can be spotted on a computer screen.\n\nReznor has also stated that during the Pretty Hate Machine Tour the songs grew more aggressive when played by a live band compared to their studio counterparts. Violence on-stage also became a common feature at their shows as a result of the band venting pent-up frustration and anger on their instruments. Consequently, Broken sounds much more abrasive and harsher with the increased prominence of distorted guitars, amongst other things.\n\nOn this EP, there are louder mixes and more distortion on every instrument, including a classic Mellotron MKIV (originally owned by John Lennon), which can be heard most noticeably on the track \"Gave Up\". Reznor said he wanted the album to be \"an abrasive, hard-to-listen-to thing... I wanted to make a record that the first time you hear it you don't like it, but you might want to hear it again, but by the third time it's pretty cool. By the fifth time, you really like it and possibly by the tenth time you're not sick of it and now it all makes sense.\"\n\nIn an interview with Keyboard Magazine in 1994, Reznor elaborated on the EP's unique guitar textures: \"Broken, for example, had a lot of that super-thick chunk sound. Almost every guitar sound on that record was me playing through an old Zoom pedal, direct, and then going into Turbosynth. Then I used a couple of key ingredients to make it sound unlike any real sound in the world, and layered about four of them together. By then, it wasn't a guitar anymore. It's an awesome sound.\"\n\nIn an interview with Alternative Press in 1993, Reznor discussed the writing and instrumentation: \"I tried doing an album that I actually just wrote on guitar rather than my tried-and-true method of a drum machine and keyboards. So with the exception of \"Happiness in Slavery\" all songs were written on guitar. I was gonna make it totally stripped down to guitar, bass and drums but as I started it I realized I could easily fall into another trap. What might sound interesting to me - because I'm not used to it - may sound like a garage band to the world. So we just took the three instruments and sampled 'em, fucked with 'em, processed them. It's kind of overboard, we did go crazy. It's kind of dense, too dense. It's over analyzed - every song has 20 different melodies that you won't hear the first five or ten times you listen, or maybe never.\"\n\nMusic videos were shot for each song with the exception of \"Last\", \"Physical (You're So)\" and \"Suck.\" These videos were included on the second part of the Closure VHS set. Peter Christopherson also compiled these videos along with an alternate version of \"Gave Up\" into a very violent and extreme long-form video known as the Broken Movie. \n\nOn most CD copies of Broken, tracks 7 through 97 consist of silence and \"Physical\" and \"Suck\" are tracks 98 and 99. The initial pressing of the CD contained \"Physical\" and \"Suck\" on a second 3\" mini CD in a separate sleeve. On certain CD versions, \"Physical\" is track 7 and \"Suck\" is track 8.

      "wiki_content": "Broken (also known as Halo 5) is an EP released on September 22nd 1992. Although not technically so, Broken is usually considered Nine Inch Nails' second major release after Pretty Hate Machine since it consists entirely of new material. The EP was recorded in secret, in order to avoid interference from TVT Records. It was followed later that year by Fixed, a companion EP of remixes of the songs on Broken.\n\nThe release of Broken followed on from a major disagreement between Trent Reznor and his record label at the time, TVT Records, and the influence of the conflict is evident in multiple aspects of the record. After the credits in the packaging, a line reads \"no thanks: you know who you fucking are\" followed by \"the slave thinks he is released from bondage only to find a stronger set of chains.\" This is most likely directed towards TVT Records' Steve Gottlieb, who refused to allow Reznor out of his contract, resulting in a legal battle between the two parties. A direct reference to Gottlieb appears in one of the music videos for \"Gave Up\", where the words \"FUCK YOU STEVE\" can be spotted on a computer screen.\n\nReznor has also stated that during the Pretty Hate Machine Tour the songs grew more aggressive when played by a live band compared to their studio counterparts. Violence on-stage also became a common feature at their shows as a result of the band venting pent-up frustration and anger on their instruments. Consequently, Broken sounds much more abrasive and harsher with the increased prominence of distorted guitars, amongst other things.\n\nOn this EP, there are louder mixes and more distortion on every instrument, including a classic Mellotron MKIV (originally owned by John Lennon), which can be heard most noticeably on the track \"Gave Up\". Reznor said he wanted the album to be \"an abrasive, hard-to-listen-to thing... I wanted to make a record that the first time you hear it you don't like it, but you might want to hear it again, but by the third time it's pretty cool. By the fifth time, you really like it and possibly by the tenth time you're not sick of it and now it all makes sense.\"\n\nIn an interview with Keyboard Magazine in 1994, Reznor elaborated on the EP's unique guitar textures: \"Broken, for example, had a lot of that super-thick chunk sound. Almost every guitar sound on that record was me playing through an old Zoom pedal, direct, and then going into Turbosynth. Then I used a couple of key ingredients to make it sound unlike any real sound in the world, and layered about four of them together. By then, it wasn't a guitar anymore. It's an awesome sound.\"\n\nIn an interview with Alternative Press in 1993, Reznor discussed the writing and instrumentation: \"I tried doing an album that I actually just wrote on guitar rather than my tried-and-true method of a drum machine and keyboards. So with the exception of \"Happiness in Slavery\" all songs were written on guitar. I was gonna make it totally stripped down to guitar, bass and drums but as I started it I realized I could easily fall into another trap. What might sound interesting to me - because I'm not used to it - may sound like a garage band to the world. So we just took the three instruments and sampled 'em, fucked with 'em, processed them. It's kind of overboard, we did go crazy. It's kind of dense, too dense. It's over analyzed - every song has 20 different melodies that you won't hear the first five or ten times you listen, or maybe never.\"\n\nMusic videos were shot for each song with the exception of \"Last\", \"Physical (You're So)\" and \"Suck.\" These videos were included on the second part of the Closure VHS set. Peter Christopherson also compiled these videos along with an alternate version of \"Gave Up\" into a very violent and extreme long-form video known as the Broken Movie. \n\nOn most CD copies of Broken, tracks 7 through 97 consist of silence and \"Physical\" and \"Suck\" are tracks 98 and 99. The initial pressing of the CD contained \"Physical\" and \"Suck\" on a second 3\" mini CD in a separate sleeve. On certain CD versions, \"Physical\" is track 7 and \"Suck\" is track 8. Prior to the 2017 Definitive Edition, there was no commercial vinyl released in the US. There was only a promo that did not include \"Pinion\" and \"Help Me I Am In Hell\". There is also a promo 12\" from the UK with the bonus tracks on side B, and a 12\" from Brazil with \"Gave Up\" and the bonus tracks on side B. The cassette versions typically had all of the main tracks on side A and the bonus tracks on side B, though they were sometimes not listed on the cassette or the insert.\n\n\"The last two tracks were leftovers from a 12\" that should have been released when we did lollapalooza, but due to record labels.... ...so, i thought they were good enough to be released, but did not fit with 'broken', so, i wanted to give them away but keep them separate from the EP, so, i came up with the 3\" CD idea, but, my record label informed me that it cost so much to manufacture that they could not break even EVER regardless of sales, so, i compromised and allowed the first 250,000 to have the 3\" CD, and the rest to have them on tracks 98-99 (so nobody would be ripped off).\nIt was a way to distance them from the other music because it wasn't part of the same mind set.
