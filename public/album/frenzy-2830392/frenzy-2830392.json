      "biography": "Split Enz were one of the most successful and longest running bands ever to emerge from New Zealand. Founded in 1972 by Tim Finn and Phil Judd, and with a variety of other members during its existence, eight songs Split Enz were listed in the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time, more than any other band. The band played its final show on 4 December 1984 in Auckland. One-off reunions took place subsequently, with the band reuniting in 1993 for its twentieth anniversary tour and once more for a tour in 2006.\n\nThe band was formed in Auckland, New Zealand in 1972 by Tim Finn, Phil Judd, Mike Chunn, Miles Golding, and Mike Howard, who originally called themselves \"Split Ends.\" They soon changed the spelling to honor their NZ homeland. For much of their career, the band was known for wild costumes and make-up designed by Crombie. For the first phase of their existence, the band played a kind of progressive rock infused with music-hall humor; later they slipped into a quirky new wave style that generated hits worldwide.\n\nNumerous personnel changes have been a defining factor for the Enz. Notable additions include keyboardist Eddie Rayner and percussionist Noel Crombie in 1974, and in 1977 Tim's brother Neil Finn (who would later form Crowded House). The group effectively disbanded in 1984, but in subsequent years have reunited several times for well-received tours including in 1993 for its twentieth anniversary tour and once more for a tour in 2006.\n\nLast.FM occasionally lists scrobbles belonging to a 60s garage band called The Split Ends (from Tampa, FL) if the listener omits the article \"The\" in their music tags. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Split+Enz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
