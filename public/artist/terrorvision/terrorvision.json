The four piece band of Tony Wright (b. 6 May 1968; vocals), Mark Yates (b. 4 April 1968; guitar), Leigh Marklew (b. 10 August 1968: bass) and Shutty (b. 20 March 1967; drums) made little headway until a change of name to Terrorvision (inspired by a cult 80's horror film) in 1991 when [l=EMI Records] signed them on the back of demo tape \"Pump Action Sunshine.\"  The band negotiated with EMI the creation of their own label \"[l=Total Vegas Recordings]\" and in 1992 their debut EP \"Thrive\" was released by Total Vegas followed by the band's first LP \"Formaldehyde\" later in the year.  1994 saw the release of second album \"How To Make Friends And Influence People\" which generated a string of chart hits for the band including \"Oblivion\" and \"Alice, What's The Matter?\"  With third LP \"Regular Urban Survivors\" (1996) Terrorvision continued on their upward trajectory and single \"Perseverance\" earned the band their first top 5 hit with further chart success for singles \"Celebrity Hit List\" and \"Bad Actress\" though real chart domination was to come in January 1999 with the number 2 smash \"Tequila\" taken from the \"Shaving Peaches (1998) album.  Despite this, EMI chose to drop the band and in early 2000 the band (and Total Vegas Recordings) were rescued by [l=Papillon Records] for whom the band recorded the 2001 album \"Good To Go.\"  The reprieve however was temporary and in June 2001 the band announced their split marked by a farewell tour of the UK and a 'best of' album to satisfy EMI's five album contract entitled \"Whales & Dolphins.\"  In April 2005 the band reformed for a brief UK tour with further dates in August and September, which EMI took as a good excuse to release another compilation \"B-Sides & Rarities\".\r\n\r\nIn 2010 after replacing drummer 'Shutty', they started work on an album which was completed and released in 2011 under the title 'Super Deluxe'.\r\n",

After a undeniably wise name change, the band released their first album \"Formaldehyde\" in 1992. Although showing their obvious Heavy Metal influences, there was a sense of humour and pop leaning which could not be hidden, particularly in their breakthrough single \"My House\". It was those pop quirks which informed their breakthrough second album \"How To Make Friends And Influence People\". A collection of exuberant pop-metal classics, it featured the single \"Oblivion\", which showed off TVs trademark mix of disenfranchised lyrics coupled with enormously catchy tunes, in this case with added \"Doo-Wops\", giving the band a genuine crossover hit. The singles from HTMFAIP all charted well, propelling the decidedly unfashionable Terrorvision firmly into the mainstream.\\n\\nBy the time their third record, \"Regular Urban Survivors\" was released in 1996, Briptop was firmly established in the mainstream, but perhaps surprisingly Terrorvision thrived. Single \"Perseverance\" charted at number five (It\\'s awesome \"Whales and Dolphins\" hook proving irresistable to daytime radio and indie dancefloors alike) and the album was a commercial and critical hit. In many ways a bigger, widescreen sequel to HTMFAIP (with a couple of songs suspiciously close to re-makes - Bad Actress = Middleman, Celebrity Hitlist = Discotheque Wreck...) the cover featured the band larking around as spoof filmstars and was ostensibly a soundtrack to a fictional film - an idea reflected in songs such as \"Didn\\'t Bleed Red\" (sci-fi) and \"Dog Chewed the Handle\" (An implausible murder mystery) The band still got in a few digs in at the Briptop elite, with \"Superchronic\" taking a few swipes at Oasis.\\n\\nThe odd man out, though, of Terrorvision albums is without doubt 1998\\'s \"Shaving Peaches\", a curiously restrained record which in hindsight sounds like an ill-founded attempt to gain a mainstream audience which in truth they probably already had. Basically, TV forgot how to rock. Despite the album selling poorly, it ironically spawned their biggest hit, \"Tequila\". Admittedly it was a Mint Royale remix of the track which reached number 2, but in truth it didn\\'t differ that much from the original, adding only an irresistably immediate speed-mariachi tempo. The band took this in their stride - where other, cooler bands would have turned their nose up at such psuedo-success, Terrorvison cheekily just learned to play the remix live instead.\\n\\nDropped from major label EMI after \"Shaving Peaches\", Terrorvision finally returned in 2001 with the independently released \"Good To Go\". Probably knowing it would be their final record, it is very much a return to \\'classic\\' Terrorvision and in many ways a return to form. Whilst the record lacks some of their prime period sparkle, the choruses are undeniably huge and the album brims with the band\\'s trademark good time party vibes. \"Friends And Family\", in particular went down a storm at festivals, with its joyously profane \"Party Over Here, Fuck You Over There!\" refrain.\\n\\nTerrorvision played their \\'final\\' gig in October 2001, in their hometown of Bradford - a riotous celebration of all things TV which was eventually released as a double live album, \"Take The Money And Run\". \\n\\nSince Terrorvision split there have been a number of side projects including Tony Wright\\'s Laika Dog, Leigh Marklew\\'s Malibu Stacey and Mark Yates\\'s Blunderbuss and Boomville. Tony Wright has also released two solo albums and one country album with Ryan Hamilton, and tours with Milton \"Milly\" Evans performing acoustic versions of Terrorvision songs as well as his own material.\\n\\nUltimately Terrorvision were a wonderful oddity - despite coming from a undeniably Heavy Metal background, the band took the genre, (Which, lets not forget, was in terminal decline during the mid 90s) stripped away the po-faced seriousness, and fashioned a rock party band from the ashes. Often dismissed as a novelty act, TV in truth simply loved what they did, and never once considered being too cool to show it. Mark Yates\\'s urgent, exciting guitars anchored the band musically, but it\\'s Tony Wright\\'s hyper-go-go vocals which truly make the band, delighting in rolling his Yorkshire vowels around wordplay which lyrically is sometimes closer to rap than rock. They never hid behind the too-common pretence of disliking success - Terrorvision celebrated every foray into the mainstream and were never afraid to show it. At the same time, they surely gave a generation of Britpop kids a taste what rock delights could await them - witness the bands cover versions of Iggy Pop\\'s \"The Passenger\", Cheap Trick\\'s \"Surrender\", Free\\'s \"Wishing Well\" or perhaps most bizzarely, their lounge-blues version of Iron Maiden\\'s \"Take Your Daughter To the Slaughter\". They even dabbled with Paul Oakenfold remixes and their very own handbag-house-rock foray, B-side \"Too Stoned To Dance\". All hail Terrorvision then, Bradford\\' finest (and most proud) musical export. \\n\\nWhile they have never returned to music full-time, Terrorvision have reformed numerous times since their initial split. The first time was for a \\'one week only\\' tour in 2005, for which a live album and DVD were recorded, followed by a performance at Scarborough Castle later that year.\\n\\nIn 2007, the band announced that they were reforming again for a small number of gigs, this time without bassist and founding member Leigh Marklew. Danny Lambert, member of Mark Yates\\' band Blunderbuss, stood in for Leigh. The following year Leigh returned to the band and the original lineup performed on several short tours and festival appearances over the next few years, including a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"How To Make Friends and Influence People\", for which two live albums were made available - one recorded from the Manchester show, and one from the London show.\\n\\nIn 2010, drummer and founding member Ian \"Shutty\" Shuttleworth retired from the band and was replaced by Cameron Greenwood. Terrorvision announced that they were working on a new album, their first new music since 2001. The album, \"Super Delux\", was released in February 2011. The band continued to tour and make festival appearances, performing at Download Festival in 2012, their highest profile gig in some time.\\n\\nThe band went on hiatus from 2013-2016, returning for a one-off \\'Alternative Valentines\\' show on the 14th of February. Later that year they embarked on a UK tour supporting Thunder, and announced a headline tour at the end of the year for the 20th anniversary of \"Regular Urban Survivors\". A live album was released, recorded at the Manchester Ritz, as well as a behind-the-scenes DVD film, \"Wired Up and Scary\".\\n\\nSince 2016 the band have continued to perform on an annual basis, including a novel triple-headline tour in 2018 with Reef and The Wildhearts called \"Britrock Must Be Destroyed\", where the order of the bands would rotate from one gig to the next, and a 25th anniversary tour for \"How To Make Friends and Influence People\" in 2019.\\n\\nAlso in 2019, Terrorvision released their first new material since \"Super Delux\" eight years prior - the Christmas single \"Our Christmas Song\", as well as a pre-order exclusive download track \"By My Side\". The band have indicated their intention to release more new music during 2020, though whether this takes the form of an album, EP or individual tracks is currently unknown. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Terrorvision\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After a undeniably wise name change, the band released their first album \"Formaldehyde\" in 1992. Although showing their obvious Heavy Metal influences, there was a sense of humour and pop leaning which could not be hidden, particularly in their breakthrough single \"My House\". It was those pop quirks which informed their breakthrough second album \"How To Make Friends And Influence People\". A collection of exuberant pop-metal classics, it featured the single \"Oblivion\", which showed off TVs trademark mix of disenfranchised lyrics coupled with enormously catchy tunes, in this case with added \"Doo-Wops\", giving the band a genuine crossover hit. The singles from HTMFAIP all charted well, propelling the decidedly unfashionable Terrorvision firmly into the mainstream.\\n\\nBy the time their third record, \"Regular Urban Survivors\" was released in 1996, Briptop was firmly established in the mainstream, but perhaps surprisingly Terrorvision thrived. Single \"Perseverance\" charted at number five (It\\'s awesome \"Whales and Dolphins\" hook proving irresistable to daytime radio and indie dancefloors alike) and the album was a commercial and critical hit. In many ways a bigger, widescreen sequel to HTMFAIP (with a couple of songs suspiciously close to re-makes - Bad Actress = Middleman, Celebrity Hitlist = Discotheque Wreck...) the cover featured the band larking around as spoof filmstars and was ostensibly a soundtrack to a fictional film - an idea reflected in songs such as \"Didn\\'t Bleed Red\" (sci-fi) and \"Dog Chewed the Handle\" (An implausible murder mystery) The band still got in a few digs in at the Briptop elite, with \"Superchronic\" taking a few swipes at Oasis.\\n\\nThe odd man out, though, of Terrorvision albums is without doubt 1998\\'s \"Shaving Peaches\", a curiously restrained record which in hindsight sounds like an ill-founded attempt to gain a mainstream audience which in truth they probably already had. Basically, TV forgot how to rock. Despite the album selling poorly, it ironically spawned their biggest hit, \"Tequila\". Admittedly it was a Mint Royale remix of the track which reached number 2, but in truth it didn\\'t differ that much from the original, adding only an irresistably immediate speed-mariachi tempo. The band took this in their stride - where other, cooler bands would have turned their nose up at such psuedo-success, Terrorvison cheekily just learned to play the remix live instead.\\n\\nDropped from major label EMI after \"Shaving Peaches\", Terrorvision finally returned in 2001 with the independently released \"Good To Go\". Probably knowing it would be their final record, it is very much a return to \\'classic\\' Terrorvision and in many ways a return to form. Whilst the record lacks some of their prime period sparkle, the choruses are undeniably huge and the album brims with the band\\'s trademark good time party vibes. \"Friends And Family\", in particular went down a storm at festivals, with its joyously profane \"Party Over Here, Fuck You Over There!\" refrain.\\n\\nTerrorvision played their \\'final\\' gig in October 2001, in their hometown of Bradford - a riotous celebration of all things TV which was eventually released as a double live album, \"Take The Money And Run\". \\n\\nSince Terrorvision split there have been a number of side projects including Tony Wright\\'s Laika Dog, Leigh Marklew\\'s Malibu Stacey and Mark Yates\\'s Blunderbuss and Boomville. Tony Wright has also released two solo albums and one country album with Ryan Hamilton, and tours with Milton \"Milly\" Evans performing acoustic versions of Terrorvision songs as well as his own material.\\n\\nUltimately Terrorvision were a wonderful oddity - despite coming from a undeniably Heavy Metal background, the band took the genre, (Which, lets not forget, was in terminal decline during the mid 90s) stripped away the po-faced seriousness, and fashioned a rock party band from the ashes. Often dismissed as a novelty act, TV in truth simply loved what they did, and never once considered being too cool to show it. Mark Yates\\'s urgent, exciting guitars anchored the band musically, but it\\'s Tony Wright\\'s hyper-go-go vocals which truly make the band, delighting in rolling his Yorkshire vowels around wordplay which lyrically is sometimes closer to rap than rock. They never hid behind the too-common pretence of disliking success - Terrorvision celebrated every foray into the mainstream and were never afraid to show it. At the same time, they surely gave a generation of Britpop kids a taste what rock delights could await them - witness the bands cover versions of Iggy Pop\\'s \"The Passenger\", Cheap Trick\\'s \"Surrender\", Free\\'s \"Wishing Well\" or perhaps most bizzarely, their lounge-blues version of Iron Maiden\\'s \"Take Your Daughter To the Slaughter\". They even dabbled with Paul Oakenfold remixes and their very own handbag-house-rock foray, B-side \"Too Stoned To Dance\". All hail Terrorvision then, Bradford\\' finest (and most proud) musical export. \\n\\nWhile they have never returned to music full-time, Terrorvision have reformed numerous times since their initial split. The first time was for a \\'one week only\\' tour in 2005, for which a live album and DVD were recorded, followed by a performance at Scarborough Castle later that year.\\n\\nIn 2007, the band announced that they were reforming again for a small number of gigs, this time without bassist and founding member Leigh Marklew. Danny Lambert, member of Mark Yates\\' band Blunderbuss, stood in for Leigh. The following year Leigh returned to the band and the original lineup performed on several short tours and festival appearances over the next few years, including a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"How To Make Friends and Influence People\", for which two live albums were made available - one recorded from the Manchester show, and one from the London show.\\n\\nIn 2010, drummer and founding member Ian \"Shutty\" Shuttleworth retired from the band and was replaced by Cameron Greenwood. Terrorvision announced that they were working on a new album, their first new music since 2001. The album, \"Super Delux\", was released in February 2011. The band continued to tour and make festival appearances, performing at Download Festival in 2012, their highest profile gig in some time.\\n\\nThe band went on hiatus from 2013-2016, returning for a one-off \\'Alternative Valentines\\' show on the 14th of February. Later that year they embarked on a UK tour supporting Thunder, and announced a headline tour at the end of the year for the 20th anniversary of \"Regular Urban Survivors\". A live album was released, recorded at the Manchester Ritz, as well as a behind-the-scenes DVD film, \"Wired Up and Scary\".\\n\\nSince 2016 the band have continued to perform on an annual basis, including a novel triple-headline tour in 2018 with Reef and The Wildhearts called \"Britrock Must Be Destroyed\", where the order of the bands would rotate from one gig to the next, and a 25th anniversary tour for \"How To Make Friends and Influence People\" in 2019.\\n\\nAlso in 2019, Terrorvision released their first new material since \"Super Delux\" eight years prior - the Christmas single \"Our Christmas Song\", as well as a pre-order exclusive download track \"By My Side\". The band have indicated their intention to release more new music during 2020, though whether this takes the form of an album, EP or individual tracks is currently unknown. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Terrorvision\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "profile": "Terrorvision began their career as [a4497229], forming in 1986 in Bradford, UK.  The four piece band of Tony Wright (b. 6 May 1968; vocals), Mark Yates (b. 4 April 1968; guitar), Leigh Marklew (b. 10 August 1968: bass) and Shutty (b. 20 March 1967; drums) made little headway until a change of name to Terrorvision (inspired by a cult 80's horror film) in 1991 when [l=EMI Records] signed them on the back of demo tape \"Pump Action Sunshine.\"  The band negotiated with EMI the creation of their own label \"[l=Total Vegas Recordings]\" and in 1992 their debut EP \"Thrive\" was released by Total Vegas followed by the band's first LP \"Formaldehyde\" later in the year.  1994 saw the release of second album \"How To Make Friends And Influence People\" which generated a string of chart hits for the band including \"Oblivion\" and \"Alice, What's The Matter?\"  With third LP \"Regular Urban Survivors\" (1996) Terrorvision continued on their upward trajectory and single \"Perseverance\" earned the band their first top 5 hit with further chart success for singles \"Celebrity Hit List\" and \"Bad Actress\" though real chart domination was to come in January 1999 with the number 2 smash \"Tequila\" taken from the \"Shaving Peaches (1998) album.  Despite this, EMI chose to drop the band and in early 2000 the band (and Total Vegas Recordings) were rescued by [l=Papillon Records] for whom the band recorded the 2001 album \"Good To Go.\"  The reprieve however was temporary and in June 2001 the band announced their split marked by a farewell tour of the UK and a 'best of' album to satisfy EMI's five album contract entitled \"Whales & Dolphins.\"  In April 2005 the band reformed for a brief UK tour with further dates in August and September, which EMI took as a good excuse to release another compilation \"B-Sides & Rarities\".\r\n\r\nIn 2010 after replacing drummer 'Shutty', they started work on an album which was completed and released in 2011 under the title 'Super Deluxe'.\r\n",

        "profile": "Terrorvision began their career as [a4497229], forming in 1986 in Bradford, UK.  The four piece band of Tony Wright (b. 6 May 1968; vocals), Mark Yates (b. 4 April 1968; guitar), Leigh Marklew (b. 10 August 1968: bass) and Shutty (b. 20 March 1967; drums) made little headway until a change of name to Terrorvision (inspired by a cult 80's horror film) in 1991 when [l=EMI Records] signed them on the back of demo tape \"Pump Action Sunshine.\"  The band negotiated with EMI the creation of their own label \"[l=Total Vegas Recordings]\" and in 1992 their debut EP \"Thrive\" was released by Total Vegas followed by the band's first LP \"Formaldehyde\" later in the year.  1994 saw the release of second album \"How To Make Friends And Influence People\" which generated a string of chart hits for the band including \"Oblivion\" and \"Alice, What's The Matter?\"  With third LP \"Regular Urban Survivors\" (1996) Terrorvision continued on their upward trajectory and single \"Perseverance\" earned the band their first top 5 hit with further chart success for singles \"Celebrity Hit List\" and \"Bad Actress\" though real chart domination was to come in January 1999 with the number 2 smash \"Tequila\" taken from the \"Shaving Peaches (1998) album.  Despite this, EMI chose to drop the band and in early 2000 the band (and Total Vegas Recordings) were rescued by [l=Papillon Records] for whom the band recorded the 2001 album \"Good To Go.\"  The reprieve however was temporary and in June 2001 the band announced their split marked by a farewell tour of the UK and a 'best of' album to satisfy EMI's five album contract entitled \"Whales & Dolphins.\"  In April 2005 the band reformed for a brief UK tour with further dates in August and September, which EMI took as a good excuse to release another compilation \"B-Sides & Rarities\".\r\n\r\nIn 2010 after replacing drummer 'Shutty', they started work on an album which was completed and released in 2011 under the title 'Super Deluxe'.\r\n",

      "bio_content": "Terrorvision were formed in Bradford, (or more accurately the small town of Keighley) West Yorkshire, England in 1987, originally with the moniker \"The Spoilt Bratz\". After a undeniably wise name change, the band released their first album \"Formaldehyde\" in 1992. Although showing their obvious Heavy Metal influences, there was a sense of humour and pop leaning which could not be hidden, particularly in their breakthrough single \"My House\". It was those pop quirks which informed their breakthrough second album \"How To Make Friends And Influence People\". A collection of exuberant pop-metal classics, it featured the single \"Oblivion\", which showed off TVs trademark mix of disenfranchised lyrics coupled with enormously catchy tunes, in this case with added \"Doo-Wops\", giving the band a genuine crossover hit. The singles from HTMFAIP all charted well, propelling the decidedly unfashionable Terrorvision firmly into the mainstream.\n\nBy the time their third record, \"Regular Urban Survivors\" was released in 1996, Briptop was firmly established in the mainstream, but perhaps surprisingly Terrorvision thrived. Single \"Perseverance\" charted at number five (It's awesome \"Whales and Dolphins\" hook proving irresistable to daytime radio and indie dancefloors alike) and the album was a commercial and critical hit. In many ways a bigger, widescreen sequel to HTMFAIP (with a couple of songs suspiciously close to re-makes - Bad Actress = Middleman, Celebrity Hitlist = Discotheque Wreck...) the cover featured the band larking around as spoof filmstars and was ostensibly a soundtrack to a fictional film - an idea reflected in songs such as \"Didn't Bleed Red\" (sci-fi) and \"Dog Chewed the Handle\" (An implausible murder mystery) The band still got in a few digs in at the Briptop elite, with \"Superchronic\" taking a few swipes at Oasis.\n\nThe odd man out, though, of Terrorvision albums is without doubt 1998's \"Shaving Peaches\", a curiously restrained record which in hindsight sounds like an ill-founded attempt to gain a mainstream audience which in truth they probably already had. Basically, TV forgot how to rock. Despite the album selling poorly, it ironically spawned their biggest hit, \"Tequila\". Admittedly it was a Mint Royale remix of the track which reached number 2, but in truth it didn't differ that much from the original, adding only an irresistably immediate speed-mariachi tempo. The band took this in their stride - where other, cooler bands would have turned their nose up at such psuedo-success, Terrorvison cheekily just learned to play the remix live instead.\n\nDropped from major label EMI after \"Shaving Peaches\", Terrorvision finally returned in 2001 with the independently released \"Good To Go\". Probably knowing it would be their final record, it is very much a return to 'classic' Terrorvision and in many ways a return to form. Whilst the record lacks some of their prime period sparkle, the choruses are undeniably huge and the album brims with the band's trademark good time party vibes. \"Friends And Family\", in particular went down a storm at festivals, with its joyously profane \"Party Over Here, Fuck You Over There!\" refrain.\n\nTerrorvision played their 'final' gig in October 2001, in their hometown of Bradford - a riotous celebration of all things TV which was eventually released as a double live album, \"Take The Money And Run\". \n\nSince Terrorvision split there have been a number of side projects including Tony Wright's Laika Dog, Leigh Marklew's Malibu Stacey and Mark Yates's Blunderbuss and Boomville. Tony Wright has also released two solo albums and one country album with Ryan Hamilton, and tours with Milton \"Milly\" Evans performing acoustic versions of Terrorvision songs as well as his own material.\n\nUltimately Terrorvision were a wonderful oddity - despite coming from a undeniably Heavy Metal background, the band took the genre, (Which, lets not forget, was in terminal decline during the mid 90s) stripped away the po-faced seriousness, and fashioned a rock party band from the ashes. Often dismissed as a novelty act, TV in truth simply loved what they did, and never once considered being too cool to show it. Mark Yates's urgent, exciting guitars anchored the band musically, but it's Tony Wright's hyper-go-go vocals which truly make the band, delighting in rolling his Yorkshire vowels around wordplay which lyrically is sometimes closer to rap than rock. They never hid behind the too-common pretence of disliking success - Terrorvision celebrated every foray into the mainstream and were never afraid to show it. At the same time, they surely gave a generation of Britpop kids a taste what rock delights could await them - witness the bands cover versions of Iggy Pop's \"The Passenger\", Cheap Trick's \"Surrender\", Free's \"Wishing Well\" or perhaps most bizzarely, their lounge-blues version of Iron Maiden's \"Take Your Daughter To the Slaughter\". They even dabbled with Paul Oakenfold remixes and their very own handbag-house-rock foray, B-side \"Too Stoned To Dance\". All hail Terrorvision then, Bradford' finest (and most proud) musical export. \n\nWhile they have never returned to music full-time, Terrorvision have reformed numerous times since their initial split. The first time was for a 'one week only' tour in 2005, for which a live album and DVD were recorded, followed by a performance at Scarborough Castle later that year.\n\nIn 2007, the band announced that they were reforming again for a small number of gigs, this time without bassist and founding member Leigh Marklew. Danny Lambert, member of Mark Yates' band Blunderbuss, stood in for Leigh. The following year Leigh returned to the band and the original lineup performed on several short tours and festival appearances over the next few years, including a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"How To Make Friends and Influence People\", for which two live albums were made available - one recorded from the Manchester show, and one from the London show.\n\nIn 2010, drummer and founding member Ian \"Shutty\" Shuttleworth retired from the band and was replaced by Cameron Greenwood. Terrorvision announced that they were working on a new album, their first new music since 2001. The album, \"Super Delux\", was released in February 2011. The band continued to tour and make festival appearances, performing at Download Festival in 2012, their highest profile gig in some time.\n\nThe band went on hiatus from 2013-2016, returning for a one-off 'Alternative Valentines' show on the 14th of February. Later that year they embarked on a UK tour supporting Thunder, and announced a headline tour at the end of the year for the 20th anniversary of \"Regular Urban Survivors\". A live album was released, recorded at the Manchester Ritz, as well as a behind-the-scenes DVD film, \"Wired Up and Scary\".\n\nSince 2016 the band have continued to perform on an annual basis, including a novel triple-headline tour in 2018 with Reef and The Wildhearts called \"Britrock Must Be Destroyed\", where the order of the bands would rotate from one gig to the next, and a 25th anniversary tour for \"How To Make Friends and Influence People\" in 2019.\n\nAlso in 2019, Terrorvision released their first new material since \"Super Delux\" eight years prior - the Christmas single \"Our Christmas Song\", as well as a pre-order exclusive download track \"By My Side\". The band have indicated their intention to release more new music during 2020, though whether this takes the form of an album, EP or individual tracks is currently unknown. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Terrorvision\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
