      "biography": "The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. The original lineup consisted of Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner, who had all previously performed with Linda Ronstadt, contributing to her 1972 self-titled album. The group signed with Asylum Records and released their debut album, \"Eagles\", in 1972. The album produced the US and Canadian top-20 singles \"Take It Easy\" and \"Witchy Woman\".\n\nTheir second album, \"Desperado\" (1973), peaked at number 41 in the United States, and although the title track did not chart as a single, it gained lasting popularity. In 1974, Don Felder joined the band, contributing to the album \"On the Border\", which included the top-40 single \"Already Gone\" and their first number-one hit in the US and Canada, \"Best of My Love\". The 1975 album \"One of These Nights\" became their first US number-one album and achieved top-ten status in several other countries. It featured the US number-one single \"One of These Nights\", as well as the top-five hits \"Lyin' Eyes\" and \"Take It to the Limit\". That same year, Leadon left the group and was replaced by Joe Walsh.\n\nIn 1976, the band released the compilation album \"Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)\", which went on to become the best-selling album in the United States, with sales exceeding 38 million copies. Later that year, they released \"Hotel California\", which sold over 26 million copies in the US and more than 32 million globally. The album included the US and Canadian number-one singles \"New Kid in Town\" and \"Hotel California\", the latter also becoming their only top-ten hit in the United Kingdom and reaching the top ten in several other countries.\n\nIn 1977, Timothy B. Schmit replaced Meisner. The following year, the band released \"The Long Run\", which featured the US number-one single \"Heartache Tonight\" and the top-ten hits \"The Long Run\" and \"I Can't Tell You Why\". The band disbanded in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the release of \"Hell Freezes Over\", a combination of live recordings and new studio material, followed by a series of tours.\n\nIn 2007, the Eagles released \"Long Road Out of Eden\", which became their sixth US number-one album. This was followed by the Long Road Out of Eden Tour in 2008. In 2013, they began the History of the Eagles Tour, coinciding with the release of a documentary of the same name. After Glenn Frey's death in 2016, the band resumed touring in 2017 with his son Deacon Frey and country artist Vince Gill sharing lead vocals. Deacon Frey departed in 2022 but returned in 2023 for the band's final tour. Randy Meisner died in 2023.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)\n\nStudio albums\n\nEagles (1972)\nDesperado (1973)\nOn the Border (1974)\nOne of These Nights (1975)\nHotel California (1976)\nThe Long Run (1979)\nLong Road Out of Eden (2007) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

But here’s the crazy thing: the band’s most popular, career-defining song was still to come. That honour, of course, goes to the title track of their 1976 smash <i>Hotel California</i>, the record where the Eagles expunged any lingering trace of their country-rock roots and took up residence in the football stadiums of the world.<br />\nThat shift can be largely attributed to the new kid in town: Joe Walsh, who replaced outgoing founding guitarist Bernie Leadon. Formerly the frontman of dirty-boogie outfit the James Gang and an eccentric, hard-rockin’ solo artist in his own right, Walsh immediately puts his stamp on the band with the opening “Hotel California”, where he and six-string wingman Don Felder added the exclamation point to Don Henley’s eerie, enigmatic narrative with one of the most dramatic, finger-aching guitar solos in the rock canon. That swagger spills over into the brontosaurus stomp of “Victim of Love” (the closest this band ever got to heavy metal) and the disco-fied “Life in the Fast Lane”, an account of Hollywood hedonism as alluringly decadent as a penthouse masquerade ball with an open bar. But <i>Hotel California</i> is both a portrait of ’70s excess from behind the velvet rope and the soundtrack to the inevitably cruel comedown. In the sweeping yet cynical piano ballad “The Last Resort”, Henley is already bracing for the moment when the party has to end—not just for a band that would split within four years, but for the very notion of American capitalism itself.",

            "content": "Hotel California is an album released by the American rock band Eagles in late 1976. It is the first Eagles album without founding member Bernie Leadon and the first album with Joe Walsh. It is also the last album featuring original bass player and singer Randy Meisner.\n\nHotel California was the Eagles' fifth album of original material and became a critical success and a major commercial hit; since its release in late 1976, it has sold over 16 million copies in the U.S. alone. The album was at #1 for eight weeks in early 1977 (non-consecutively), and included two tracks which became #1 hits as singles on the Billboard Hot 100: \"New Kid in Town\", on February 26, 1977, and \"Hotel California\" on May 7, 1977.\n\nIn 2001 the TV network VH1 named Hotel California #38 on 100 Greatest Albums of all time. Hotel California was ranked 13th in a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 37 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nFollowing its original release on standard LP, cassette and 8-track cartridge formats, the album was slated for Quadraphonic release in early 1977; this idea was ultimately dropped following the demise of the Quadraphonic format. However, 25 years later, the album was released in a Multichannel 5.1 DVD-Audio disc.\n\nHotel California touched on many themes, including insanity, innocence (and the loss thereof), death, the dangers, drug addiction, temptation and transient nature of fame, shallow relationships, divorce and loss of love, the end results of manifest destiny, and the \"American Dream.\"\n\nMembers of Eagles have described the album as a metaphor for the perceived decline of America into materialism and decadence. In an interview with Dutch magazine ZigZag shortly before the album's release, Don Henley said:\n“ \tThis is a concept album, there's no way to hide it, but it's not set in the old West, the cowboy thing, you know. It's more urban this time (. . . ) It's our bicentennial year, you know, the country is 200 years old, so we figured since we are the Eagles and the Eagle is our national symbol, that we were obliged to make some kind of a little bicentennial statement using California as a microcosm of the whole United States, or the whole world, if you will, and to try to wake people up and say 'We've been okay so far, for 200 years, but we're gonna have to change if we're gonna continue to be around.' \t”\n\n\nThe album's final track, the epic \"The Last Resort\", was about the demise of society. Glenn Frey on the Hotel California episode of In the Studio with Redbeard explained about the track:\n“ \tIt was the first time that Don took it upon himself to write an epic story and we were already starting to worry about the environment...we're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. I mean we're putting junk, er, garbage into space now. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles/Hotel+California\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, 25 years later, the album was released in a Multichannel 5.1 DVD-Audio disc.\n\nHotel California touched on many themes, including insanity, innocence (and the loss thereof), death, the dangers, drug addiction, temptation and transient nature of fame, shallow relationships, divorce and loss of love, the end results of manifest destiny, and the \"American Dream.\"\n\nMembers of Eagles have described the album as a metaphor for the perceived decline of America into materialism and decadence. In an interview with Dutch magazine ZigZag shortly before the album's release, Don Henley said:\n“ \tThis is a concept album, there's no way to hide it, but it's not set in the old West, the cowboy thing, you know. It's more urban this time (. . . ) It's our bicentennial year, you know, the country is 200 years old, so we figured since we are the Eagles and the Eagle is our national symbol, that we were obliged to make some kind of a little bicentennial statement using California as a microcosm of the whole United States, or the whole world, if you will, and to try to wake people up and say 'We've been okay so far, for 200 years, but we're gonna have to change if we're gonna continue to be around.' \t”\n\n\nThe album's final track, the epic \"The Last Resort\", was about the demise of society. Glenn Frey on the Hotel California episode of In the Studio with Redbeard explained about the track:\n“ \tIt was the first time that Don took it upon himself to write an epic story and we were already starting to worry about the environment...we're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. I mean we're putting junk, er, garbage into space now. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles/Hotel+California\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
