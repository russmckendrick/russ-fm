      "biography": "In the 60s and 70s, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were a major part of the new comedy era, and Peter Cook was probably one of those who was the most responsible for the change in direction of comedy. He wrote a couple of well received revues for the West End, Pieces of Eight, and then One over the Eight, and then with Moore, Jonathon Miller and Alan Bennett, wrote and starred in Beyond the Fringe, the show that finally killed off the intimate review and replaced it with the Satire movement. Cook was the professional amongst the four and as such was paid more (although he actually received less due to his agent taking his cut!), and was responsible for a lot of the script, whereas Moore, was the musical one and came up with the parodies and musical interludes.\n\nNot Only But Also was their BBC show, written and conceived by the pair, which developed their partnership, and gave rise to the famous Dagenham Dialogues of Pete and Dud, and included other gems such as One Leg too Few, and Sir Arthur Streeb Greebling. Their way of writing was rather novel in as much as they would talk into a microphone, recording their impromptu speech and then review it, developing parts that they thought had promise and discarding the rest. The scripts were not written in stone though, and half of the charm of the show is the ad-libs from Cook and Moore's reactions to them, usually with him trying to hold back laughter.\n\nThe series ran for three series from 1965 to 1970, but alas, Auntie, in all her infinite wisdom chose to junk so many of the tapes and films. This was a real shame as it is purported that Cook tried desparately to buy them. That is what makes the release of this tape amongst the Comedy Greats range that much more worthwhile. The only downside is that is has been available before, so if you rushed out to buy The Best of...What's Left Of... Not Only... But Also some years ago, then their is no need to bother with this release (unless you have worn out your copy like I have!!!!). For those who have spent out on digital TV, then you will already have far more than the rest of us anyway as, from what I can make out, all the surviving shows have been broadcast on the UK ARENA channel.\n\nBoth had their separate careers though, and Dudley is an accomplished pianist and musician and went on to star in many films, whilst Cook was responsible for the first Satirical nightclub in London - The Establishment - and was a founding member of the Private Eye team. A new book that documents the satire boom of 1960s in the UK has just been published by Orion books, and is priced at a reasonable Â£20. This charts the members of Beyond the Fringe, the subsequent popularity of all things satire, Private Eye, The Establishment, and TW3, or That Was The Week That Was to the uninitiated. With a wealth of stills and excerpts of scripts, this brings together a lot of contemporary information with comments from those involved and is very well researched. In addition to the book, Orion have also released an audio cassette, however, I have not had a chance to review this yet - watch this space.\n\nThere is still a lot of interest in Cook and Moore and recently Moore was featured on BBC2's Arena documentary series - probably the last time he will do as he is in poor health. The programme concentrated more on the man and was all the better for it as it was a story that has seldom been investigated. Cook has not been forgotten either and was featured as one of the Comedian's Comedians on Radio 2. This series has been profiling various comedy artists that have made a huge impression on other comedy artists, and amongst those was Cook. Whilst only half and hour and littered with admirations from various contemporary comedians, the show also gives tantalising snippets of the great man at work. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Cook+&+Dudley+Moore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography": "Derek and Clive are controversial cult characters created by double act Dudley Moore and Peter Cook respectively on the records Derek and Clive (Live), 1976; Derek and Clive Come Again, 1977 and Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam, 1978 and a film documentary, Derek and Clive Get the Horn, 1979. The characters are seen as more foul-mouthed extensions of their earlier characters Pete and Dud. Though the recordings were far too controversial for television or a mainstream audience, Derek and Clive bootleg recordings circulated, becoming famous for their, mostly, unscripted dialogues, vulgar situations and copious use of profanity - especially the word \"cunt\".\n\nConsidered by many at the time as highly offensive, the comic sketches primarily took the form of bizarre, sometime drunken streams of consciousness led by Cook, with interjections from Moore. Memorable moments from the records include Clive claiming that the worst job he ever had was retrieving lobsters from Jayne Mansfield's bum, Derek claiming his worst job was cleaning up Winston Churchill's bogies (leading the pair to conclude that the Titanic was one such bogie), Clive claiming that he was sexually aroused by the sight of a deceased Pope lying in state and a brilliantly staged horse racing 'commentary' featuring horses named after sexual organs or their vulgarised derivatives.\n\nThe characters, supposedly two lavatory attendants (although in one sketch, 'Back of the Cab', they play the roles of two London taxi drivers) first surfaced in the mid-seventies. Cook and Moore were touring Broadway with their revue show \"Good Evening\", a live version of their television series \"Not Only... But Also.\" The relationship between the two had already become strained, as a result of Cook's increasing alcoholism. To reassure Moore, Cook hired out a recording studio in New York, where the two could simply relax, drink and ad-lib. The resulting recording was padded out with live performances of old favorites (such as \"Bo Duddley\"), and began to circulate as Derek and Clive (Live).\n\nCook became bemused at the idea that they should not be making money from the increasing popularity of Derek and Clive, and suggested to Moore that the recording should be released officially. By this point, Moore had embarked on a successful film career and found the tapes embarrassing, until he too realised his contemporaries were fans.\n\nA further two records were made. However, they became less like dialogues and more like vindictive attacks on the increasingly successful Moore by Cook, whose career had stalled somewhat in comparison.\n\nThese personal attacks culminated in an exasperated Moore eventually walking out of the Ad Nauseam sessions, effectively ending their comedy partnership which had begun nearly twenty years earlier. In one particularly cruel attack, on the \"Come Again\" record, Cook rants at length about his irritation at his father dying of cancer. He was fully aware that Moore's father was at the time dying of cancer, and that Moore was having a particularly hard time coping with this. Nevertheless, Moore, also fuelled by large quantities of drink, not only happily joins in ad-libbing the \"My Mum Song\", but is reduced to hysterical laughter by Cook's lyrics.\n\nThe same love-hate relationship between them is evident in the Derek and Clive Get the Horn movie, during which Moore withstands brutally vindictive verbal tirades from Cook and walks out in anger, only to return, and have Cook reduce him to helpless laughter again only minutes later. It's often, mistakenly, assumed that all of their releases were recorded while under the influence of alcohol. While this can be presumed of \"Come Again\" - where the sounds of bottles can be heard in the background and which features some tracks where both Cook and Moore are slurring their words, the videotaped release of \"Derek and Clive get the Horn\", most of which ended up on \"Ad Nauseam\", shows a very sober looking Cook and Moore drinking coffee and water throughout, although at one point Cook enquires to his partner, Judy Huxtable, where the J's are to be greeted with the response that \"Richard [Branson] has them\". During the recording, an organised prank was played upon Cook and Moore where the 'police' arrive and suspiciously sniff the contents of an ash tray to the dismay of the unnerved and wary pair. However, the first record \"Derek and Clive\" features studio tracks where both Cook and Moore are clearly sober. It's probable that this assumption is derived from the front and back cover of \"Come Again\" where Cook and Moore are holding drinks and appear to be drunk.\n\nLater taped and CD releases of \"Come Again\" and \"Ad Nauseam\" featured out-takes not previously released - most were recorded during the \"Ad Nauseam\" sessions. Surreal at times, these included \"Mother\" (featured on \"Derek and Clive get the Horn\") where Cook pretended to visit his over-possessive and deranged mum, ending with Cook telling Moore to \"shut your fucking face and die\" after Moore rants on about seeing Cook's \"Ticket\" - a reference to his penis, \"Intergalatic Sex\", \"Valerie's Hymen\", where Moore discussed cutting out his wife's hymen with a carving knife and \"Lady Vera Fart Teller\" where Moore elaborates on a visit to a fortune teller who could tell his future by examining his \"farts\". Transcripts of further, unreleased, 'out-takes' are available in a book entitled \"Come Again\", edited by William Cook and feature \"General Eisenhower\", where Cook reflects on the perils of counting the late General's dandruff flakes, \"Vietnam\", where Moore received a paper cut inflicted by the Viet Cong; in one insightful remark Cook mentions a \"friend\" of his who fought in Vietnam but he's not sure \"on which side\" and \"A Million Pounds\", where Cook plays an hysterical woman looking for a million pounds off a sympathetic Moore. The remaining unreleased out-takes are variations on actual releases.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Derek+&+Clive\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
