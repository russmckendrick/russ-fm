      "biography": "Fleetwood Mac is a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood Mac was founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy Spencer, before bassist John McVie joined the lineup for their self-titled debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist Christine Perfect (later known as Christine McVie), who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970.\n\nPrimarily a British blues band, Fleetwood Mac scored a UK number one with \"Albatross\", and had other hits such as the singles \"Oh Well\" and \"Man of the World\". All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists Bob Welch and Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, all three of them had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band.\n\nThe addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, Fleetwood Mac, reached No. 1 in the United States. Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) separated while continuing to make music together.\n\nThe band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of Bill Clinton featured the lineup of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, The Dance (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of Rumours. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, Say You Will, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band and was replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House.\n\nFleetwood Mac has sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, the group was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998 the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nDanny Kirwan, guitarist, songwriter and early member of Fleetwood Mac (1968–1972) died in London, England, on 8 June 2018, aged 68. An obituary in The New York Times said he had died in his sleep after contracting pneumonia earlier in the year. The British music magazine Mojo quoted Christine McVie as saying: \"Danny Kirwan was the white English blues guy. Nobody else could play like him. He was a one-off ... Danny and Peter [Green] gelled so well together. Danny had a very precise, piercing vibrato – a unique sound ... He was a perfectionist; a fantastic musician and a fantastic writer.\" One of Kirwan's songs, \"Tell Me All the Things You Do\" from the 1970 album Kiln House, was included in the set of the 2018–19 An Evening with Fleetwood Mac tour.\n\nOn 28 May 2020 Neil Finn, featuring Nicks and McVie, with Campbell on guitar, released the song “Find Your Way Back Home” for the Auckland, New Zealand homeless shelter Auckland City Mission. \n\nFounding member Peter Green died on 25 July 2020 at the age of 73. In October 2020, Rumours again entered the Billboard top 10. The album received 30.6 million plays on streaming platforms the week of October 15, after a TikTok video of the song \"Dreams\" went viral.\n\nOn 30 November 2022, it was announced that  band member Christine McVie died at the age of 79, after a short illness.\n\nOn 18 June 2024, band member Stevie Nicks stated that there would be \"no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac together in anyway\" after the passing of Christine McVie. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> To understand what made <i>Rumours</i> so impactful, you have to look at the music that came out around it. This was the era of the Eagles and Linda Ronstadt: artists who, like Fleetwood Mac, combined the intimacy of singer-songwriters with a softened take on rock ’n’ roll. But it was also the era of Boston, Foreigner, Pink Floyd and a wave of bands that scaled up the ambition of ’60s rock to blockbuster heights—stuff that parents who loved doo-wop and early Beatles records might not care about, but millions of teenagers would. Not to mention Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond, ABBA and the Bee Gees, and The Clash and Patti Smith—all of whom were totally different, but who collectively drove pop-rock to greater extremes of showmanship, polish and rebellion.\n \nAnd there, in the middle of the road, is <i>Rumours</i>. When they rock, they do it gently (“The Chain”), but with a bite that sets them apart from their adult-contemporary contemporaries (“Go Your Own Way”). And while they capture the carefree positivity of the good life (and the Baby Boomers living it), they don’t shy away from the pains it took to get there (“Don’t Stop”, “Dreams”). As beautifully as their musical personalities meld (the blues-raised rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, the romanticism of Christine McVie, pop perfectionism of Lindsey Buckingham and mysticism of Stevie Nicks), you can always hear them tugging gently on each other, an internal drama that’s all the more poignant given how restrained the final product is.\n\nRadical? No: In some ways, <i>Rumours</i> sounds like it doesn’t know the wilder developments of the late 1960s—psychedelia, experimental and progressive rock—even happened. But for an album that went on to sell more than 10 million copies, it’s tougher and more unsettling than it probably should be. The band has given plenty of interviews over the years attesting to how they strove to serve the song, no matter how painful or personal—which, in the context of Buckingham’s “Go You Own Way” or Nicks’ “Dreams”, must’ve been very, let alone John McVie backing up his newly ex-wife on a song about how fulfilled she is in her current relationship (“You Make Loving Fun”). Co-producer Ken Caillat remembers watching Buckingham and Nicks scream at each other during recordings, only to compose themselves just in time for the tape to start rolling. It’s a good metaphor: Even if you ignore the album’s soap opera (which included the implosion of three relationships, two of them between couples in the band), <i>Rumours</i> captures the pain of a band keeping it perfectly together while in the midst of falling apart.",

            "content": "Rumours is the eleventh studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. Largely recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Don't Stop\", \"Dreams\", and \"You Make Loving Fun\" were released as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide, and diamond certifications in several countries, including the US, UK and Australia.\n\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\n\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.\n\nIn July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's tenth album was released to great commercial success, eventually selling over four million copies and reaching #1 in 1976. The record's hit single \"Rhiannon\" gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending nearly eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975's Fleetwood Mac and after guitarist Bob Welch had left were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, had an affair with his best friend.\n\nPress intrusions into the band members' lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood's daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a 10th anniversary tour. Despite false reports, the band did not change line-up, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began. Fleetwood has noted the \"tremendous emotional sacrifices\" made by everyone just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, Keith Olsen, because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section. The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band's interests.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Rumours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
