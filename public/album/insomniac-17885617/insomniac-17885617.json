      "biography": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk, and has been a member of the band since.\nGreen Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums over the course of five months starting in September 2012. The three albums will be called Â¡Uno!, Â¡Dos!, and Â¡Tré!, and will be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively.\nGreen Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design.",

Green Day’s emergence as punk’s most famous pop superstars never made them flinch, never made them question their approach. Unlike other alternative bands who felt a need to further explore their sonic realm, Green Day were a melodic punk band who saw their role as writing fast, strong songs that fans could dance and pogo to without thinking. “Walking Contradiction” attempts to make sense of this dichotomy, but the truth is in the irresistible hooks. “Geek Stink Breath” is a brilliant pop hook brought to further life with production that never tries to soften the attack.",

            "content": "Insomniac is the fourth studio album from the punk rock band Green Day. It was released on October 10, 1995, through the Reprise Records label. Though it reached number two in the United States and went double Platinum (According to the RIAA) by 1996, Insomniac did not have the sales endurance of its predecessor, Dookie, largely due to its slightly darker lyrical tone and heavier, more abrasive sound. The album is the band's third-best selling album behind Dookie and American Idiot with over 7 million copies sold worldwide.\nn 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"\n\nBefore the name 'Insomniac', the band considered the naming the album Tight Wad Hill (After the thirteenth track of the album) After visiting collage artist Winston Smith for the album cover, Billie Joe Armstrong asked him how he managed to make such intricate pieces in such short times. Smith answered, \"It's easy for me. I am an insomniac.\"\nThe collage on the album cover was created by Winston Smith  and is called God Told Me to Skin You Alive, a reference to the Dead Kennedys song \"I Kill Children\". Interestingly enough, the cover art contains an image (the dentist) that was originally used in a collage featured in the inside cover art of Dead Kennedys' album Plastic Surgery Disasters. Smith knew Tré Cool from Green Day's time at Lookout! Records and told Tré that if he ever needed album artwork that he should call him. The cover art features several hidden images: a naked woman, 3 fairies, and several other ghostly faces in the flames. There are also three skulls on the entire album cover and back; one for each member of Green Day. One of the skulls requires you to view the piece at an angle. The hidden skull is taken from Hans Holbein's 1533 painting 'The Ambassadors'. Green Day's version, however, is slightly different from the original, with the woman holding Billie Joe's sky blue Fernandes imitation Stratocaster rather than an acoustic guitar. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/Insomniac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is the band's third-best selling album behind Dookie and American Idiot with over 7 million copies sold worldwide.\nn 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"\n\nBefore the name 'Insomniac', the band considered the naming the album Tight Wad Hill (After the thirteenth track of the album) After visiting collage artist Winston Smith for the album cover, Billie Joe Armstrong asked him how he managed to make such intricate pieces in such short times. Smith answered, \"It's easy for me. I am an insomniac.\"\nThe collage on the album cover was created by Winston Smith  and is called God Told Me to Skin You Alive, a reference to the Dead Kennedys song \"I Kill Children\". Interestingly enough, the cover art contains an image (the dentist) that was originally used in a collage featured in the inside cover art of Dead Kennedys' album Plastic Surgery Disasters. Smith knew Tré Cool from Green Day's time at Lookout! Records and told Tré that if he ever needed album artwork that he should call him. The cover art features several hidden images: a naked woman, 3 fairies, and several other ghostly faces in the flames. There are also three skulls on the entire album cover and back; one for each member of Green Day. One of the skulls requires you to view the piece at an angle. The hidden skull is taken from Hans Holbein's 1533 painting 'The Ambassadors'. Green Day's version, however, is slightly different from the original, with the woman holding Billie Joe's sky blue Fernandes imitation Stratocaster rather than an acoustic guitar. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/Insomniac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
