Squeeze are a rock band which formed in London, England in 1974. The band was formed by songwriters Glenn Tilbrook (vocals, guitar) and Chris Difford (guitar, vocals) who have been the group's only constant members since the band's formation (with the exception of Difford's hiatus from the band in 1999). Aside from Difford and Tilbrook, the band currently consists of Stephen Large (keyboards), Lucy Shaw (bass) and Simon Hanson (drums).\n\nThe group initially split in 1982, but reunited in 1985 until splitting once more in 1999. Difford and Tilbrook reunited the band in 2007 with bassist John Bentley (who had been a member of the band from 1980 to 1982), keyboardist Stephen Large and drummer Simon Hanson.\n\nThe original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland.  Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike and the Mechanics as well as a solo artist.\n\nSince the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks.\n\nIn 2007, Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain. These dates are to support a new Greatest Hits CD and DVD (Essential Squeeze- released 30/04/07)  Glenn Tilbrook is also releasing his original demos on CD, the first of these (The Past Has Been Bottled) is also released on 30/04/07. \n\n2.

      "editorial_notes": "<i>Singles - 45’s and Under</i> is one of the few hits compilations with a legitimate claim as the artist’s definitive work. The tight 12-track collection covers the English New Wave band’s early run from 1978 through 1982 in chronological order, which just so happens to make for a perfectly paced running order. Songwriting duo Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook were on fire in this period, turning out precisely calibrated pop compositions with clever, sophisticated lyrics that were particular to their quirky sensibilities, but in line with other stylish songwriters of the time like Nick Lowe, Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello—who had produced their 1981 record <i>East Side Story</i>.\n\nEvery song in the collection is expertly built so the chronological track listing doesn’t necessarily show an obvious creative evolution. However, the aesthetic jumps—from the half-Kraftwerk, half-Bond theme vibe of the early single “Take Me I’m Yours” to the twitchy synth-pop of “Slap and Tickle” to the mannered formalism of “Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)” to the blue-eyed soul of “Tempted” and “Black Coffee in Bed”—correspond to shifting fashions in English rock through that short window of time.\n\n“Annie Get Your Gun”, the one non-album track featured in the compilation, was initially understood as a farewell single, as the band broke up shortly after its release. Difford and Tillbrook reformed the group a few years later, and though they’ve written some strong material since, very little of it measures up to the consistent brilliance of the songs featured here.",
