      "biography": "Janet Damita Jo Jackson is an American recording artist and actress. Known for a series of sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows, television and film roles, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over 25 years. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame.\nAfter signing a recording contract with A&M in 1982, she came to prominence following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover appeal in popular music. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio airplay and MTV, she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.\nIn 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest paid artists in the industry. Her debut album under the label, Janet (1993), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s, Billboard named her the second most successful recording artist of the decade, following Mariah Carey. She has amassed an extensive catalog of hits, with singles such as \"Nasty\", \"Rhythm Nation\", \"That's the Way Love Goes\", \"Together Again\", and \"All for You\" her most iconic.\nHaving sold over 100 million records, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists her as the eleventh best-selling female artist in the United States, with 26 million certified albums. In 2008, Billboard magazine released its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, ranking her at number seven. In 2010, the magazine announced the \"Top 50 R&B / Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\", ranking her at number five. One of the world's most awarded artists, her longevity, records and achievements reflect her influence in shaping and redefining the scope of popular music. She has been cited as an inspiration among numerous performers.",

By the time of <i>Control</i>’s release in 1986, the budding superstar had released two albums—1982’s <i>Janet Jackson</i> and 1984’s <i>Dream Street</i>—and scored R&B hits like “Young Love” and “Don’t Stand Another Chance”. But the jury was still out on whether she was just capitalising on her appearances on such TV sitcoms as <i>Good Times</i> and <i>Diff’rent Strokes</i>—or, perhaps even more so, her nepo-sibling connection to the ascending King of Pop, Michael Jackson.\n\nBut all that changed when Jackson—after bossing up and firing her own father, Joe Jackson, as her manager—went to Minneapolis to work with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on what would be her true debut. The pairing of streetwise Prince protégés with sheltered music royalty was an odd coupling that worked against the odds, putting a nasty spin on Minneapolis funk that was all Miss Jackson; the result was one of the most successful and enduring artist-producer collaborations in pop history. At the time of <i>Control</i>’s release, pop’s heart was thumping to the likes of Madonna and Whitney Houston, and maintained by radio and MTV—but Jackson gave it a whole new beat.\n\nIndeed, when Jackson commanded “Gimme a beat!” at the beginning of “Nasty”—one of her countless hits—she was leading a new music movement for Black female empowerment, from Beyoncé and Rihanna to SZA and Doja Cat today. There is a militant assault in the fierce funk of her first single, “What Have You Done for Me Lately” (a tune that kicks off with what would become one of her trademark interludes). And the in-your-face title track foreshadows 1989’s <i>Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814</i>. But there is also a girlish giddiness to “When I Think of You”, Jackson’s first chart-topper, and a slow-jam sexiness to the album’s finale “Funny How Time Flies (When You’re Having Fun)”—both elements that would become defining pleasure principles for Jackson in the years ahead.",

            "content": "Control is the third studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986 by A&M Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of dance-pop, rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap vocals, and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators among pop and contemporary R&B. It enabled Jackson to transition into the popular music market, becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.\n\nContaining autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to the singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization.\n\nControl is widely regarded as the breakthrough album of Jackson's career. It became her first album to top the Billboard 200 and five of its commercial singles—\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\", \"Nasty\", \"Control\", \"When I Think of You\", and \"Let's Wait Awhile\"—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV's evolving demographics. The album went on to receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987. It is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time.
