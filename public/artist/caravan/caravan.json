Caravan are a British progressive rock band from Canterbury, United Kingdom, founded by former Wilde Flowers members David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair, Pye Hastings, and Richard Coughlan. Caravan rose to success over a period of several years from 1968 onwards into the 1970s as part of the Canterbury scene which also included Soft Machine. Caravan still continue a part-time gigging existence into the present.\n\nThe band were largely dormant in the 1980s, but a 1990 reunion, planned as a one-off for U.K. television's Bedrock show, restarted their career.

Their tunes & lyrics were a vital force for bringing the messages of urban student activism out to the provinces. In the wake of the massacre at thammasat university, the band fled Bangkok, some heading into the mountains of the northeast to join the communist insurgency in armed struggle.
