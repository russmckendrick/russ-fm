  "biography": "NOFX were an American punk rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. Bassist/lead vocalist Fat Mike, rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin and drummer Erik Sandin were original founding and longest-serving members of the band, who have appeared on every release by the band, although Sandin departed briefly in 1985, only to rejoin the following year. El Hefe joined the band in 1991 to play lead guitar and trumpet, rounding out the best-known iteration of the lineup.\n\nNOFX's mainstream success coincided with increased interest in punk rock during the 1990s; unlike many of their contemporaries, however, they had never been signed to a major label. NOFX released fifteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays and a number of 7\" singles over a career spanning more than four decades. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album Punk in Drublic (1994), which is their only release to receive a gold certification by the RIAA. Their fifteenth and final studio album, Double Album, was released on December 2, 2022. The group has sold over eight million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent bands ever. In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on Fuse entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport. The band retired after a 2024 tour.\n\nStudio albums\nLiberal Animation (1988)\nS&M Airlines (1989)\nRibbed (1991)\nWhite Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean (1992)\nPunk in Drublic (1994)\nHeavy Petting Zoo (1996)\nSo Long and Thanks for All the Shoes (1997)\nPump Up the Valuum (2000)\nThe War on Errorism (2003)\nWolves in Wolves' Clothing (2006)\nCoaster (2009)\nSelf Entitled (2012)\nFirst Ditch Effort (2016)\nSingle Album (2021)\nDouble Album (2022) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/NOFX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
