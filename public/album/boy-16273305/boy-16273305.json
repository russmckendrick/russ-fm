      "biography": "U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976. The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.\n\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, War (1983), and singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, The Unforgettable Fire (1984), was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, whose influence resulted in the band experimenting with a more abstract, ambient sound. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Their fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date: \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\".\n\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album, Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991) and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on their eighth album, Zooropa (1993), and concluded following their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Although their twelfth album, No Line on the Horizon (2009), did not meet commercial expectations, their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour, both of which stood until 2019. In the 2010s, U2 released the companion albums Songs of Innocence (2014) and Songs of Experience (2017), the former of which received criticism for its pervasive, no-cost release through the iTunes Store. Their most recent album, Songs of Surrender (2023), consists of reimagined versions of 40 songs from their career.\n\nU2 have released 15 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, working with organisations and coalitions that include Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, DATA/the ONE Campaign, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.",

      "editorial_notes": "One of the greatest debut albums of the 1980s—which is saying <i>a lot</i>, given how bountiful that decade turned out to be—U2’s <i>Boy</i> is a burst of pent-up energy and ambition. Released at a moment in which punk, post-punk, and New Wave were swirling and collapsing into one another, <i>Boy</i> throws all of that noise all together in a mix of jagged guitars, jubilant rhythms and good old-fashioned angry-young-man <i>ennui</i>. It’s not U2’s most hit-packed record, nor its most fully formed, but <i>Boy</i> may simply be the most <i>U2</i>-ish album U2 ever made: The sound of four musicians confused about where they’re going next, but supremely confident they’ll get there—a mindset that would come to define the band in the decades ahead.\n\nBack in 1980, the members of U2—vocalist Bono, guitarist the Edge, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr.—were brash upstarts with a reputation for fiery gigs, but little in the way of in-studio experience. The group had made an inauspicious debut with 1979’s <i>Three</i>, a quickly recorded EP, and followed it up with a handful of singles, most notably “11 O’Clock Tick Tock”, a gnarly post-punk rave-up so indebted to The Cure, it likely raised Robert Smith’s eyebrows (as well as his hairdo).\n\n<i>Boy</i> would be the group’s most grown-up effort yet. Produced by Steve Lillywhite—who’d caught the group during a late-1970s live show in Ireland, and who’d work with the group repeatedly in the coming decades—the album captures 20-year-old Bono’s anguished post-adolescent worldview. “Out of Control”, with its stomping drums and dreamy guitars, is a frenzied lament for the end of childhood, while “An Cat Dubh” is an appropriately throbbing tale of young lust. On later U2 albums, you can hear Bono laboring—sometimes painfully so—to make sure his words are pointed, and that his message rings clear. The lyrics on <i>Boy</i>, however, capture a frenzied state of mind, as though Bono was collecting his thoughts at the exact moment he stepped up to the mic.\n\nNowhere is that urgency felt more strongly than on “I Will Follow”, the album’s opening track, and its most indelible. Built on the Edge’s scraping guitars and Mullen and Clayton’s vicious groove, ”I Will Follow” is part stirring rock-pop anthem, part mission statement—a delirious promise of loyalty that would become U2’s first undeniable hit song. “I was on the outside,” Bono sings as the song gets underway. Thanks to <i>Boy</i>, he wouldn’t be out there for long much longer—and neither would U2.",

The group had made an inauspicious debut with 1979’s <i>Three</i>, a quickly recorded EP, and followed it up with a handful of singles, most notably “11 O’Clock Tick Tock”, a gnarly post-punk rave-up so indebted to The Cure, it likely raised Robert Smith’s eyebrows (as well as his hairdo).\n\n<i>Boy</i> would be the group’s most grown-up effort yet. Produced by Steve Lillywhite—who’d caught the group during a late-1970s live show in Ireland, and who’d work with the group repeatedly in the coming decades—the album captures 20-year-old Bono’s anguished post-adolescent worldview. “Out of Control”, with its stomping drums and dreamy guitars, is a frenzied lament for the end of childhood, while “An Cat Dubh” is an appropriately throbbing tale of young lust. On later U2 albums, you can hear Bono laboring—sometimes painfully so—to make sure his words are pointed, and that his message rings clear. The lyrics on <i>Boy</i>, however, capture a frenzied state of mind, as though Bono was collecting his thoughts at the exact moment he stepped up to the mic.\n\nNowhere is that urgency felt more strongly than on “I Will Follow”, the album’s opening track, and its most indelible. Built on the Edge’s scraping guitars and Mullen and Clayton’s vicious groove, ”I Will Follow” is part stirring rock-pop anthem, part mission statement—a delirious promise of loyalty that would become U2’s first undeniable hit song. “I was on the outside,” Bono sings as the song gets underway. Thanks to <i>Boy</i>, he wouldn’t be out there for long much longer—and neither would U2."

            "content": "Boy is the debut studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite and was released on 20 October 1980 by Island Records. Boy contains songs from the band's 40-song repertoire at the time, including two tracks that were re-recorded from their original versions on the group's debut release, the EP Three.\n\nBoy was recorded from July to September 1980 at Dublin's Windmill Lane Studios, which became U2's chosen recording location during the 1980s. It was their first time working with Lillywhite, who employed non-standard production techniques, such as recording drummer Larry Mullen Jr. playing in a stairwell, and recording smashed bottles and cutlery skimmed against a spinning bicycle wheel. The band found Lillywhite to be very encouraging and creative, and he subsequently became a frequent producer of their recorded work.
