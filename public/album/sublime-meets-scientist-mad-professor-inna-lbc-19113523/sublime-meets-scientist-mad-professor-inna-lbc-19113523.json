      "biography": "Sublime are an American reggae rock and ska punk band from Long Beach, California, formed in 1988. The band's line-up, unchanged until their initial breakup, consisted of Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass), and Bud Gaugh (drums). Lou Dog, Nowell's dalmatian, was the mascot of the band. Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996, resulting in Sublime's breakup. In 1997, songs such as \"What I Got\", \"Santeria\", \"Wrong Way\", \"Doin' Time\", and \"April 29, 1992 (Miami)\" were released to U.S. radio.\n\nSublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums (one of which also contains never-before released material), three EPs, and one box set. Although their first two albums—40oz. to Freedom (1992) and Robbin' the Hood (1994)—were quite popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell's death, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the single \"What I Got\", which remains the band's only No. 1 hit single (on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart) in their musical career. As of 2009, the band has sold over 17 million albums worldwide, including about ten million in the U.S. alone. Michael \"Miguel\" Happoldt and Marshall \"Ras MG\" Goodman contributed to several Sublime songs.\n\nFollowing Sublime's dissolution, former members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh founded the Long Beach Dub Allstars in 1997, which also included many frequent Sublime contributors such as Michael \"Miguel\" Happoldt (former member of The Ziggens), Marshall Goodman \"Ras MG\" (former Sublime member), and Todd Forman (3rd Alley). LBDAS disbanded in 2002, due to several members of the band breaking a no-drug vow they had taken.  In 2009, the surviving members attempted to reform the band with Rome Ramirez, a young guitarist and admitted Sublime fan from California. However, not long after performing at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name as they needed permission from Nowell's estate, which owns the rights to the Sublime name. This prompted the lineup of Wilson, Gaugh and Ramirez to change their name to Sublime with Rome, which has since released three albums, although Gaugh left the group shortly after the release of their 2011 debut Yours Truly. \n\nWith the mainstream success of their self-titled album, going five times platinum and earning worldwide airplay, Sublime's influence persists to this day. Sublime was one of the most popular bands of the third wave of ska, specifically characterized as ska punk. Sublime often combined punk rock and hardcore punk with hip hop, heavy metal, dancehall, reggae, ska, funk, and (21st century) surf music. Sublime also has been described as 'reggae rock'.\n\nTheir signature sound and their songs are often associated with the beach and coastal areas of Southern California, such as San Diego, Orange County, Venice Beach and Long Beach as well as areas of Northern California like Eureka. Over two decades after Nowell's death and the band's breakup, Sublime remains immensely popular throughout North America, especially in its state of origin, California.\n\nSublime's songs have been featured via soundtrack in a variety of media. Los Angeles alternative rock radio station KROQ has listed Sublime at No. 3 in their annual \"Top 106.7 biggest KROQ bands of all time\" list for the past six years in a row, behind Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana, and No. 81 at the \"Top 166 Artists of 1980–2008\" list.\n\nWith over 17 million units sold worldwide, Sublime is one of the most successful, and \"powerfully moving\" ska-punk acts of all time influencing many modern reggae and ska acts.\n\nWilson and Gaugh reunited the group officially in 2023 after Sublime With Rome's disbanding, with Nowell's son Jakob Nowell (LAW, Jakob's Castle) taking over as lead vocalist. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sublime\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
