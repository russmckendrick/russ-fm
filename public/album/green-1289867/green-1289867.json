      "biography": "R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry. One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention due to Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. R.E.M. disbanded in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.",

      "editorial_notes": "Released in 1988, <i>Green</i> marked R.E.M.’s sixth album in as many years—an output made possible by the fact that all four band members were songwriters. On the group’s high-speed voyage from a weird, beloved alternative rock band to mainstream stardom, R.E.M. lost thousands of fans—but gained millions more, a process that only accelerated with <i>Green</i>.\n\nSinger Michael Stipe had mixed feelings about being on the charts beside Def Leppard and INXS, which is apparent in the opening track. “Pop Song 89” is a pop song that makes fun of pop songs for being vapid, and seems to doubt the entire enterprise of communication. It’s rescued from self-consciousness by Stipe’s droll ad-libs, Mike Mills’ fuzzed-out bass and Peter Buck’s whipsaw guitar licks. Stipe said “Pop Song 89” and “Stand”, which follows three songs later, were two of the band’s “fruit loop songs”—by which he meant they were colourful, overly sweet and longer on sensation than nutrition.\n\n“Get Up” and “Turn You Inside-Out” turn back the clock and return to the group’s earlier sound, as does “World Leader Pretend”, until a cello line (played by Jane Scarpantoni) and pedal steel guitar (by Bucky Baxter) ease up out of the arrangement. For every look back, the band members wanted to take two steps forward, which could mean anything from finding new chord progressions to introducing new instruments. So Peter Buck plays mandolin on three songs—and even takes up the drums on “Untitled”—while drummer Bill Berry switches to bass on a few numbers, allowing bassist Mike Mills to play keyboards and accordion.\n\nThe lyrics on <i>Green</i> often dwell on contradiction, so in “Orange Crush”, which Stipe said was about a bon vivant who goes off to serve in Vietnam, the chorus presents two options—“Follow me/Don’t follow me”—and doesn’t favour either one, and in “World Leader Pretend”, a solitary character boasts about his sophisticated level of self-awareness, but the wisdom doesn’t seem to be helping him. R.E.M.’s album-a-year pace ended here, and when they returned three years later, it was clear that <i>Green</i> was a tentative first draft of a new sound based on the polar opposites of celebratory pop and moody acoustic ballads.",
