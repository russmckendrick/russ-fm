      "biography": "Depeche Mode are an English Synthpop band founded in 1980, originally from Basildon, Essex, United Kingdom. They are one of the most enduring and successful bands that emerged during the 80s, particularly from the new wave/new romantic era. The band name is derived from a French fashion magazine, Dépêche Mode, which means \"fashion dispatch.\" Depeche Mode are one of the most influential bands in the world, having influenced hundreds of legendary bands like Rammstein, Nine Inch Nails, Linkin Park, Paradise Lost, Marilyn Manson, and Lacuna Coil.\n\nThe band has been highly influential in the electronic dance music scene, especially synthpop, techno, and trance, partly due to their innovative work, recording techniques, and use of sampling. Their most successful album is arguably 1990's Violator, which reached the #2 position in the UK, #7 in the US, and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The band has released a long series of high-charting singles over their three-decades long career. Enjoy the Silence is their most recognized song and one of history's most covered songs.\n\nThe original line-up was Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Vince Clarke. In December 1981, Clarke left the band and later formed Yazoo, The Assembly, and Erasure. Alan Wilder joined the group initially in January 1982 as a live keyboardist but became an official member in December 1982. He left in mid-1995 to fully concentrate on his Recoil project, and the band continued as a trio. In 2010 Wilder re-joined Depeche Mode on stage after 16 years for a performance of Somebody during a show at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nDepeche Mode's origins date back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore, and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards, and Fletcher on bass. Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke, and Fletcher switched to synthesizers. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" and Depeche Mode was born. \n\nWhile playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, approached the band, who proposed a verbal contract. The result was their first single,  Dreaming of Me, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981, reaching number 57 in the UK charts and followed soon by a real contract with Mute.\n\nTo date, Depeche Mode have released:\n15 studio albums: Speak & Spell (1981), A Broken Frame (1982), Construction Time Again (1983), Some Great Reward (1984), Black Celebration (1986), Music For the Masses (1987), Violator (1990), Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993), Ultra (1997), Exciter (2001), Playing the Angel (2005),  Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013), Spirit (2017), and Memento Mori (2023);\n8 compilations: People Are People (1984), The Singles 81-85 (1985), Catching Up with Depeche Mode (1985), Greatest Hits (1987), The Singles 86>98 (1998), Remixes 81-04 (2004), The Best Of Depeche Mode Volume 1 (2006), The Complete Depeche Mode (2006);\n5 live albums: 101 (1989), Songs of Faith and Devotion Live (1993), Recording the Angel (a series of live recordings; 2006), Tour Of The Universe: Barcelona 20/21:11:09 (2009) and Live In Berlin (Soundtrack) (2014) ;\nOver 50 singles:  including Just Can't Get Enough, Everything Counts, People Are People, Master and Servant, Shake the Disease, Stripped, A Question of Time, Strangelove, Never Let Me Down Again, Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth, I Feel You, Walking in My Shoes, In Your Room, Barrel of a Gun, It's No Good, Home, Dream On, Freelove, Precious, Wrong and Heaven ;\n14 live / video collections (VHS/DVD/Blu-ray): The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg (1985), Some Great Videos (1985), Strange (1988), 101 (1989), Strange Too (1990), Devotional (1993), The Videos 86>98 (1998), One Night in Paris (2002), The Videos 86>98 (2002), Touring the Angel: Live in Milan (2006), The Best of - Volume 1 (2006), Tour of the Universe : Barcelona 20/21.11.09 (2009), Live in Berlin (2014) and Video Singles Collection (2016)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "A Broken Frame is the second studio album by the British synthpop band Depeche Mode, released in 1982. The album was written entirely by Martin Gore and recorded after the departure of Vince Clarke, who had left the band to form Yazoo with singer Alison Moyet. Alan Wilder was part of a second tour in the United Kingdom occurring prior to the release of this album, but he had not officially joined the band, and thus, does not appear on the album.\n\nIn the documentary that appears on the DVD that came with the 2006 reissue, Gore describes the record as \"our worst album\". None of the singles had long-term success compared to most of Depeche Mode's other albums' singles. A Broken Frame was the only album not represented on 101 and Remixes 81 - 04. Prior to 2006, the last song from the album to be performed live was \"Leave In Silence\" in 1986. \"Leave in Silence\" finally made its return (as an acoustic rendition) in a 2006 concert in Paris.\n\nThe song \"Monument\" was covered by GusGus for the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses.\n\nA special limited edition live album based on A Broken Frame recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on the 25th October 1982 was also released early in 1983 which also included a special 12\" version of Get The Balance Right on the B-Side.\n\n\n \n2006 re-release\nIn 2006, A Broken Frame was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the three B-sides \"Now This is Fun\", \"Oberkorn (It's a Small Town)\", and \"Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" in addition to several live versions of some of the songs from A Broken Frame.\n\nThe re-release preserves the album as it was originally intended. The bonus track \"Further Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" was removed (but unlike earlier re-releases wasn't put on the DVD as an extra) and the version of \"Leave In Silence\" is the album version, not the \"Longer\" version, making its debut in the USA. (Like \"Further Excerpts\", the \"Longer\" version doesn't appear on the DVD)\n\nThere are some omissions with the re-release, including a chord at the beginning of the stereo mixes of \"Satellite\" has disappeared and there are live versions of \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" and \"The Sun & The Rainfall\" listed on the DVD artwork that are not present on the disc itself.\n\nAlso included was a 27-minute documentary on A Broken Frame called Depeche Mode 1982 (The Beginning Of Their So-called Dark Phase) featuring interviews with Depeche Mode (including Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder) and other personnel such as Daniel Miller and cover-photographer Brian Griffin. There is also footage of television appearances and live performances.\n\nThe remastered album was released on \"deluxe\" vinyl in March 2007 in Germany, and internationally in April 2007.\n\n Track listing\n1982 release: Mute / Stumm 9 (UK)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun and the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \n 1982 release: Sire / 23751 (U.S.)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 6:28 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" – 4:20 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun & the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \nAll compositions by Martin Gore. \nDavid Gahan sings lead vocals on all songs except \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" which is a duet with Gore. \"Nothing to Fear\" and \"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" are instrumental. \n 2006 re-release\nMute: DM CD 2 (CD/SACD + DVD) / CDX STUMM 9 (CD/SACD)\n\nDisc 1 is a hybrid SACD/CD with a multi-channel SACD layer. \nDisc 2 is a DVD which includes A Broken Frame in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo plus bonus material \n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:43 (contains a slight edit, or error, at the beginning of the track on the redbook and stereo SACD layers.

      "wiki_content": "A Broken Frame is the second studio album by the British synthpop band Depeche Mode, released in 1982. The album was written entirely by Martin Gore and recorded after the departure of Vince Clarke, who had left the band to form Yazoo with singer Alison Moyet. Alan Wilder was part of a second tour in the United Kingdom occurring prior to the release of this album, but he had not officially joined the band, and thus, does not appear on the album.\n\nIn the documentary that appears on the DVD that came with the 2006 reissue, Gore describes the record as \"our worst album\". None of the singles had long-term success compared to most of Depeche Mode's other albums' singles. A Broken Frame was the only album not represented on 101 and Remixes 81 - 04. Prior to 2006, the last song from the album to be performed live was \"Leave In Silence\" in 1986. \"Leave in Silence\" finally made its return (as an acoustic rendition) in a 2006 concert in Paris.\n\nThe song \"Monument\" was covered by GusGus for the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses.\n\nA special limited edition live album based on A Broken Frame recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on the 25th October 1982 was also released early in 1983 which also included a special 12\" version of Get The Balance Right on the B-Side.\n\n\n \n2006 re-release\nIn 2006, A Broken Frame was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the three B-sides \"Now This is Fun\", \"Oberkorn (It's a Small Town)\", and \"Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" in addition to several live versions of some of the songs from A Broken Frame.\n\nThe re-release preserves the album as it was originally intended. The bonus track \"Further Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" was removed (but unlike earlier re-releases wasn't put on the DVD as an extra) and the version of \"Leave In Silence\" is the album version, not the \"Longer\" version, making its debut in the USA. (Like \"Further Excerpts\", the \"Longer\" version doesn't appear on the DVD)\n\nThere are some omissions with the re-release, including a chord at the beginning of the stereo mixes of \"Satellite\" has disappeared and there are live versions of \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" and \"The Sun & The Rainfall\" listed on the DVD artwork that are not present on the disc itself.\n\nAlso included was a 27-minute documentary on A Broken Frame called Depeche Mode 1982 (The Beginning Of Their So-called Dark Phase) featuring interviews with Depeche Mode (including Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder) and other personnel such as Daniel Miller and cover-photographer Brian Griffin. There is also footage of television appearances and live performances.\n\nThe remastered album was released on \"deluxe\" vinyl in March 2007 in Germany, and internationally in April 2007.\n\n Track listing\n1982 release: Mute / Stumm 9 (UK)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun and the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \n 1982 release: Sire / 23751 (U.S.)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 6:28 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" – 4:20 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun & the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \nAll compositions by Martin Gore. \nDavid Gahan sings lead vocals on all songs except \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" which is a duet with Gore. \"Nothing to Fear\" and \"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" are instrumental. \n 2006 re-release\nMute: DM CD 2 (CD/SACD + DVD) / CDX STUMM 9 (CD/SACD)\n\nDisc 1 is a hybrid SACD/CD with a multi-channel SACD layer. \nDisc 2 is a DVD which includes A Broken Frame in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo plus bonus material \n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:43 (contains a slight edit, or error, at the beginning of the track on the redbook and stereo SACD layers.
