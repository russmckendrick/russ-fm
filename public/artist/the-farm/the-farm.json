  "biography": "There are at least five artists which use this name\n1. An alternative rock band from the United Kingdom\n2. A blues/psychedelic rock band from South Pekin, Illinois\n3. A roots rock band from the United States\n4. A country trio from the United States\n5. A pre-punk band from Sussex, England\n\n1. The Farm are an alternative rock band which formed in Liverpool, England in 1984 and now continue to tour both as The Farm, and as part of The Justice Tonight band. Their album Spartacus stormed to number one in the UK albums chart when it was released in April 1991. The band are seen to be influenced by the Madchester movement, although they had existed for several years before the creation of the genre. The band split in 1996 and reunited in 2004\n\nwww.thefarmmusic.co.uk\n\n2. Farm is a blues/psychedelic rock band from South Pekin, Illinois. Their only LP is the self-titled Farm, released in 1971 and reissued in 2013. The sextet consists of Jim Elwyn (vocals, bass), Steve Evanchik (percussion, harmonica), Gary Gordon (vocals, guitar), Roger Greenwalt (keyboards), Del Herbert (guitar), and Mike Young (drums). \n\n3. Farm is a band from Enosburg Falls, Vermont that plays rootsy indie rock. They have self-released a double album called \"Gray Birds\".\n\n4. The Farm is an American country music trio consisting of Nick Hoffman (vocals, fiddle), Damien Horne (vocals, keyboard, guitar) and Krista Marie (vocals, guitar). Signed to All In Records in association with Elektra Records and New Revolution, the trio has released the single \"Home Sweet Home\", which has charted on Hot Country Songs. Horne is a former member of John Rich's songwriting group MuzikMafia, while Marie is a former solo artist for Broken Bow Records and Hoffman plays fiddle in Kenny Chesney's road band. The three met during a songwriting session which included former Western Flyer member Danny Myrick, who also became the group's producer.\n\n5. Not much is known about the band who appeared on the Spark label in 1974 called The Farm except that they did indeed live on a farm, in East Hoathley in Sussex - although the decidedly non-PC \"Fat Judy\" sounds as though they should have been living nearer to Canvey Island. The line-up consisted of vocalist Bob Brett, guitarists Norman Ley and Alan Davies, bassist Graham Thatcher and drummer Dick Gardiner.  - from the notes to \"Glitterbest\" CD compilation (Phil King) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Farm\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
