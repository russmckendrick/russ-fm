      "biography": "The Flaming Lips are an American rock band, formed in Norman, Oklahoma in 1983.\nInstrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles-such as \"What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical  by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the \"Big Bang\" That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe)\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die.\"\nThe group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with \"She Don't Use Jelly\". Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the \"Best International Act\" category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.",

The band used this point of entry for maximum effect, landing themselves on <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i> and securing a devoted following with outlandish three-dimensional live performances. <i>Transmissions</i>, with new guitarist Ronald Jones and drummer Steven Drozd, showcases the band’s strengths, from the whiplash rock hysteria of the opener “Turn It On” to the mock-field recording rusticity of “Chewin’ the Apple of Your Eye,” (which actually sounds like a long-lost ‘60s outtake recovered from a worn bootleg LP). The group’s svengali Wayne Coyne is at full capacity, singing like a demented street performer to best camouflage the shockingly bubble-gum melodies underpinning these fancily adorned studio recordings (“Be My Head”). This is what you call ‘head’ music for people who upon turning on and tuning in, don’t choose to drop out. But instead opt to engage further.",

The album marked the departure of Jonathan Donahue (to Mercury Rev) and Nathan Roberts, and the addition of guitarist Ronald Jones and drummer Steven Drozd. The EP Due to High Expectations...
