      "biography": "The Police was a rock band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- \"Outlandos d'Amour\" (1978), \"Reggatta de Blanc\" (1979), \"Zenyatta Mondatta\" (1980), \"Ghost in the Machine\" (1982) and \"Synchronicity\" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986\n\nThe band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. \n\nBiography \n\nThe Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.\n\nThe Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.\n\nThe Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and bass lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other \"white\" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of \"Babylon\", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like \"Roxanne\".\n\nTension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. \n\nIn 1992 the band released \"Message in a Box\", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.\n\nThe Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. \n\nSting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; \"Tea in the Sahara\" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .\n\nDiscography \n\n* Outlandos d'Amour (1978)\n* Reggatta de Blanc (1979)\n* Zenyatta Mondatta (1980)\n* Ghost in the Machine (1981)\n* Synchronicity (1983) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This was evident from the very first song on the album, “Don’t Stand So Close to Me”.\n\nThe tune starts with an ominous droning keyboard, incorporates dramatic dynamics and boasts a guitar synthesiser in the bridge played by Andy Summers. “Don’t Stand So Close to Me”, which later won a Grammy and reached No. 1 in the UK, also featured one of vocalist-bassist Sting’s most striking protagonists to date: a teacher full of guilt and shame for being in love with a student, much like the lead character in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel <i>Lolita</i>.\n\nAs with other Police albums, however, <i>Zenyatta Mondatta</i> was sonically eclectic, wrapping in a mix of instrumentals (“The Other Way of Stopping”) with quirky New Wave pop (“Canary in a Coalmine”, a clever song about someone living an anxious life) and reggae-influenced rock (“De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da”) with a dash of jazzy panache courtesy of drummer Stewart Copeland (“When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best of What’s Still Around”). The band’s weirdness was also present and accounted for; the instrumental “Behind My Camel” is as ominous as a horror movie interstitial, while “Shadows in the Rain” is murky dub.\n\nNigel Gray, who had recorded and engineered the band’s first two albums, 1978’s <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> and 1979’s <i>Reggatta de Blanc</i>, once again co-produced. That he knew the band so well was a boon: He pushed The Police to tease out their strengths—a dialled-in rhythm section, spring-loaded guitar riffs, Sting’s dynamic pop yelp—and refine these unique tendencies into a more cohesive, sophisticated album. <i>Zenyatta Mondatta</i> once again reached No. 1 in the UK and became the band’s first US Top 10 album, foreshadowing even greater things to come as the 1980s got rolling.",

            "content": "Zenyattà Mondatta is the third album by The Police, released in 1980.\n\nWritten during the band's second tour and recorded in just four weeks (minus several days for a short tour of the Netherlands). The band members have often expressed disappointment over it, going so far as to re-record two songs during a brief, unsuccessful reunion. Drummer Stewart Copeland, who contributed the songs \"Bombs Away\" and \"The Other Way of Stopping\", said about the time pressures:\n“ \tWe had bitten off more than we could chew. We finished the album at 4 a.m. on the day we were starting our next world tour... It was cutting it very fine. \t”\n\nNevertheless, Zenyattà Mondatta went to #5 in the U.S. and #1 in the UK and Australia, spurred by the success of the Sting-penned singles \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" and \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\". It would later receive glowing reviews from re-assessments in Rolling Stone and Q Magazine, among others, in spite of the fact that this is the least well-received of the five albums by The Police - so much so, it was the only of their five albums not to obtain a spot on the Rolling Stone's list 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAs alluded to by Copeland, the Police embarked on a tour of the world the day of the album's completion, beginning in Belgium and reaching places such as India and Egypt.\n\nThe album itself is the last of the Police's early era, influenced by reggae and punk and featuring few musical elements on top of the core guitar, bass, and drums. Perhaps due to the lack of time for writing lyrics, the record has two instrumentals, \"The Other Way of Stopping\", and the Grammy-winning \"Behind My Camel\" (a third song, \"Voices Inside My Head\", is mostly an instrumental except for the words \"Voices inside my head/ Echoes of things that you said\", which are repeated a couple of times in the middle of the song). \"Behind My Camel\" was guitarist Andy Summers' first entirely self-penned composition, and it was not popular with the other members of the band. According to Sting, \"I hated that song so much that, one day when I was in the studio, I found the tape lying on the table. So I took it around the back of the studio and actually buried it in the garden.\" Allegedly, Sting was so uninterested in the piece that he refused to play it. Andy Summers managed to coax Stewart Copeland into recording the bit as a duo, and then overdubbed the bass line himself.\n\nZenyattà Mondatta is also notable for containing the band's first lyrics ever referring to political events, with Sting's \"Driven To Tears\" commenting on poverty and Copeland's \"Bombs Away\" referring to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. These themes would become more prevalent in the Police's next album, Ghost in the Machine.\n\nZenyattà Mondatta has been translated as Sanskrit for \"Top of the World\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Zenyatta+Mondatta\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Zenyattà Mondatta is the third album by The Police, released in 1980.\n\nWritten during the band's second tour and recorded in just four weeks (minus several days for a short tour of the Netherlands). The band members have often expressed disappointment over it, going so far as to re-record two songs during a brief, unsuccessful reunion. Drummer Stewart Copeland, who contributed the songs \"Bombs Away\" and \"The Other Way of Stopping\", said about the time pressures:\n“ \tWe had bitten off more than we could chew. We finished the album at 4 a.m. on the day we were starting our next world tour... It was cutting it very fine. \t”\n\nNevertheless, Zenyattà Mondatta went to #5 in the U.S. and #1 in the UK and Australia, spurred by the success of the Sting-penned singles \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" and \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\". It would later receive glowing reviews from re-assessments in Rolling Stone and Q Magazine, among others, in spite of the fact that this is the least well-received of the five albums by The Police - so much so, it was the only of their five albums not to obtain a spot on the Rolling Stone's list 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAs alluded to by Copeland, the Police embarked on a tour of the world the day of the album's completion, beginning in Belgium and reaching places such as India and Egypt.\n\nThe album itself is the last of the Police's early era, influenced by reggae and punk and featuring few musical elements on top of the core guitar, bass, and drums. Perhaps due to the lack of time for writing lyrics, the record has two instrumentals, \"The Other Way of Stopping\", and the Grammy-winning \"Behind My Camel\" (a third song, \"Voices Inside My Head\", is mostly an instrumental except for the words \"Voices inside my head/ Echoes of things that you said\", which are repeated a couple of times in the middle of the song). \"Behind My Camel\" was guitarist Andy Summers' first entirely self-penned composition, and it was not popular with the other members of the band. According to Sting, \"I hated that song so much that, one day when I was in the studio, I found the tape lying on the table. So I took it around the back of the studio and actually buried it in the garden.\" Allegedly, Sting was so uninterested in the piece that he refused to play it. Andy Summers managed to coax Stewart Copeland into recording the bit as a duo, and then overdubbed the bass line himself.\n\nZenyattà Mondatta is also notable for containing the band's first lyrics ever referring to political events, with Sting's \"Driven To Tears\" commenting on poverty and Copeland's \"Bombs Away\" referring to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. These themes would become more prevalent in the Police's next album, Ghost in the Machine.\n\nZenyattà Mondatta has been translated as Sanskrit for \"Top of the World\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Zenyatta+Mondatta\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
