  "biography": "Coheed and Cambria is an American progressive rock band from Nyack, New York. Formed in 2001, the group incorporates aspects of progressive metal, punk rock, metal, post-hardcore, emo-pop, pop punk and alternative rock. The band currently consists of Claudio Sanchez (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Travis Stever (guitars, vocals), Josh Eppard (drums, keyboards, backing vocals), and Zach Cooper (bass, backing vocals). Most of Coheed and Cambria's albums are concept albums based on a science fiction storyline called The Amory Wars, a series written by Claudio Sanchez, which has been transcribed into a series of comic books as well as a full-length novel. The band has released nine studio albums, three live albums, and several special-edition releases. Their most recent releases, the Vaxis  saga, is a return to The Amory Wars concept following 2015's The Color Before the Sun, the band's first non-conceptual album since their inception. The Color Before the Sun, The Afterman: Descension, Year of the Black Rainbow and Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness all reached the Billboard top 10. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coheed+and+Cambria\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
