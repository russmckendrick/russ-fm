      "biography": "The B-52s are an American rock band, formed in Athens, Georgia in 1976. The original line-up consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals, cowbell), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards), Cindy Wilson (vocals, tambourine, bongos), Ricky Wilson (guitar), and Keith Strickland (drums). Following Ricky Wilson's death in 1985 Strickland switched to guitar. Then they added Tracy Wormworth (bass), Sterling Campbell (drums) and Paul Gordon (keyboards).\n\nRooted in New Wave and 1960s rock and roll, the group later covered many genres ranging from post-punk to pop rock. The \"guy vs. gals\" vocals of Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson, sometimes used in call and response style (\"Strobe Light,\" \"Private Idaho\", and \"Good Stuff\"), are a trademark. Presenting themselves as a positive, enthusiastic, slightly oddball party band, the B-52s tell tall tales, glorify wild youth, and celebrate wild romance. The band name had long been \"The B-52's\", until 2008 when they dropped the apostrophe and are now \"The B-52s\"",

But the band’s commercial success only accounts for part of their story. It’s not even like they changed that much: Go back and listen to “52 Girls” or “Rock Lobster” from the group’s self-titled 1979 debut, and you can hear the same stuff that made the band so big a little later on: the surf guitars, the kitschy sense of humour, the way they flipped the innocence of 1950s pop culture into something trashy and a little weird. Even the band’s name—The B-52’s, after the ridiculous, precarious, over-feminised beehive haircuts worn by Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson, but also after the conical noses of the bomber planes the haircuts resembled—felt subversive, or at least a little pokey; a connection between the insane cheerfulness of postwar pop and the almost monolithic violence of the American state. Getting lumped in with punk rock wasn’t totally wrong: As fun as it is, <i>The B-52’s</i> is shiny plastic music that makes you think about the rot underneath. And if that sounds highfalutin, just listen to how ugly they scream on “Dance This Mess Around” or Petula Clark’s “Downtown”—this isn’t a sock hop, sport.\n\nAlongside albums like the Talking Heads’ <i>More Songs About Buildings and Food</i> and Devo’s <i>Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!</i>, this album defined the sound and feel of American New Wave: arty, direct, nerdy and questioning and a little irreverent but friendly, too—at least compared to the Romantic destruction of punk. And as current as the music probably sounded in the late 1970s, <i>The B-52’s</i> also predicted the playfulness of junk and retro culture that became a fixture of pop from the 1990s on, in which the present was basically a weirdly stitched-together Frankenstein of a bunch of disposable pasts. That Fred Schneider and Ricky Wilson—who died of AIDS in 1985—were two of the more identifiable gay pop artists of the time only made the band seem more novel and urgent. You know what they say: One man’s trash is another group of visionary weirdos’ treasure.",
