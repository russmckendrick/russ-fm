  "biography": "It all started in 1968 when Chris Curtis, an ex-Searcher, formed a group withDave Curtiss (no relation, note different spelling) on bass, Bobby Woodman-Clarke on drums and brought in ex-Artwoods organist Jon Lord (born 9 June 1941, Leicester, England) and ex-Johnny Kidd andThe Pirates bassist, Nick Simper (born 3 November 1946, Southall, Middlesex).Nick had survived the car crash that had killed Johnny Kidd in 1966. GuitaristRitchie Blackmore (born 14 April 1945, Weston-super-Mare, England) joined inrehearsals for this new act initially dubbed Roundabout. Curtis dropped outwithin days, and when Dave and Bobby also proved incompatible, two members ofMaze, Rod Evans (born 19 January 1945, Edinburgh, Scotland; vocals) and IanPaice (born 29 June 1948, Nottinghamshire; drums), replaced them.\n\nHaving adopted the Deep Purple name (apparently inspired by Ritchie'sgrandmother's favorite song) following a brief Scandinavian tour in April 1968(where they played as Roundabout, \"in case they flopped\"), the quintetbegan recording their debut album, which they patterned on USA group VanillaFudge. \"Shades of Deep Purple\" thus included dramatic rearrangementsof well-known songs, including a faithful cover of Hendrix's version of\"Hey Joe\" and the Joe South-penned, Billy Joe Royal hit\"Hush\", the latter hitting US #4 in 1968 but not troubling the UKchart-compilers one bit.\n\nLengthy tours ensued as the group, all but ignored at home, steadfastly courtedthe burgeoning American concert circuit. \"The Book Of Taliesyn\" and\"Deep Purple\" albums also featured several excellent reworkings,notably \"Kentucky Woman\" (Neil Diamond) and \"River Deep MountainHigh\" (Ike And Tina Turner). The lengthy intro section to \"RiverDeep\" was a dramatic work-out of the theme from the then recently releasedStanley Kubrick sci-fi classic film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Thispiece was based on Richard Strauss' \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" and JonLord's classical leanings would soon culminate in a self-composed full-lengthwork performed at the  Royal Albert Hall in September 1969.\n\nThe band also drew acclaim for their original material and the dramaticinterplay between Lord and Blackmore. In concert these guitar/organ duels couldgo on for over 20 minutes!\n\nIn July 1969 both Evans and Simper were axed from the line-up, which was thenbuoyed by the arrival of Ian Gillan (born 19 August 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex,England; vocals) and Roger Glover (born 30 November 1945, Brecon, Wales; bass)from the pop group Episode Six. Acknowledged by aficionados as the\"classic\" Deep Purple line-up (forever onwards known as Mark II), thereshaped quintet made its album debut on the grandiose \"Concerto For GroupAnd Orchestra\", scored by Lord and recorded with the Royal PhilharmonicOrchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold (later sir Malcolm).\n\nIts hard rock successor, \"In Rock\", established the group as aleading heavy metal attraction and introduced such enduring favorites as\"Speed King\" and \"Child In Time.\" Gillan's powerfulsilver-throated vocals brought a third dimension to their sound and thisnew-found popularity in the UK was enhanced when the single, \"BlackNight\" reached number 2. \"Strange Kind Of Woman\" followed itinto the Top 10 (reaching #8 in Feb 1971), while \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\" both toppedthe album charts. The latter included the riff-laden \"Smoke On TheWater\", based on a real incident involving Frank Zappa and The Mothersand  an infamous Montreaux concert.\n\nAlthough the platinum-selling \"Made In Japan\" captured their liveprowess in full flight, relations within the band grew increasingly strained,and \"Who Do We Think We Are!\" would be the end of this highlysuccessful line-up.  The departures of Gillan and Glover robbed DeepPurple of an expressive frontman and imaginative arranger, although DavidCoverdale (born 22 September 1949, Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Lancashire, England;vocals) and Glenn Hughes (born 21 August 1952, Penkridge, Staffordshire;ex-Trapeze, bass & vocals) brought a new impetus to the act.\"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" both reached the Top 10, butBlackmore grew increasingly dissatisfied with the group's direction and in May1975 left to form Rainbow. US guitarist Tommy Bolin (born 18 April 1951, SiouxCity, Idaho), formerly of the James Gang and who had impressed Coverdale withhis playing on Billy Cobham's \"Spectrum\", joined Deep Purple for\"Come Taste The Band\", but his jazz/soul style was incompatible withthe group's heavy metal sound, and a now-tiring act folded in 1976 following afarewell UK tour.\n\nBolin died of a heroin overdose within months of Purple's demise. Judiciousarchives and 'best of' releases kept the group in the public eye, as did thehigh profile enjoyed by its several ex-members. Successful off-shoot bandsinclude Whitesnake, Rainbow and Gillan. Pressure for a reunion bore fruit in1984 when Gillan, Lord, Blackmore, Glover and Paice (the original Mark II)completed \"Perfect Strangers\". A whole new generation of fansdiscovered Deep Purple through this  release and subsequent US, Japaneseand European tour. A second album, \"The House Of Blue Light\",followed, but recurring animosity between Gillan and Blackmore resulted in thesinger's departure following the disappointing live album \"Nobody'sPerfect\" which included a 1988 rehearsal re-working of their first hit\"Hush\".\n\nJoe Lynn Turner, one of Blackmore's many Rainbow vocalists, joined and gave theband more of an AOR (Adult-Orientated Rock) direction. After a disappointingSlaves & Masters album released in 1990 (though Fire In The Basement isclassic 70s Purple), better sense prevailed. Gillan was re-admitted for histhird stint, uncomfortably sharing stage and studio with Blackmore. The line-upremained stable while the band recorded \"The Battle Rages On\" albumreleased in 1993, but Blackmore jumped ship once more during the tour thatfollowed. The tour was completed courtesy of US guitar whizzkid Joe Satriani.Contractual obligations however, meant his tenure could only be short-term andPurple hurriedly enlisted Steve Morse (ex-Kansas, Dixie Dregs, The Steve MorseBand, et al) (born 28 July 1954, Hamilton, Ohio) as his replacement to recordPurpendicular released early in 1996.\n\nSetting off on tour again, they took a fresh look at their 70s repertoire; tourhighlights were captured on the \"Live at the Olympia\" CD (1997) with forgottenfavorites jostling for position against new material from the \"Purpendicular\"set. Suddenly they felt they could have fun again, and the concerts wereenlivened by dropping old faves like \"Lazy\" and \"SpaceTruckin'\" in favour of new material and songs from the back catalogue thathad seldom if ever been played (such as \"Bloodsucker\", \"No OneCame\" and \"Rat Bat Blue\").\n\n1998's \"Abandon\" album had all the classic rock attitude, nasty guitars, poundingdrums and driving bass to scratch that R.O.C.K. itch. The album included abrilliant reworking of \"In Rock\"'s \"Bloodsucker\" (retitled\"Bludsucker\") and the Floydish-style \"Watching The Sky\"amongst other driving rock tracks.\n\nIn 1999 Deep Purple had a very successful tour of Australia and Europe. \n\nJon Lord retired in 2002 and was replaced by journeyman keyboardist Don Airey. This new line-up, which left Ian Paice as the only original member, released the stunning \"Bananas\" album in August 2003. Both a return-to-form and a look to the future, the \"Bananas\" album was well-accepted by the rock community at large.\n\nIn 2012 Deep Purple will record and release a new album.",

      "biography_de": "\"Wir gingen nach Montreux ans Ufer des Genfer Sees ... hatten aber nicht viel Zeit\", erzählen Deep Purple zu Beginn ihres bekanntesten Songs. Erst belegt Frank Zappa das Casino, in dem sie aufnehmen sollen, dann fällt es auch noch einem Brand zum Opfer. Mit dem ausgeliehenen mobilen Soundequipment der Rolling Stones nehmen sie das Album \"Machinehead\" kurzerhand im Keller ihres Hotels auf. Dabei entsteht ein Track über die Erlebnisse in der Schweiz: \"Smoke On The Water\".\n\nDamit schaffen Deep Purple die bekannteste Hardrock-Hymne neben Black Sabbaths \"Paranoid\" und Led Zeppelins \"Stairway To Heaven\". Die drei Bands gelten als Gründer des Genres und kommen oft im gleichen Satz vor. Von vergleichsweise härteren Tönen abgesehen, haben Deep Purple jedoch wenig mit den anderen zwei gemeinsam. Einerseits, weil ihre Musik eher in der Klassik als im Blues wurzelt, andererseits, weil die Orgel wesentlicher Bestandteil ihrer Stücke ist.\n\nHinzu kommt ein ständiger Mitgliederwechsel. Die Gründer Jon Lord (Orgel), Ritchie Blackmore (Gitarre), Ian Paice (Schlagzeug), Nick Simper (Bass) und Rod Evans (Gesang) finden 1968 in England zusammen. Alle haben schon Band-Erfahrung, der Name stammt scheinbar aus dem Lieblingslied von Blackmores Oma.\n\nDen ersten Erfolg feiern sie mit dem Debütalbum \"Shades Of Deep Purple\": Ihre Coverversion von \"Hush\" erreicht Position fünf in den US-Singlecharts. Aber erst mit \"April\" aus ihrem dritten Album \"Deep Purple\" (1969) setzen sie die Weichen für ihre Zukunft. Das Stück gründet auf T.S. Eliots Poem \"The Waste Land\" und enthält lange Improvisationen von Lord und Blackmore.\n\nMit ihrer Kombination aus druckvollen harten Klängen und bis dahin in der Rockmusik unüblichen Tonleitern machen sie sich auch live einen Namen. Vor allem Lord entwickelt die Verbindung zwischen Rock und Klassik weiter. Die Erstaufführung seines \"Concerto For Group And Orchestra\" mit dem London Philharmonic Orchestra\" in der Royal Albert Hall 1969 begründet nicht nur ein neues Genre. Es ist auch der erste Auftritt ders bekanntesten Purple-Line-Ups, in dem Ian Gillan Evans und Roger Glover Simper ersetzen.\n\nDie folgenden drei Studioalben verschaffen den weltweiten Durchbruch. \"Fireball\" und \"Machine Head\" erreichen die Spitze der englischen Charts, mit \"Child In Time\", \"Highway Star\", \"Speed King\" und \"Smoke On The Water\" enthalten sie zudem die besten Stücke der Band in ihrer kreativ fruchtbarsten Phase. Davon zeugt das 72er Livealbum \"Made In Japan\", in dem die Zusammenarbeit zwischen der kräftigen Stimme Gillans, der Rhythmusgruppe Paice und Glover sowie den Virtuosen Lord und Blackmore ihren Höhepunkt erreicht.\n\n1973 ist das als \"Mark II\" bekannte Line-Up am Ende. Gillan und der immer egozentrischere Blackmore können sich nicht mehr riechen. Nach Gillans Auftritt in der Verfilmung von Andrew Lloyd Webbers Musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" und der eher schwachen LP \"Who Do We Think We Are\" werfen Glover und Gillan das Handtuch. An ihre Stelle treten Glenn Hughes und der spätere Whitesnake-Frontmann David Coverdale.\n\n\"Burn\" und \"Stormbringer\" (beide 1974) schaffen es in die Top Ten. Anschließend steigt Blackmore aus, um Rainbow zu gründen. Der neue Gitarrist Tommy Bolin schafft es in keinster Weise, seinen charismatischen Vorgänger zu ersetzen. Deep Purple lösen sich nach dem enttäuschenden \"Come Taste The Band\" (1975) auf. Wenige Monate später stirbt Bolin an einer Überdosis.\n\nNach mehr oder weniger erfolgreichen Nebentätigkeiten - Lord und Paice heuern zeitweise bei Whitesnake an, Gillan singt auf einem Black Sabbath-Album, veröffentlicht unter seinem eigenen Namen einige Platten, Blackmore festigt mit Rainbow seinen Kultstatus - finden die \"Mark II\"-Mitglieder 1984 überraschend wieder zusammen.\n\nDas Ergebnis sind nicht nur das gelungene Studioalbum \"Perfect Strangers\" (1984) und der Nachfolger \"The House Of Blue Light\" (1987), sondern auch eine ausgiebige Welttour, die auf \"Nobody's Perfect\" (1988) dokumentiert ist. Gillan und Blackmore kommen sich unvermeidlich erneut in die Quere und wieder ist es der Sänger, der den Hut nimmt. Mit dem ehemaligen Rainbow-Frontmann Joe Lynn Turner und dem 1990er Album \"Slaves & Masters\" beginnen anschließend sechs chaotische Jahre.\n\nFür die Studioplatte mit dem autobiografischen Titel \"The Battle Rages On ...\" (1993) kommt Gillan erneut ins Boot, springt aber kurz danach wieder ab. Dann ist es Blackmore, der mitten in der Welttour im Streit austritt, vorläufig ersetzt durch Joe Satriani. Dafür kehrt Gillan zurück. Auf dem '96er \"Purpendicular\" heißt der neue Mann schließlich Steve Morse, ehemaliger Gitarrist von Kansas.\n\nMit dieser Besetzung bringen Deep Purple auch \"Abandon\" (1998) heraus, touren anschließend jahrelang um die Welt und sind sich dabei nicht zu schade, auf kleineren Festivals oder in der Provinz aufzutreten. Blackmore sucht dagegen mit seiner Muse Candice Night unter dem Namen Blackmore's Night kostümiert mittelalterliche Schlosskeller auf und gibt erfolgreich Pseudo-Renaissancemusik zum Besten.\n\nNach einer Neuaufführung des \"Concerto For Group And Orchestra\" im Jahr 2000 beschließt Lord, sich seiner alten Liebe zu widmen, und steigt aus. Der Ersatzmann in der mittlerweile \"Mark VIII\"-Besetzung ist Keyboarder Don Airey, der schon für Rainbow, Gary Moore und Ozzy Osbourne gespielt hat. Trotz ihres vollgepackten Tourkalenders schaffen es Deep Purple auch immer wieder ins Studio. Auf \"Bananas\" (2003), \"Rapture Of The Deep\" (2005) folgt \"Now What?!\" (2013), das von 0 auf 1 in die deutschen Charts einsteigt.\n\nSo ist die Band weiterhin aktiv, ohne noch etwas grandios Neues zu erfinden oder überraschende Glanztaten zu vollbringen. Das haben gesetzte Herren, die für die Musikhistorie ohnehin genug beigetragen haben, auch nicht mehr wirklich nötig. Sie musizieren um des Musizierens willen.\n\nDas tut auch Lord nach seinem Abgang. 2007 steht er der australischen Band The Hoochie Coochie Men auf dem gelungenen Album \"Danger: White Men Dancing\" zur Seite, Anfang 2012 werkelt er mit den alten Purple-Kollegen Gillan und Blackmore am Charity-Projekt Who Cares mit. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt leidet Lord bereits an jenem Bauchspeicheldrüsenkrebs, an dem er am 16. Juli 2012 in London im Kreise seiner Angehörigen stirbt.",
      "biography_en": "It all started in 1968 when Chris Curtis, an ex-Searcher, formed a group withDave Curtiss (no relation, note different spelling) on bass, Bobby Woodman-Clarke on drums and brought in ex-Artwoods organist Jon Lord (born 9 June 1941, Leicester, England) and ex-Johnny Kidd andThe Pirates bassist, Nick Simper (born 3 November 1946, Southall, Middlesex).Nick had survived the car crash that had killed Johnny Kidd in 1966. GuitaristRitchie Blackmore (born 14 April 1945, Weston-super-Mare, England) joined inrehearsals for this new act initially dubbed Roundabout. Curtis dropped outwithin days, and when Dave and Bobby also proved incompatible, two members ofMaze, Rod Evans (born 19 January 1945, Edinburgh, Scotland; vocals) and IanPaice (born 29 June 1948, Nottinghamshire; drums), replaced them.\n\nHaving adopted the Deep Purple name (apparently inspired by Ritchie'sgrandmother's favorite song) following a brief Scandinavian tour in April 1968(where they played as Roundabout, \"in case they flopped\"), the quintetbegan recording their debut album, which they patterned on USA group VanillaFudge. \"Shades of Deep Purple\" thus included dramatic rearrangementsof well-known songs, including a faithful cover of Hendrix's version of\"Hey Joe\" and the Joe South-penned, Billy Joe Royal hit\"Hush\", the latter hitting US #4 in 1968 but not troubling the UKchart-compilers one bit.\n\nLengthy tours ensued as the group, all but ignored at home, steadfastly courtedthe burgeoning American concert circuit. \"The Book Of Taliesyn\" and\"Deep Purple\" albums also featured several excellent reworkings,notably \"Kentucky Woman\" (Neil Diamond) and \"River Deep MountainHigh\" (Ike And Tina Turner). The lengthy intro section to \"RiverDeep\" was a dramatic work-out of the theme from the then recently releasedStanley Kubrick sci-fi classic film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Thispiece was based on Richard Strauss' \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" and JonLord's classical leanings would soon culminate in a self-composed full-lengthwork performed at the  Royal Albert Hall in September 1969.\n\nThe band also drew acclaim for their original material and the dramaticinterplay between Lord and Blackmore. In concert these guitar/organ duels couldgo on for over 20 minutes!\n\nIn July 1969 both Evans and Simper were axed from the line-up, which was thenbuoyed by the arrival of Ian Gillan (born 19 August 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex,England; vocals) and Roger Glover (born 30 November 1945, Brecon, Wales; bass)from the pop group Episode Six. Acknowledged by aficionados as the\"classic\" Deep Purple line-up (forever onwards known as Mark II), thereshaped quintet made its album debut on the grandiose \"Concerto For GroupAnd Orchestra\", scored by Lord and recorded with the Royal PhilharmonicOrchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold (later sir Malcolm).\n\nIts hard rock successor, \"In Rock\", established the group as aleading heavy metal attraction and introduced such enduring favorites as\"Speed King\" and \"Child In Time.\" Gillan's powerfulsilver-throated vocals brought a third dimension to their sound and thisnew-found popularity in the UK was enhanced when the single, \"BlackNight\" reached number 2. \"Strange Kind Of Woman\" followed itinto the Top 10 (reaching #8 in Feb 1971), while \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\" both toppedthe album charts. The latter included the riff-laden \"Smoke On TheWater\", based on a real incident involving Frank Zappa and The Mothersand  an infamous Montreaux concert.\n\nAlthough the platinum-selling \"Made In Japan\" captured their liveprowess in full flight, relations within the band grew increasingly strained,and \"Who Do We Think We Are!\" would be the end of this highlysuccessful line-up.  The departures of Gillan and Glover robbed DeepPurple of an expressive frontman and imaginative arranger, although DavidCoverdale (born 22 September 1949, Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Lancashire, England;vocals) and Glenn Hughes (born 21 August 1952, Penkridge, Staffordshire;ex-Trapeze, bass & vocals) brought a new impetus to the act.\"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" both reached the Top 10, butBlackmore grew increasingly dissatisfied with the group's direction and in May1975 left to form Rainbow. US guitarist Tommy Bolin (born 18 April 1951, SiouxCity, Idaho), formerly of the James Gang and who had impressed Coverdale withhis playing on Billy Cobham's \"Spectrum\", joined Deep Purple for\"Come Taste The Band\", but his jazz/soul style was incompatible withthe group's heavy metal sound, and a now-tiring act folded in 1976 following afarewell UK tour.\n\nBolin died of a heroin overdose within months of Purple's demise. Judiciousarchives and 'best of' releases kept the group in the public eye, as did thehigh profile enjoyed by its several ex-members. Successful off-shoot bandsinclude Whitesnake, Rainbow and Gillan. Pressure for a reunion bore fruit in1984 when Gillan, Lord, Blackmore, Glover and Paice (the original Mark II)completed \"Perfect Strangers\". A whole new generation of fansdiscovered Deep Purple through this  release and subsequent US, Japaneseand European tour. A second album, \"The House Of Blue Light\",followed, but recurring animosity between Gillan and Blackmore resulted in thesinger's departure following the disappointing live album \"Nobody'sPerfect\" which included a 1988 rehearsal re-working of their first hit\"Hush\".\n\nJoe Lynn Turner, one of Blackmore's many Rainbow vocalists, joined and gave theband more of an AOR (Adult-Orientated Rock) direction. After a disappointingSlaves & Masters album released in 1990 (though Fire In The Basement isclassic 70s Purple), better sense prevailed. Gillan was re-admitted for histhird stint, uncomfortably sharing stage and studio with Blackmore. The line-upremained stable while the band recorded \"The Battle Rages On\" albumreleased in 1993, but Blackmore jumped ship once more during the tour thatfollowed. The tour was completed courtesy of US guitar whizzkid Joe Satriani.Contractual obligations however, meant his tenure could only be short-term andPurple hurriedly enlisted Steve Morse (ex-Kansas, Dixie Dregs, The Steve MorseBand, et al) (born 28 July 1954, Hamilton, Ohio) as his replacement to recordPurpendicular released early in 1996.\n\nSetting off on tour again, they took a fresh look at their 70s repertoire; tourhighlights were captured on the \"Live at the Olympia\" CD (1997) with forgottenfavorites jostling for position against new material from the \"Purpendicular\"set. Suddenly they felt they could have fun again, and the concerts wereenlivened by dropping old faves like \"Lazy\" and \"SpaceTruckin'\" in favour of new material and songs from the back catalogue thathad seldom if ever been played (such as \"Bloodsucker\", \"No OneCame\" and \"Rat Bat Blue\").\n\n1998's \"Abandon\" album had all the classic rock attitude, nasty guitars, poundingdrums and driving bass to scratch that R.O.C.K. itch. The album included abrilliant reworking of \"In Rock\"'s \"Bloodsucker\" (retitled\"Bludsucker\") and the Floydish-style \"Watching The Sky\"amongst other driving rock tracks.\n\nIn 1999 Deep Purple had a very successful tour of Australia and Europe. \n\nJon Lord retired in 2002 and was replaced by journeyman keyboardist Don Airey. This new line-up, which left Ian Paice as the only original member, released the stunning \"Bananas\" album in August 2003. Both a return-to-form and a look to the future, the \"Bananas\" album was well-accepted by the rock community at large.\n\nIn 2012 Deep Purple will record and release a new album.",

Deep Purple ha vendido más de 120 millones de discos en todo el mundo.

      "biography_fr": "Deep Purple est un groupe de rock britannique fondé en 1968, considéré comme l'un des fondateurs du genre hard rock avec Led Zeppelin et Black Sabbath. Au cours de ses quarante ans d'existence, le groupe a toujours été constitué de cinq musiciens (un chanteur, un guitariste, un bassiste, un batteur, un organiste) mais a connu plusieurs changements de membres qui ont déterminé son évolution musicale. Les éléments caractéristiques du son de Deep Purple durant la majeure partie de son existence sont la guitare Fender Stratocaster de Ritchie Blackmore et l'orgue Hammond de Jon Lord.\n\nDurant ses deux années d'existence, le quintette original enregistre trois albums influencés par le psychédélisme de Vanilla Fudge et Jimi Hendrix. L'arrivée en 1969 du chanteur Ian Gillan et du bassiste Roger Glover donne lieu à la période la plus faste du groupe, avec les albums In Rock, Machine Head (avec le tube Smoke on the Water) et l'enregistrement en public Made in Japan. Après le départ de Gillan et Glover en 1973, leurs remplaçants David Coverdale et Glenn Hughes orientent la musique du groupe dans une direction soul et funk, et l'arrivée du guitariste Tommy Bolin en 1975 ne fait que renforcer cette évolution. Le groupe se sépare l'année suivante.\n\nLa formation emblématique du début des années 1970 se reforme en 1984, mais sa composition fluctue durant les dix années qui suivent, qui sont marquées par les tensions entre Ian Gillan et Ritchie Blackmore : le premier quitte de nouveau le groupe de 1989 à 1992, alors que le second en claque définitivement la porte en 1993.

Insieme a gruppi come Led Zeppelin e Black Sabbath, sono considerati fra i principali pionieri del genere heavy metal.[4][7]\nSi possono considerare i Deep Purple come una delle band musicalmente più complete degli anni settanta, con un sostrato musicale che spazia dal blues al Rock and roll, dal funky al jazz e al folk, dalla musica orientale alla musica classica fino al R&B. Ai Deep Purple va attribuita la prima commistione tra umori e temi musicali neoclassici al tempo e al ritmo tipici del blues e del rock and roll.[senza fonte] Il suono della band comprende anche elementi di rock progressivo e ciò li ha resi una band unica nell'hard rock e nell'heavy metal, visto che nessun altro gruppo rock è riuscito ad avere così tante influenze neoclassiche ed elementi di rock progressivo.\nHanno venduto più di 100 milioni di copie nel mondo[8][9] senza contare le enormi vendite di bootleg, cioè il traffico di dischi illegale spesso registrati nei live del gruppo, sempre formidabili, e sono stati presenti sul Guinness dei primati come la band più rumorosa del mondo.[10]\nA differenza di molti gruppi coetanei, nati dall'incontro di musicisti, i Deep Purple nacquero principalmente per la volontà di due manager: John Coletta e Tony Edwards.",

      "biography_nl": "Jon Lord startte in 1968 met een band onder de naam \"Roundabout\" met gitarist Ritchie Blackmore, maar veel succes had hij niet en al snel vertrokken de drummer en de bassist. Via twee mensen die manager van de groep wilden worden kreeg hij Nick Simper als bassist en Ian Paice als drummer. Rod Evans sloot zich bij de groep aan als zanger.\n\nDe groep wijzigde haar naam in Deep Purple, en nam een eerste single op: \"Hush\". Dit was meteen de eerste hit. De single werd gevolgd door een cover van \"Kentucky Woman\" van Neil Diamond, waarna de eerste lp volgde: Shades Of Deep Purple. De plaat was matig succesvol. De band besloot daarom zo snel mogelijk de volgende plaat, The Book of Taliesyn, uit te brengen. Deze lp had wel succes, en de weg voor Deep Purple lag open. De samenstelling van de groep was Ritchie Blackmore op gitaar, Rod Evans zang, Jon Lord op de keyboards, Ian Paice op de drum en Nick Simper op bas. In deze samenstelling werd een titelloos album uitgebracht, waarop Deep Purple voor het eerst samenwerkte met een orkest in April. In hetzelfde jaar schreef Jon Lord Concerto For Group and Orchestra, waarop de band samenwerkte met de Royal Philarmonic Orchestra onder leiding van Malcolm Arnold. Op het album zijn Gillan en Glover voor het eerst te beluisteren.\n\nMet het overkomen van Roger Glover en Ian Gillan van Episode Six naar Deep Purple slaat de groep een andere weg in. Het succes komt met het album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple zette hiermee haar naam als hardrockgroep en was met groepen als Led Zeppelin en Black Sabbath een van de pioniers van deze stijl. Black Night werd een hit in Nederland, maar kwam niet op het album te staan. Na In Rock volgde Fireball, waarvan de verkoopcijfers enigszins tegenvielen. In de VS komt de klassieker Strange Kind of Woman op het album te staan in plaats van Demon's Eye. Het titelnummer Fireball verscheen op single. Groter succes komt er als Child In Time (verdeeld over twee singlekanten) op single verschijnt in de Benelux. Het nummer zou later zeven jaar op nummer 1 staan in Veronica's Top 100 aller tijden. Het volgende album, Machine Head, wordt zowel artistiek als commercieel een groot succes. In de VS is de groep een mega-act geworden en Smoke on the Water is vaker op de Amerikaanse radio te horen dan het volkslied. Veel tracks van dit album komen in hetzelfde jaar op het dubbellivealbum Made in Japan. De samenstelling van de groep op deze albums was Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord en Ian Paice (MK2). In 1973 verscheen voorlopig het laatste album in deze bezetting met Who Do We Think We Are. Woman From Tokyo wordt wereldwijd op single gezet. Japan kiest voor een liveversie van Black Night als A-kant.\n\nNadien werden Ian Gillan en Roger Glover vervangen door David Coverdale en bassist Glenn Hughes die allebei de lead-vocals voor hun rekening nemen. In deze bezetting verschijnt het album Burn. De songs evolueerden weg van de heavy rock en invloeden uit de blues en de soul vonden hun weg. Uiteindelijk verliet Ritchie Blackmore de band waarna Tommy Bolin (ex-The James Gang) zijn plaats in nam. Na enkele live-miskleunen en een knappe Bolin-gesigneerde lp Come taste the Band legde Purple er tijdelijk de bijl bij neer. Bolin maakte, na het sublieme Teaser, nog een tweede LP met zijn eigen Bolin-band en overleed kort daarna aan een overdosis drugs op het moment dat hij met zijn eigen band het voorprogramma ging verzorgen voor Jeff Beck.\n\nVan de originele leden, Nick Simper en Rod Evans, bracht alleen Simper op een Duits label nog twee albums uit. Alle andere Purple-leden bouwden een vrij succesvolle carrière uit, maar het succes van Deep Purple wist niemand te evenaren.\n\nn 1980 vormde Rod Evans met enkele andere muzikanten een nieuwe band met de naam Deep Purple. Bij optredens speelde deze band voornamelijk nummers van de Mark-2 bezetting. Ritchie Blackmore ging toen naar de rechter die bepaalde dat de naam Deep Purple slechts gevoerd kon worden door een band met tenminste twee leden uit de Mark-II bezetting. Bovendien verloor Evans al zijn rechten op royalty's.\n\nIn de jaren '80 volgde een MkII-reüniealbum: Perfect Strangers, waarmee de groep er weer stevig tegenaan ging. Maar ook hier liep het weer uit op onderlinge problemen, met Gillan die de band verliet. Op het album Slaves and Masters, is Joe Lynn Turner (ex-Rainbow) op zang te horen. Op het navolgende album ' The Battle Rages On' keerde Ian Gillan terug. Tijdens de tournee voor dit album stapte Blackmore op en werd Joe Satriani tijdelijk zijn opvolger.\n\nDe laatsten die de groep versterkten waren Don Airey en Steve Morse. Het eerste album met Morse, Purpendicular, werd goed ontvangen. In 1999 werd na 30 jaar weer opgetreden met een orkest. Met de London Symphony Orchestra onder leiding van Paul Mann werd het Concerto uit 1969 opnieuw gespeeld. Op het album en dvd die verschijnen zijn vele gasten te horen zoals Ronnie James Dio en Sam Brown.\n\nDe huidige samenstelling (2006) is Airey / Gillan / Glover / Morse / Paice, en in deze samenstelling treden ze nog steeds op. In januari 2006 is Deep Purple begonnen aan de ongeveer twee jaar durende wereldtournee Rapture of the Deep. Op 18 april 2006 werd de nieuwe Ian Gillan-cd/dvd Gillan's Inn uitgebracht. Op 9 juni 2006 speelden ze voor de tweede keer op het Arrow Rock Festival te Lichtenvoorde. Tijdens de uitvoering van het nummer \"Smoke on the Water\" speelde de gitarist Neal Schon van Journey ook mee.\n\nDeep Purple zou op 27 juli 2006 een concert geven in Libanon. Het concert werd afgelast vanwege de oorlog met Israël. Op 13 november 2006 gaf Deep Purple een eenmalig concert in muziektempel Nikaïa in Nice in zuid-Frankrijk. Voorlopig is Deep Purple aan hun drie jaar durende tournee Rapture of the Deep. Hierbij zijn ze in de Lotto Arena in Antwerpen geweest.\n\nDeep Purple was op 15 juli 2006 ook de afsluiter van het Montreux Jazz Festival, dat dat jaar 40 jaar bestond.

I originaluppsättningen återfanns Rod Evans (sång) och Nick Simper (bas), mellan 1974–1976 var David Coverdale (sång) och Glenn Hughes (bas) med i bandet (Tommy Bolin ersatte Blackmore 1975) och mellan 1989–1992 var Joe Lynn Turner sångare i gruppen. Sedan gitarristen Steve Morse 1994 rekryterats till bandet har gruppen varit stadigare. Lord lämnade Deep Purple 2002 och bandet består idag av Gillan, Glover, Morse, Paice och Don Airey (orgel).\nEtt särdrag i Deep Purples musik, som skiljer dem från Led Zeppelin eller Black Sabbaths stil och som går igen i senare hårdrock, är influenserna från barockens musik, uttryckt som långa dueller mellan gitarr och orgel. Tydliga exempel på detta hörs i låtarna \"Speed King\", \"Highway Star\", \"Lazy\" och \"Burn\".",

      "bio_content": "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in London, in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock but their musical approach has changed over the years.Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.\n\nDeep Purple have had several line-up changes and were broken up for eight years from 1976 to 1984, with drummer Ian Paice being the band's only constant member. The first four line-ups, which constituted the band's original 1968–1976 run, are officially indicated as Mark I (1968–1969), Mark II (1969–1973), Mark III (1973–1975) and Mark IV (1975–1976). Mark I comprised the founding members of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Rod Evans (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Paice (drums) and Nick Simper (bass), while Mark II was the most commercially successful line-up, with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover replacing Evans and Simper respectively. Mark III saw David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes replace Gillan and Glover respectively, while Mark IV featured Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore. The band split in July 1976 and Bolin died from a drug overdose five months later. In 1984, Deep Purple reformed with the Mark II line-up, which remained in place until Joe Lynn Turner replaced Gillan in 1989. Gillan rejoined in 1992, with Blackmore leaving for the second and final time the following year. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse. In 2002 Don Airey replaced Jon Lord, which saw Deep Purple settle into its longest running line-up, unchanged for the next twenty years, until Morse announced his departure from the band in 2022. His place was taken by Simon McBride. Paice, Glover, Gillan, Airey and McBride comprise the current line-up of Deep Purple.\n\nDeep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme] and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale, Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_de": "\"Wir gingen nach Montreux ans Ufer des Genfer Sees ... hatten aber nicht viel Zeit\", erzählen Deep Purple zu Beginn ihres bekanntesten Songs. Erst belegt Frank Zappa das Casino, in dem sie aufnehmen sollen, dann fällt es auch noch einem Brand zum Opfer. Mit dem ausgeliehenen mobilen Soundequipment der Rolling Stones nehmen sie das Album \"Machinehead\" kurzerhand im Keller ihres Hotels auf. Dabei entsteht ein Track über die Erlebnisse in der Schweiz: \"Smoke On The Water\".\n\nDamit schaffen Deep Purple die bekannteste Hardrock-Hymne neben Black Sabbaths \"Paranoid\" und Led Zeppelins \"Stairway To Heaven\". Die drei Bands gelten als Gründer des Genres und kommen oft im gleichen Satz vor. Von vergleichsweise härteren Tönen abgesehen, haben Deep Purple jedoch wenig mit den anderen zwei gemeinsam. Einerseits, weil ihre Musik eher in der Klassik als im Blues wurzelt, andererseits, weil die Orgel wesentlicher Bestandteil ihrer Stücke ist.\n\nHinzu kommt ein ständiger Mitgliederwechsel. Die Gründer Jon Lord (Orgel), Ritchie Blackmore (Gitarre), Ian Paice (Schlagzeug), Nick Simper (Bass) und Rod Evans (Gesang) finden 1968 in England zusammen. Alle haben schon Band-Erfahrung, der Name stammt scheinbar aus dem Lieblingslied von Blackmores Oma.\n\nDen ersten Erfolg feiern sie mit dem Debütalbum \"Shades Of Deep Purple\": Ihre Coverversion von \"Hush\" erreicht Position fünf in den US-Singlecharts. Aber erst mit \"April\" aus ihrem dritten Album \"Deep Purple\" (1969) setzen sie die Weichen für ihre Zukunft. Das Stück gründet auf T.S. Eliots Poem \"The Waste Land\" und enthält lange Improvisationen von Lord und Blackmore.\n\nMit ihrer Kombination aus druckvollen harten Klängen und bis dahin in der Rockmusik unüblichen Tonleitern machen sie sich auch live einen Namen. Vor allem Lord entwickelt die Verbindung zwischen Rock und Klassik weiter. Die Erstaufführung seines \"Concerto For Group And Orchestra\" mit dem London Philharmonic Orchestra\" in der Royal Albert Hall 1969 begründet nicht nur ein neues Genre. Es ist auch der erste Auftritt ders bekanntesten Purple-Line-Ups, in dem Ian Gillan Evans und Roger Glover Simper ersetzen.\n\nDie folgenden drei Studioalben verschaffen den weltweiten Durchbruch. \"Fireball\" und \"Machine Head\" erreichen die Spitze der englischen Charts, mit \"Child In Time\", \"Highway Star\", \"Speed King\" und \"Smoke On The Water\" enthalten sie zudem die besten Stücke der Band in ihrer kreativ fruchtbarsten Phase. Davon zeugt das 72er Livealbum \"Made In Japan\", in dem die Zusammenarbeit zwischen der kräftigen Stimme Gillans, der Rhythmusgruppe Paice und Glover sowie den Virtuosen Lord und Blackmore ihren Höhepunkt erreicht.\n\n1973 ist das als \"Mark II\" bekannte Line-Up am Ende. Gillan und der immer egozentrischere Blackmore können sich nicht mehr riechen. Nach Gillans Auftritt in der Verfilmung von Andrew Lloyd Webbers Musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" und der eher schwachen LP \"Who Do We Think We Are\" werfen Glover und Gillan das Handtuch. An ihre Stelle treten Glenn Hughes und der spätere Whitesnake-Frontmann David Coverdale.\n\n\"Burn\" und \"Stormbringer\" (beide 1974) schaffen es in die Top Ten. Anschließend steigt Blackmore aus, um Rainbow zu gründen. Der neue Gitarrist Tommy Bolin schafft es in keinster Weise, seinen charismatischen Vorgänger zu ersetzen. Deep Purple lösen sich nach dem enttäuschenden \"Come Taste The Band\" (1975) auf. Wenige Monate später stirbt Bolin an einer Überdosis.\n\nNach mehr oder weniger erfolgreichen Nebentätigkeiten - Lord und Paice heuern zeitweise bei Whitesnake an, Gillan singt auf einem Black Sabbath-Album, veröffentlicht unter seinem eigenen Namen einige Platten, Blackmore festigt mit Rainbow seinen Kultstatus - finden die \"Mark II\"-Mitglieder 1984 überraschend wieder zusammen.\n\nDas Ergebnis sind nicht nur das gelungene Studioalbum \"Perfect Strangers\" (1984) und der Nachfolger \"The House Of Blue Light\" (1987), sondern auch eine ausgiebige Welttour, die auf \"Nobody's Perfect\" (1988) dokumentiert ist. Gillan und Blackmore kommen sich unvermeidlich erneut in die Quere und wieder ist es der Sänger, der den Hut nimmt. Mit dem ehemaligen Rainbow-Frontmann Joe Lynn Turner und dem 1990er Album \"Slaves & Masters\" beginnen anschließend sechs chaotische Jahre.\n\nFür die Studioplatte mit dem autobiografischen Titel \"The Battle Rages On ...\" (1993) kommt Gillan erneut ins Boot, springt aber kurz danach wieder ab. Dann ist es Blackmore, der mitten in der Welttour im Streit austritt, vorläufig ersetzt durch Joe Satriani. Dafür kehrt Gillan zurück. Auf dem '96er \"Purpendicular\" heißt der neue Mann schließlich Steve Morse, ehemaliger Gitarrist von Kansas.\n\nMit dieser Besetzung bringen Deep Purple auch \"Abandon\" (1998) heraus, touren anschließend jahrelang um die Welt und sind sich dabei nicht zu schade, auf kleineren Festivals oder in der Provinz aufzutreten. Blackmore sucht dagegen mit seiner Muse Candice Night unter dem Namen Blackmore's Night kostümiert mittelalterliche Schlosskeller auf und gibt erfolgreich Pseudo-Renaissancemusik zum Besten.\n\nNach einer Neuaufführung des \"Concerto For Group And Orchestra\" im Jahr 2000 beschließt Lord, sich seiner alten Liebe zu widmen, und steigt aus. Der Ersatzmann in der mittlerweile \"Mark VIII\"-Besetzung ist Keyboarder Don Airey, der schon für Rainbow, Gary Moore und Ozzy Osbourne gespielt hat. Trotz ihres vollgepackten Tourkalenders schaffen es Deep Purple auch immer wieder ins Studio. Auf \"Bananas\" (2003), \"Rapture Of The Deep\" (2005) folgt \"Now What?!\" (2013), das von 0 auf 1 in die deutschen Charts einsteigt.\n\nSo ist die Band weiterhin aktiv, ohne noch etwas grandios Neues zu erfinden oder überraschende Glanztaten zu vollbringen. Das haben gesetzte Herren, die für die Musikhistorie ohnehin genug beigetragen haben, auch nicht mehr wirklich nötig. Sie musizieren um des Musizierens willen.\n\nDas tut auch Lord nach seinem Abgang. 2007 steht er der australischen Band The Hoochie Coochie Men auf dem gelungenen Album \"Danger: White Men Dancing\" zur Seite, Anfang 2012 werkelt er mit den alten Purple-Kollegen Gillan und Blackmore am Charity-Projekt Who Cares mit. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt leidet Lord bereits an jenem Bauchspeicheldrüsenkrebs, an dem er am 16. Juli 2012 in London im Kreise seiner Angehörigen stirbt.",
      "biography_en": "It all started in 1968 when Chris Curtis, an ex-Searcher, formed a group withDave Curtiss (no relation, note different spelling) on bass, Bobby Woodman-Clarke on drums and brought in ex-Artwoods organist Jon Lord (born 9 June 1941, Leicester, England) and ex-Johnny Kidd andThe Pirates bassist, Nick Simper (born 3 November 1946, Southall, Middlesex).Nick had survived the car crash that had killed Johnny Kidd in 1966. GuitaristRitchie Blackmore (born 14 April 1945, Weston-super-Mare, England) joined inrehearsals for this new act initially dubbed Roundabout. Curtis dropped outwithin days, and when Dave and Bobby also proved incompatible, two members ofMaze, Rod Evans (born 19 January 1945, Edinburgh, Scotland; vocals) and IanPaice (born 29 June 1948, Nottinghamshire; drums), replaced them.\n\nHaving adopted the Deep Purple name (apparently inspired by Ritchie'sgrandmother's favorite song) following a brief Scandinavian tour in April 1968(where they played as Roundabout, \"in case they flopped\"), the quintetbegan recording their debut album, which they patterned on USA group VanillaFudge. \"Shades of Deep Purple\" thus included dramatic rearrangementsof well-known songs, including a faithful cover of Hendrix's version of\"Hey Joe\" and the Joe South-penned, Billy Joe Royal hit\"Hush\", the latter hitting US #4 in 1968 but not troubling the UKchart-compilers one bit.\n\nLengthy tours ensued as the group, all but ignored at home, steadfastly courtedthe burgeoning American concert circuit. \"The Book Of Taliesyn\" and\"Deep Purple\" albums also featured several excellent reworkings,notably \"Kentucky Woman\" (Neil Diamond) and \"River Deep MountainHigh\" (Ike And Tina Turner). The lengthy intro section to \"RiverDeep\" was a dramatic work-out of the theme from the then recently releasedStanley Kubrick sci-fi classic film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Thispiece was based on Richard Strauss' \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" and JonLord's classical leanings would soon culminate in a self-composed full-lengthwork performed at the  Royal Albert Hall in September 1969.\n\nThe band also drew acclaim for their original material and the dramaticinterplay between Lord and Blackmore. In concert these guitar/organ duels couldgo on for over 20 minutes!\n\nIn July 1969 both Evans and Simper were axed from the line-up, which was thenbuoyed by the arrival of Ian Gillan (born 19 August 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex,England; vocals) and Roger Glover (born 30 November 1945, Brecon, Wales; bass)from the pop group Episode Six. Acknowledged by aficionados as the\"classic\" Deep Purple line-up (forever onwards known as Mark II), thereshaped quintet made its album debut on the grandiose \"Concerto For GroupAnd Orchestra\", scored by Lord and recorded with the Royal PhilharmonicOrchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold (later sir Malcolm).\n\nIts hard rock successor, \"In Rock\", established the group as aleading heavy metal attraction and introduced such enduring favorites as\"Speed King\" and \"Child In Time.\" Gillan's powerfulsilver-throated vocals brought a third dimension to their sound and thisnew-found popularity in the UK was enhanced when the single, \"BlackNight\" reached number 2. \"Strange Kind Of Woman\" followed itinto the Top 10 (reaching #8 in Feb 1971), while \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\" both toppedthe album charts. The latter included the riff-laden \"Smoke On TheWater\", based on a real incident involving Frank Zappa and The Mothersand  an infamous Montreaux concert.\n\nAlthough the platinum-selling \"Made In Japan\" captured their liveprowess in full flight, relations within the band grew increasingly strained,and \"Who Do We Think We Are!\" would be the end of this highlysuccessful line-up.  The departures of Gillan and Glover robbed DeepPurple of an expressive frontman and imaginative arranger, although DavidCoverdale (born 22 September 1949, Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Lancashire, England;vocals) and Glenn Hughes (born 21 August 1952, Penkridge, Staffordshire;ex-Trapeze, bass & vocals) brought a new impetus to the act.\"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" both reached the Top 10, butBlackmore grew increasingly dissatisfied with the group's direction and in May1975 left to form Rainbow. US guitarist Tommy Bolin (born 18 April 1951, SiouxCity, Idaho), formerly of the James Gang and who had impressed Coverdale withhis playing on Billy Cobham's \"Spectrum\", joined Deep Purple for\"Come Taste The Band\", but his jazz/soul style was incompatible withthe group's heavy metal sound, and a now-tiring act folded in 1976 following afarewell UK tour.\n\nBolin died of a heroin overdose within months of Purple's demise. Judiciousarchives and 'best of' releases kept the group in the public eye, as did thehigh profile enjoyed by its several ex-members. Successful off-shoot bandsinclude Whitesnake, Rainbow and Gillan. Pressure for a reunion bore fruit in1984 when Gillan, Lord, Blackmore, Glover and Paice (the original Mark II)completed \"Perfect Strangers\". A whole new generation of fansdiscovered Deep Purple through this  release and subsequent US, Japaneseand European tour. A second album, \"The House Of Blue Light\",followed, but recurring animosity between Gillan and Blackmore resulted in thesinger's departure following the disappointing live album \"Nobody'sPerfect\" which included a 1988 rehearsal re-working of their first hit\"Hush\".\n\nJoe Lynn Turner, one of Blackmore's many Rainbow vocalists, joined and gave theband more of an AOR (Adult-Orientated Rock) direction. After a disappointingSlaves & Masters album released in 1990 (though Fire In The Basement isclassic 70s Purple), better sense prevailed. Gillan was re-admitted for histhird stint, uncomfortably sharing stage and studio with Blackmore. The line-upremained stable while the band recorded \"The Battle Rages On\" albumreleased in 1993, but Blackmore jumped ship once more during the tour thatfollowed. The tour was completed courtesy of US guitar whizzkid Joe Satriani.Contractual obligations however, meant his tenure could only be short-term andPurple hurriedly enlisted Steve Morse (ex-Kansas, Dixie Dregs, The Steve MorseBand, et al) (born 28 July 1954, Hamilton, Ohio) as his replacement to recordPurpendicular released early in 1996.\n\nSetting off on tour again, they took a fresh look at their 70s repertoire; tourhighlights were captured on the \"Live at the Olympia\" CD (1997) with forgottenfavorites jostling for position against new material from the \"Purpendicular\"set. Suddenly they felt they could have fun again, and the concerts wereenlivened by dropping old faves like \"Lazy\" and \"SpaceTruckin'\" in favour of new material and songs from the back catalogue thathad seldom if ever been played (such as \"Bloodsucker\", \"No OneCame\" and \"Rat Bat Blue\").\n\n1998's \"Abandon\" album had all the classic rock attitude, nasty guitars, poundingdrums and driving bass to scratch that R.O.C.K. itch. The album included abrilliant reworking of \"In Rock\"'s \"Bloodsucker\" (retitled\"Bludsucker\") and the Floydish-style \"Watching The Sky\"amongst other driving rock tracks.\n\nIn 1999 Deep Purple had a very successful tour of Australia and Europe. \n\nJon Lord retired in 2002 and was replaced by journeyman keyboardist Don Airey. This new line-up, which left Ian Paice as the only original member, released the stunning \"Bananas\" album in August 2003. Both a return-to-form and a look to the future, the \"Bananas\" album was well-accepted by the rock community at large.\n\nIn 2012 Deep Purple will record and release a new album.",
      "biography_es": "Deep Purple es una banda británica de hard rock formada en Hertford, Reino Unido, en 1968, que está considerada como una de las pioneras del hard rock y el heavy metal, aunque durante su carrera también ha incorporado elementos del rock progresivo, rock sinfónico, rock psicodélico, blues rock y de la música clásica. Deep Purple ha vendido más de 120 millones de discos en todo el mundo. Un concierto realizado en el Rainbow Theatre, de Londres, en julio de 1972, hizo que fueran registrados como \"la banda más ruidosa del planeta\" en los años 70's por el libro Guinness de los récords.\n\nLa banda ha sufrido múltiples cambios en su alineación a lo largo de las décadas, aunque permaneció inactiva desde julio de 1976 hasta su reunión, en abril de 1984. Sus cuatro primeras alineaciones son a menudo etiquetadas como \"Mark I\", \"II\", \"III\" y \"IV\". La \"Mark II\", formada por Ian Gillan (voz), Ritchie Blackmore (guitarra), Jon Lord (teclados), Ian Paice (batería) y Roger Glover (bajo), es considerada la alineación más exitosa, y la que mayores ventas ha cosechado, la cual se mantuvo en activo desde 1969 a 1973, de 1984 a 1989, y nuevamente de 1992 a 1993, cuando la relación entre Blackmore y el resto de los músicos se volvió insostenible.

      "biography_fr": "Deep Purple est un groupe de rock britannique fondé en 1968, considéré comme l'un des fondateurs du genre hard rock avec Led Zeppelin et Black Sabbath. Au cours de ses quarante ans d'existence, le groupe a toujours été constitué de cinq musiciens (un chanteur, un guitariste, un bassiste, un batteur, un organiste) mais a connu plusieurs changements de membres qui ont déterminé son évolution musicale. Les éléments caractéristiques du son de Deep Purple durant la majeure partie de son existence sont la guitare Fender Stratocaster de Ritchie Blackmore et l'orgue Hammond de Jon Lord.\n\nDurant ses deux années d'existence, le quintette original enregistre trois albums influencés par le psychédélisme de Vanilla Fudge et Jimi Hendrix. L'arrivée en 1969 du chanteur Ian Gillan et du bassiste Roger Glover donne lieu à la période la plus faste du groupe, avec les albums In Rock, Machine Head (avec le tube Smoke on the Water) et l'enregistrement en public Made in Japan. Après le départ de Gillan et Glover en 1973, leurs remplaçants David Coverdale et Glenn Hughes orientent la musique du groupe dans une direction soul et funk, et l'arrivée du guitariste Tommy Bolin en 1975 ne fait que renforcer cette évolution. Le groupe se sépare l'année suivante.\n\nLa formation emblématique du début des années 1970 se reforme en 1984, mais sa composition fluctue durant les dix années qui suivent, qui sont marquées par les tensions entre Ian Gillan et Ritchie Blackmore : le premier quitte de nouveau le groupe de 1989 à 1992, alors que le second en claque définitivement la porte en 1993. Deep Purple retrouve une certaine stabilité avec l'arrivée de son remplaçant Steve Morse l'année suivante. Depuis, le groupe continue à produire des albums tout en donnant des concerts dans le monde entier à un rythme soutenu.",
      "biography_it": "I Deep Purple sono un gruppo rock britannico nato nell'aprile del 1968 a Hertford, Inghilterra. Insieme a gruppi come Led Zeppelin e Black Sabbath, sono considerati fra i principali pionieri del genere heavy metal.[4][7]\nSi possono considerare i Deep Purple come una delle band musicalmente più complete degli anni settanta, con un sostrato musicale che spazia dal blues al Rock and roll, dal funky al jazz e al folk, dalla musica orientale alla musica classica fino al R&B. Ai Deep Purple va attribuita la prima commistione tra umori e temi musicali neoclassici al tempo e al ritmo tipici del blues e del rock and roll.[senza fonte] Il suono della band comprende anche elementi di rock progressivo e ciò li ha resi una band unica nell'hard rock e nell'heavy metal, visto che nessun altro gruppo rock è riuscito ad avere così tante influenze neoclassiche ed elementi di rock progressivo.\nHanno venduto più di 100 milioni di copie nel mondo[8][9] senza contare le enormi vendite di bootleg, cioè il traffico di dischi illegale spesso registrati nei live del gruppo, sempre formidabili, e sono stati presenti sul Guinness dei primati come la band più rumorosa del mondo.[10]\nA differenza di molti gruppi coetanei, nati dall'incontro di musicisti, i Deep Purple nacquero principalmente per la volontà di due manager: John Coletta e Tony Edwards.",

      "biography_nl": "Jon Lord startte in 1968 met een band onder de naam \"Roundabout\" met gitarist Ritchie Blackmore, maar veel succes had hij niet en al snel vertrokken de drummer en de bassist. Via twee mensen die manager van de groep wilden worden kreeg hij Nick Simper als bassist en Ian Paice als drummer. Rod Evans sloot zich bij de groep aan als zanger.\n\nDe groep wijzigde haar naam in Deep Purple, en nam een eerste single op: \"Hush\". Dit was meteen de eerste hit. De single werd gevolgd door een cover van \"Kentucky Woman\" van Neil Diamond, waarna de eerste lp volgde: Shades Of Deep Purple. De plaat was matig succesvol. De band besloot daarom zo snel mogelijk de volgende plaat, The Book of Taliesyn, uit te brengen. Deze lp had wel succes, en de weg voor Deep Purple lag open. De samenstelling van de groep was Ritchie Blackmore op gitaar, Rod Evans zang, Jon Lord op de keyboards, Ian Paice op de drum en Nick Simper op bas. In deze samenstelling werd een titelloos album uitgebracht, waarop Deep Purple voor het eerst samenwerkte met een orkest in April. In hetzelfde jaar schreef Jon Lord Concerto For Group and Orchestra, waarop de band samenwerkte met de Royal Philarmonic Orchestra onder leiding van Malcolm Arnold. Op het album zijn Gillan en Glover voor het eerst te beluisteren.\n\nMet het overkomen van Roger Glover en Ian Gillan van Episode Six naar Deep Purple slaat de groep een andere weg in. Het succes komt met het album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple zette hiermee haar naam als hardrockgroep en was met groepen als Led Zeppelin en Black Sabbath een van de pioniers van deze stijl. Black Night werd een hit in Nederland, maar kwam niet op het album te staan. Na In Rock volgde Fireball, waarvan de verkoopcijfers enigszins tegenvielen. In de VS komt de klassieker Strange Kind of Woman op het album te staan in plaats van Demon's Eye. Het titelnummer Fireball verscheen op single. Groter succes komt er als Child In Time (verdeeld over twee singlekanten) op single verschijnt in de Benelux. Het nummer zou later zeven jaar op nummer 1 staan in Veronica's Top 100 aller tijden. Het volgende album, Machine Head, wordt zowel artistiek als commercieel een groot succes. In de VS is de groep een mega-act geworden en Smoke on the Water is vaker op de Amerikaanse radio te horen dan het volkslied. Veel tracks van dit album komen in hetzelfde jaar op het dubbellivealbum Made in Japan. De samenstelling van de groep op deze albums was Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord en Ian Paice (MK2). In 1973 verscheen voorlopig het laatste album in deze bezetting met Who Do We Think We Are. Woman From Tokyo wordt wereldwijd op single gezet. Japan kiest voor een liveversie van Black Night als A-kant.\n\nNadien werden Ian Gillan en Roger Glover vervangen door David Coverdale en bassist Glenn Hughes die allebei de lead-vocals voor hun rekening nemen. In deze bezetting verschijnt het album Burn. De songs evolueerden weg van de heavy rock en invloeden uit de blues en de soul vonden hun weg. Uiteindelijk verliet Ritchie Blackmore de band waarna Tommy Bolin (ex-The James Gang) zijn plaats in nam. Na enkele live-miskleunen en een knappe Bolin-gesigneerde lp Come taste the Band legde Purple er tijdelijk de bijl bij neer. Bolin maakte, na het sublieme Teaser, nog een tweede LP met zijn eigen Bolin-band en overleed kort daarna aan een overdosis drugs op het moment dat hij met zijn eigen band het voorprogramma ging verzorgen voor Jeff Beck.\n\nVan de originele leden, Nick Simper en Rod Evans, bracht alleen Simper op een Duits label nog twee albums uit. Alle andere Purple-leden bouwden een vrij succesvolle carrière uit, maar het succes van Deep Purple wist niemand te evenaren.\n\nn 1980 vormde Rod Evans met enkele andere muzikanten een nieuwe band met de naam Deep Purple. Bij optredens speelde deze band voornamelijk nummers van de Mark-2 bezetting. Ritchie Blackmore ging toen naar de rechter die bepaalde dat de naam Deep Purple slechts gevoerd kon worden door een band met tenminste twee leden uit de Mark-II bezetting. Bovendien verloor Evans al zijn rechten op royalty's.\n\nIn de jaren '80 volgde een MkII-reüniealbum: Perfect Strangers, waarmee de groep er weer stevig tegenaan ging. Maar ook hier liep het weer uit op onderlinge problemen, met Gillan die de band verliet. Op het album Slaves and Masters, is Joe Lynn Turner (ex-Rainbow) op zang te horen. Op het navolgende album ' The Battle Rages On' keerde Ian Gillan terug. Tijdens de tournee voor dit album stapte Blackmore op en werd Joe Satriani tijdelijk zijn opvolger.\n\nDe laatsten die de groep versterkten waren Don Airey en Steve Morse. Het eerste album met Morse, Purpendicular, werd goed ontvangen. In 1999 werd na 30 jaar weer opgetreden met een orkest. Met de London Symphony Orchestra onder leiding van Paul Mann werd het Concerto uit 1969 opnieuw gespeeld. Op het album en dvd die verschijnen zijn vele gasten te horen zoals Ronnie James Dio en Sam Brown.\n\nDe huidige samenstelling (2006) is Airey / Gillan / Glover / Morse / Paice, en in deze samenstelling treden ze nog steeds op. In januari 2006 is Deep Purple begonnen aan de ongeveer twee jaar durende wereldtournee Rapture of the Deep. Op 18 april 2006 werd de nieuwe Ian Gillan-cd/dvd Gillan's Inn uitgebracht. Op 9 juni 2006 speelden ze voor de tweede keer op het Arrow Rock Festival te Lichtenvoorde. Tijdens de uitvoering van het nummer \"Smoke on the Water\" speelde de gitarist Neal Schon van Journey ook mee.\n\nDeep Purple zou op 27 juli 2006 een concert geven in Libanon. Het concert werd afgelast vanwege de oorlog met Israël. Op 13 november 2006 gaf Deep Purple een eenmalig concert in muziektempel Nikaïa in Nice in zuid-Frankrijk. Voorlopig is Deep Purple aan hun drie jaar durende tournee Rapture of the Deep. Hierbij zijn ze in de Lotto Arena in Antwerpen geweest.\n\nDeep Purple was op 15 juli 2006 ook de afsluiter van het Montreux Jazz Festival, dat dat jaar 40 jaar bestond. Deep Purple deed daar voor de derde keer mee, ook vanwege hun speciale band met Montreux door het nummer \"Smoke on the water\".

Medlemsuppsättningarna mellan 1968–1976 är kända som Mark I, II, III och IV. Mark II, som är den kommersiellt mest framgångsfulla uppsättningen, bestod av Ian Gillan (sång), Jon Lord (orgel), Roger Glover (bas), Ian Paice (trummor) och Ritchie Blackmore (gitarr). Mark II var aktiva mellan 1969–1973, 1984–1989 och slutligen 1992 till 1993. I originaluppsättningen återfanns Rod Evans (sång) och Nick Simper (bas), mellan 1974–1976 var David Coverdale (sång) och Glenn Hughes (bas) med i bandet (Tommy Bolin ersatte Blackmore 1975) och mellan 1989–1992 var Joe Lynn Turner sångare i gruppen. Sedan gitarristen Steve Morse 1994 rekryterats till bandet har gruppen varit stadigare. Lord lämnade Deep Purple 2002 och bandet består idag av Gillan, Glover, Morse, Paice och Don Airey (orgel).\nEtt särdrag i Deep Purples musik, som skiljer dem från Led Zeppelin eller Black Sabbaths stil och som går igen i senare hårdrock, är influenserna från barockens musik, uttryckt som långa dueller mellan gitarr och orgel. Tydliga exempel på detta hörs i låtarna \"Speed King\", \"Highway Star\", \"Lazy\" och \"Burn\".",
