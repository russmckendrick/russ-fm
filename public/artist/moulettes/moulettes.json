  "biography": "Moulettes is an English eclectic Art-Rock band that combines elements of Rock, Prog, Folk and Pop. The band was formed in 2002 in Glastonbury, England, by Hannah Miller (vocals, cello), Ruth Skipper (vocals, bassoon), Robert Skipper (later of The Holloways), Oliver Austin (drums, vocals) and Ted Dwane (bass).\n\nThe current line up is Hannah Miller (Cello, Vocals, Guitar), Oliver Austin (Drums, Guitar, Synths), Raevennan Husbandes (Vocals, Guitar), Jules Arthur (Synths, Viola, BVs), Mikey Simmonds (Violin, Viola, nyckelharpa, BVs)\n\nThe core of the band have been playing together since they met at school in Glastonbury with the festival\non their doorstep. Notably led by either a 4, 5 or 6 String Cello; the band use 3-part vocal harmony and often incorporates orchestral and progressive elements into their music. They occasionally play with a chamber orchestra, or in larger ensembles which include Georgina Leach (violin), Mikey Simmonds (violin), Anisa Arslanagic, Emma Gatrill (harp), Kate Young (violin), Eliza Jaye (violin and guitar), Marcus Hamblett (guitar, brass), percussionist Rob Arcari, Laura Hockenhull (vocals) & Faye Houston (vocals). Think Frank Zappa ‘s extended band, meets Broken Social Scene, meets one of those incestous Folk rock/pysch folk bands from the 60s/70s. Throw in the occasional American indie rock twists of Deerhoof and Tuneyards with Queen-scale vocal harmonies and epic string arrangements. Having spent a good number of years on the fringes of Folk, Indie & Prog Rock, the band has toured many circuits over U.K, Europe & Canada, playing Mainstages (Glastonbury, Montreal Jazz, Cropredy, Bestival, End of The Road, Cambridge Folk, Beautiful Days etc) , obscure ‘Dens on Iniquity’, Free parties on mysticaIslands and on UK BBC 6,2 &4 Radio stations. \n\nThe band have been nominated for several Best of The Year lists, and won Spiral Earth's Best Band and Album categories and won Featea Roots Music's best band of 2012. \n\nNoted for their creativity on the UK circuit they have shared the studio & stage with legends such as John Paul Jones, Seasick Steve, Nick Cave, Mick Jagger, Herbie Flowers (David Bowie, Lou Reed), Arthur Brown and members of Prog -Rocking Gentle Giant. They were asked to partly arrange the acoustic album from Punk-Folk Brightonian Legends, Levellers. This was recorded at Abbey Road and produced by John Leckie (Radiohead, Bellowhead). They have also had contemporaries from Mumford & Sons (Ted Dwane) , Band of Skulls, Bear’s Den, The Unthanks, Sarah Blasko’s Band, Sons of Noel and Adrian, Mystery Jets, Noisettes, Liz Green, Honey Feet, Resonators and Mike Dennis join the fold at different times. \n\nSubsequent albums include \"Constellations\" (2014), \"Preternatural\" (2016)\n\nMoulette/ˈmu.lət/noun\n1. (physics) a unit of force exerted by group of small objects/persons energy exerted results in force\ndisproportionate to their size.\n2. (botany, biology) Female anatomy ; a cell or embryonic vessel containing a hatchling.\n3. A type of barnacle or sea mollusk, known for their resilience & traction.
