      "biography": "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

      "editorial_notes": "At the Reading Festival in the summer of 2009, Radiohead gave the people what they wanted. The group’s set began with “Creep”, the song that had nearly made Radiohead one-hit wonders, released on a debut album the band members had all but disavowed. The next 22 songs ran like a greatest-hits collage, as the band moved from the rock atmospherics of <i>The Bends</i> to the electronic abstractions of <i>Kid A</i>, from the aggressive polemics of <i>Hail to the Thief</i> to the delicate swells of <i>In Rainbows</i>. The performance felt like career capstone for a group frequently cited as one of the most important in rock. “It was kind of like, ‘Well, that’s that; don’t need to go there again now,’” singer Thom Yorke remembered a few years later. “So there was a lot of... ‘Well, OK, if we are gonna carry on, we need to do it for a new set of reasons.’”\n\nThis restlessness was a standard refrain for Radiohead, of course; this is a band that’s spent years toggling between sounds and styles. But the sessions the group members started that summer with long-time producer Nigel Godrich proved especially fraught as they searched for the next direction. Though Yorke had a few elliptical strummers in process, they weren’t quite working for his bandmates. So they took the tapes and dumped them into digital files, which they began to dig through like hip-hop producers, looking for little bits they could loop in order to build something bigger. “You had to simplify what you were doing,” guitarist Ed O’Brien remembered. “You couldn’t do loads of ideas.” Slowly and painstakingly, then, they amassed <i>The King of Limbs</i>, featuring eight tracks that asked, once again, what it meant to be Radiohead at all.\n\nThe big thematic ideas of Radiohead’s albums yield to a vague sense of displacement on <i>The King of Limbs</i>—a feeling of planned obsolescence for ordinary people. Yorke’s words hang as drapery over the tightly wound rhythms of opener “Bloom”, in which icy electronics linger in the distance like spectres. He swivels inside of the percolating bass and drums of “Lotus Flower”, his falsetto filling the space between the beats with pure longing. Meanwhile, “Morning Mr. Magpie” buckles and jerks like Afrobeat, reduced to the scale of a rock band fretting for the future.\n\nThere are more straightforward moments here, especially the piano ache of “Codex”, but the overriding feeling of <i>The King of Limbs</i> is one of willful transition, of the band members recognising that their venerated past is only useful as a springboard into a future they were very much trying to stake. “If you think this is over,” Yorke sings over chiming guitars and skittering bits at the end, “then you’re wrong.” This is Radiohead, once again, pushing for the vanguard.",

It was released on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV formats. It was followed by a physical CD release on 28 March 2011. A special \"newspaper\" edition was released on 9 May. The \"newspaper\" edition contained two 10-inch vinyl records in a special record sleeve, many large sheets of artwork, 625 tiny pieces of artwork, a compact disc, and a colour piece of oxo-degradable plastic package.  The album was released by TBD in the United States, XL in the United Kingdom and Hostess Entertainment in Japan.\n\nThe album was announced on Radiohead's website on 14 February 2011, four days before release. The name of the album refers to an oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest, thought to be 1,000 years old. The tree is a pollarded oak, referring to an ancient technique for harvesting timber for fencing and firewood. Though it does not feature on maps, the tree is said to be 3 miles (4.8 km) from Tottenham Court House, where Radiohead recorded part of their previous album In Rainbows. On 18 February, Radiohead's official blog published the first song from the album, \"Lotus Flower\", with an accompanying music video, followed by a post announcing the album was released. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+King+of+Limbs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
