      "biography": "Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. One of the most celebrated artists of the twentieth century, Simon's career has spanned six decades. Born in New Jersey, Simon grew up in the borough of Queens in New York City and developed an interest in rock music in his teens.\n\nHe began performing with his schoolfriend Art Garfunkel in 1956; together the two came to prominence in the 1960s as Simon & Garfunkel. The duo's blend of folk and rock music in hits like \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"America\", and \"The Boxer\" served as a soundtrack to the counterculture movement. Their career together peaked with their last album, Bridge over Troubled Water (1970), at one point the best-selling album of all time. Throughout his subsequent solo career, Simon has continued to explore an eclectic mixture of genres, including gospel, reggae, soul, and more. His celebrated 1970s output—comprising Paul Simon (1972), There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973), and Still Crazy After All These Years (1975)—kept him in the public spotlight and saw critical and commercial acclaim, spawning the hits \"Mother and Child Reunion\", \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\", and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\".\n\nAcross his life, Simon has intermittently reunited with Garfunkel for several tours, including the famed Concert in Central Park. The widely lauded Graceland (1986) became Simon's biggest album of his career, melding his rock sound with worldbeat flavors; its single \"You Can Call Me Al\" became one of Simon's top hits. A sequel of sorts, The Rhythm of the Saints (1990), preceded his own successful Concert in the Park, attended by a half-million fans. That decade, Simon focused his energies on a Broadway musical The Capeman (1997), which was poorly received. In the first quarter of the next century, Simon continued to record and tour; his later albums, such as You're the One (2000), So Beautiful or So What (2011), and Stranger to Stranger (2016), have introduced him to new generations. He retired from touring in 2018. His most recent work, Seven Psalms, will see release in May 2023.\n\nSimon is among the most acclaimed musicians and songwriters in popular music, and one of the world's best-selling music artists, both for his solo work and with Garfunkel. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and has been the recipient of sixteen Grammy Awards, including three for Album of the Year. Two of his works, Sounds of Silence and Graceland, have seen induction into National Recording Registry for their cultural significance, and in 2007, the Library of Congress crowned him the inaugural winner of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. He is a co-founder of the Children's Health Fund, a nonprofit that provides medical care to children.\n\nIn an in-depth interview reprinted in American Songwriter, Simon discusses the craft of songwriting with music journalist Tom Moon. In the interview, Simon explains the basic themes in his songwriting: love, family and social commentary (as well as the overarching messages of religion, spirituality and God in his lyrics). Simon explains the process of how he goes about writing songs in the interview: \"The music always precedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts. Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It's like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the music is saying.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

And after some soul-searching, Simon turned the pop world on its ear—and revitalised his career in the process—with 1986’s <i>Graceland</i>, a synthesis of South African styles and U.S. singer/songwriter sensibilities. For the follow-up, <i>Rhythm of the Saints</i>, he doubled down on his then-radical investigation of world music, this time meshing his ideas with the sounds and players of Brazil. From the very first cut, \"The Obvious Child\", it's clear that Simon is venturing into more percussive and polyrhythmic territory than even <i>Graceland</i>, as Brazilian drum ensemble Olodum crashes and rumbles while Simon delivers a darting mix of impressionism and symbolism. The supple, sinuous flow of \"The Cool, Cool River\" empowers startlingly revelatory lyrical moments like \"sometimes even music cannot substitute for tears\".\nOn the gently flowing \"Spirit Voices\", Simon bounces his own voice off the angelic tones of legendary Brazilian troubadour Milton Nascimento, but South African influences slip in even amid Simon’s guitar patterns. In fact, with the presence of <i>Graceland</i> collaborators like guitarist Ray Phiri, bassist Bakithi Khumalo and singers Ladysmith Black Mambazo, much of the music takes on a broader Afro-Brazilian vibe. But while some lyrics echo the heady expansiveness of <i>Graceland</i>, others find Simon's observations more pointed than ever, as he comments on environmentalism on \"Can't Run But\" or middle age on the aforementioned \"The Obvious Child\". If <i>Graceland</i> served notice of Simon's eclecticism, <i>Saints</i> showed his continuing capacity for reinvention.",

            "content": "The Rhythm of the Saints is the eighth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Paul Simon, released on October 16, 1990 on Warner Bros. \n\nFollowing the success of 1986's Graceland, on which he worked principally with South African musicians, Simon broadened his interests in diverse forms of music from around the world. He turned to Latin America for the musicians and rhythms which characterize much of this album, partnering with Afro-Brazilian superstars Grupo Cultural Olodum, masters of the heavily percussive sub-style of samba called Batuque or Batucada. The group's drumming is featured on the opening song and first single, \"The Obvious Child\". Brazilian singer-songwriter Milton Nascimento co-wrote \"Spirit Voices\" and contributed some vocals. Guest appearances were also made by mandolin- and \"guitarra baiana\" master Armandinho, another Bahia musician, and by Afro-Cuban drummer Francisco Aguabella, and Puerto Rican-born drummer Giovanni Hidalgo. Another collaborator was jazz percussionist and master of the berimbau, Naná Vasconcelos; jazz guitarist Rafael Rabello also played on the album, along with many other Brazilian musicians.\n\nThe musical styles on The Rhythm of the Saints are, however, not uniformly Brazilian. US saxophonist Michael Brecker and other horn players contribute as session musicians (for example, on \"Proof\"), as well as American roots rock guitarist JJ Cale, Fabulous Thunderbirds vocalist Kim Wilson (contributing harmonica on \"The Obvious Child\"), R&B keyboards player Greg Phillinganes and jazz drummer Steve Gadd. Art rock guitarist and synth player Adrian Belew, who played on Graceland, is credited on \"Spirit Voices\". There are also many backing vocals on The Rhythm of the Saints, such as \"She Moves On\", a duet with Charlotte Mbango. Simon was also influenced by bikutsi for this album.\n\nThe album is characterized by impressionistic lyrics (referring to the Chernobyl incident in \"Can't Run But\", an Amazonian ayahuasca experience in \"Spirit Voices,\" and the state of the world in \"The Cool, Cool River\"), with slower tempos than Graceland and an atmospheric flow. Along with Latin rhythms, the prime influence on the album was West African and Central African music. Cameroonian jazz composer Andre Manga plays bass, and South African guitarist Ray Phiri, who also collaborated on Graceland, plays one song of the album, while famed trumpeter and worldbeat bandleader Hugh Masekela is credited with playing flugelhorn on one song.\n\nAlthough drums for \"The Obvious Child\" were recorded live at Pelourinho Square in Salvador, Bahia, Simon recorded most of the rhythms for the tracks in Rio de Janeiro studios before returning to The Hit Factory in New York City to record guitar accompaniment and, later, the final arrangements. The Rhythm of the Saints marks Simon's first collaboration with Cameroonian guitarist Vincent Nguini, a member of his band up until his death in December 2017. Nguini is credited with creating the music and guitar arrangements for \"The Coast\", although Simon still wrote the lyrics. Nguini also arranged guitar for other songs, such as \"She Moves On\" and \"The Cool, Cool River,\" and he arranged the horns for \"Proof.\" Together, Simon and Nguini created the melodies, lyrics, and arrangements that changed the bare rhythm and guitar recordings into (due to Simon's studio experience) the expertly-edited final product. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Simon/The+Rhythm+Of+The+Saints\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
