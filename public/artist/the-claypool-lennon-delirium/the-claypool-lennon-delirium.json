  "biography": "The joining of two of rock's most fearless and experimental musicians seems like a no-brainer -- even more so when considering their pedigrees. In 2015, as his band the Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger occupied the opening slot for the Primus tour, Sean Lennon got to play with Primus' virtuoso bassist Les Claypool. An on-stage jam during \"Southbound Pachyderm\" convinced Claypool that John's son could really play, and the pair decided to collaborate on a new project. The Claypool Lennon Delirium recorded at Claypool's home studio at Rancho Relaxo near Sonoma, California, crafting an unsurprising sound, considering the duo's origins. Their debut single -- the eight-minute mind-bender \"Cricket and the Genie\" -- shifts and swerves from style to style, exploring the spaces between psych rock, prog, a little acid, a lot of abstract, and even experimental pop. Their debut album, Monolith of Phobos, was released in June 2016. In April of the following year, the band released an exclusive four-song covers EP called Lime and Limpid Green to coincide with Record Store Day.",

They enthusiastically began work on an old-school, psychedelic and progressive rock record.  Over the course of six weeks, they wrote and recorded a total of ten songs, each sharing various vocal and instrumental responsibilities and expanding beyond their traditional core instruments of bass and guitar, culminating in the release of their first studio album, Monolith of Phobos. The album debuted in the Top 10 of three Billboard charts: Top Vinyl Albums, Top Tastemakers Albums, and Top Alternative Albums.\n\nOn February 22nd, 2019, the duo released their second studio album, South of Reality. The LP was written and recorded over two months at Claypool's home recording studio in California, and was preceded by the release of the six and a half minute long track \"Blood and Rockets\". The duo embarked on a brief headlining tour in support of the record in late 2018, with successive dates in the spring of 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Claypool+Lennon+Delirium\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
