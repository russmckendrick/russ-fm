Formed 2019-.\n\n1. Sermon is a metal band from Moscow, Russia. Their style is hard to classify, but would land somewhere in the realm of death/thrash metal with progressive and melodic leanings, and a variety of influences. They were originally known as SS-20, but changed their name to Sermon in 1994. They have released 3 full length albums, and one demo.\n\nalbums:\nFrom Death to Death (1998, CD)\nHypertonia (1999, Cassette only)\nFrustration (2003, CD)\n\nLast known Line-Up:\nPavel Suslov - Vocals, guitar\nSergey Smagin - Guitar\nVasily Rumjantsev - Bass\nDmitri Osipov - Drums\n\n2. UK Black Metal Sermon changed their name to Sermon Of Orion.\n\n3. Sermon was founded in the fall of 1997 in Germany, when Frank and Ray met. After some initial disappointments looking for a drummer they found Thorsten. They recorded one demo in the spring of 98 and the second in the summer with the help of Nikolai Potthoff of enfold. Unfortunately, not long after that, guitarist Ray left  Germany to go to college in New York, marking the end of the experiment in brutality called sermon, though the band got back together for a well-attended reunion in early 1999. \n\nAfter Sermon split Frank and Thorsten formed the kinetic crash cooperation. \nYears after the band split Kunal from SuperFi Records stumbled upon the demo mp3s online and liked them enough to offer to release them as a 7inch.\n\n6. Sermon is founded in 2019 and currently consists of two member, \"Him\" and James Steward. The band has released two albums. Birth of the Marvellous was released in 2019 and Of Golden Verse 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sermon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
