He rose to prominence as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and, after that, as the guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather, two bands that are still active on and off. White is also a recording artist in his own right and under his own name.\n\nJack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas.

      "biography": "There are five artists using this name:\n\n1) Witch is a psychedelic rock / zamrock band formed in 1971 in Kitwe, Zambia. This five-piece electric band plays a strong electric African underground style. Tons of wah wah-fuzz guitar in every track, African style beats and vocals and all original songs.\n\n2) Witch is a group born in 2005 from a marriage of apparently contradictory influences. J Mascis, renown as the vocalist, songwriter and guitarist of Dinosaur Jr. (and Heavy Blanket, Upsidedown Cross) and his long time friend Dave Sweetapple (Sweet Apple, Cobra Verde) were interested in forming a hard rock band.  They found willing and able conspirators in Kyle Thomas (King Tuff) and Asa Irons, both also members of New England avant-folk outfit Feathers. This line-up mounts a mighty sonic tumult that harkens back to classic heavy metal sound of early 1970s outfits while still sounding modern in it's assault (and without falling into the ubiquitous \"Stoner Rock\" pigeonhole). Instead of clinging to his forte, the electric guitar, J Mascis instead plays his first instrument, the drums. Witch's trademark sound (particularly in their early work) shows obvious Black Sabbath influence and moments of Black Flag has also been noted for their sophomore effort, Paralyzed.\n\n3) Witch is a duo formed in 1980 by S. Joplin Babashoff and The Bird (later joined by guitarist Gloonis Botnik to create a trio). Over the past 26 years, Witch has recorded and released over 15 albums.\n\n4) Witch was an American heavy metal band formed in 1983 in Los Angeles, CA. They released the cult classic EP \"The Hex Is On\" in 1984. Members included Punky Peru (drums, vocals), Ronny Too (guitar, vocals), Peter Wabitt (lead vocals) and Jim Warmon (bass, vocals).\n\n5) Witch is a Japanese female singer / songwriter.

      "biography": "Dinosaur Jr. are an alternative rock band which formed in 1983 in Amherst, Massachusetts. The band was formed by J Mascis (guitar and vocals) and his high school classmate Lou Barlow (bass guitar), following the break-up of their hardcore punk band Deep Wound. Shortly afterwards, Murph (Emmett Patrick Murphy, drums) joined them. \n\nThe band was originally called \"Dinosaur\", but changed its name following the release of its debut album Dinosaur in 1985, after a band called Dinosaurs, featuring ex-members of Country Joe and the Fish and Jefferson Airplane, threatened them with legal action. (They still used the name Dinosaur on their albums until 1987 at the latest, and some copies of You're Living All Over Me still lack the \"Jr\").\n\nIn 1987, Dinosaur Jr. signed to SST Records on the recommendation of Sonic Youth, and with them released what is often considered their best album, You're Living All Over Me. Bug followed the next year, an album which, in the UK, was released by Paul Smith's Blast First Records (home to Sonic Youth, Big Black and Butthole Surfers). During this period Dinosaur Jr. became known for their very loud concerts. \n\nDespite not gaining much commercial success, the band has enjoyed something of a cult following. The success of singles Freak Scene and Just Like Heaven, and recommendations from the likes of Sonic Youth saw them signed by Warner Brothers. The signature Dinosaur Jr. sound is the melodic tunes saturated in layers of guitar noise and punctuated by J Mascis' elaborate, yet laconic guitar solos.  They were a major influence on the up-and-coming band Nirvana.\n\nTensions ran high between Mascis and Barlow, and in 1989 Barlow was kicked out of the band.  As a result, Barlow continued  to work with his own band, Sebadoh. The two famously fell out on stage with Mascis attacking Barlow. Dinosaur Jr. subsequently became little more than a pseudonym for Mascis. He switched labels to Blanco y Negro in the UK, Warner/Sire in the US, with Green Mind (1991) being his first release in that deal.\n\nAfter Barlow left the band, Van Conner, from the Screaming Trees, played bass for at least one live show in 1990, and Donna Dresch, from Team Dresch played bass at least once live with the band in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Mike Johnson joined Dinosaur Jr as full-time bass player. He was in the band for 1991's Whatever's Cool With Me, 1993's Where You Been, 1994's Without A Sound, and 1997's Hand It Over. \n\nMurph left the band in late 1993, after the Lollapalooza tour.\n\nGeorge Berz took over on drums, and drummed from 1994-1997. He was on Without A Sound, and Hand It Over. He later drummed for J Mascis + the Fog in 2000, 2001, and 2003.\n\nThrough the 90s, Mascis sometimes explored quieter and more tranquil shores than Dinosaur Jr. had in the 80s. The band formed part of the 1992 \"Rollercoaster\" tour. A package tour based on the successful \"Lollapalooza\". The tour featured The Jesus & Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine & Blur. On the 1993 release, Where You Been, the opening track (\"Out There\") had an accompanying video and was aired on MTV for a short time. After 1994's Without a Sound and 1997's Hand It Over, Mascis began to release albums with the band J Mascis and the Fog.\n\nIn 2004, J Mascis regained the master rights to the first three Dinosaur Jr. albums from SST, and arranged for their reissue on the Merge label in early 2005. The reissues coincided with an announcement that the original lineup of  J Mascis, Lou Barlow and Murph (Emmett Patrick Murphy) were reuniting for a summer tour. The success of this tour resulted in a new album entitled Beyond (2007) and single Been There All The Time. They are Lou Barlow's first recording with the band since 1989. The original line-up of Dinosaur Jr. has been touring extensively since 2005. They are currently on a world tour.\n\nOn February 20, 2009, Pitchfork Media announced that the band had signed with indie label Jagjaguwar, and their first release on the label entitled Farm was released June 23, 2009, to largely positive reviews. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dinosaur+Jr.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography": "Mudhoney are an American Grunge band formed in Seattle, Washington in 1988, following the demise of Green River. Mudhoney's members are singer and rhythm guitarist Mark Arm, lead guitarist Steve Turner, bassist Guy Maddison and drummer Dan Peters. Original bassist Matt Lukin left the band in 1999.\n\nMudhoney's early releases on the Sub Pop label, particularly their debut single \"Touch Me I'm Sick\" and the Superfuzz Bigmuff EP, were massively influential on the Seattle music scene. More than almost any other release of the era they inspired the dirty, high-distortion sound that would become grunge. Later on, Mudhoney also mixed heavy blues rock and punk rock into their sound at various stages. They could be considered an influence on the niche sub-genre dubbed \"cowpunk\". Their highly psychedelic sound as well as their distortedly \"fried\" guitar-tone achieved through the \"superfuzz\" and \"bigmuff\" pedals (after which their debut EP was named) constitutes a large influence on the development of (modern) stoner rock and the harder sounds of stoner metal. Mudhoney dynamics and riffing can de identified all across those genres. Although the band has found little commercial success during its long career, which has yielded ten studio albums, it has inspired countless grunge and alternative rock musicians.\n    \nBand history\n\nMr. Epp and the Calculations\n\nThe very beginnings of Mudhoney start out in Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. While at Bellevue Christian High School, Mark McLaughlin (later known as Mark Arm) and some friends started Mr. Epp and the Calculations, a band named after a math teacher of his. The band was more a joke band than a real band; their first \"show\" was in class singing Marvin Gaye's \"Got to Give It Up\" and using rolled up maps as guitars because they couldn't play real instruments. \"Mr. Epp\" finally played their first show three years after they formed in 1981. Around this time Mark Arm and a friend of his, Steve Turner formed a more serious yet still humorous band, Limp Richerds. Mr. Epp appeared on KZAM-AM radio and were introduced being called \"the worst band in the world\". They played their last show on February 3, 1984 with Malfunkshun at the Metropolis in Seattle.\n\nGreen River\n\nGreen River was formed in 1984 when Mark Arm and Steve Turner pulled together and recruited Alex Vincent, who had previously played with Turner in Spluii Numa. Looking for a bass player the band asked Jeff Ament to join their band. Ament had recently arrived in Seattle with his band Deranged Diction who had come out of Montana. Another one of Turner's former bandmates, Stone Gossard, also decided to play with them. Steve Turner left the band after the recording of Come on Down due to his distaste in the heavy metal leanings of the band. He was replaced by another Derranged Diction member, Bruce Fairweather. After recording two EPs and a full-length album, the band decided to call it quits in 1987. Gossard, Ament, and Fairweather went on to join Mother Love Bone. Following lead singer, Andrew Wood's death, Gossard and Ament went on to form Pearl Jam and Fairweather joined Love Battery. Arm reunited with Steve Turner to form Mudhoney.\n\nSub Pop (1988–1991)\n\nSteve Turner wanted to start a band that actually rehearsed before they played. He and Mark Arm began working on some music along with Bundle of Hiss drummer Dan Peters. The trio decided that Matt Lukin, who had recently left Melvins, should join them as the bassist. They named themselves Mudhoney after a Russ Meyer film that none of the band members had actually seen.\nMudhoney's partial success led to a number of other Seattle bands, such as Soundgarden, Nirvana, and Tad, gaining some recognition. In the early '90s, Sub Pop was not making very much money. As a result, many of its bands left the label to search for backing by major labels. Mudhoney decided to stay and they released their second album, Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge in 1991. However, after this album was released they were offered a deal with Reprise Records and they left Sub Pop Records to join their new major label in 1992.\n\nReprise (1992–1999)\n\nAs grunge was becoming more mainstream, Mudhoney shifted away from their early grungy music sound. Many of the bands that they were friends with (Nirvana and Pearl Jam) were having huge success and gaining popularity worldwide. Their first album on Reprise was Piece of Cake, which was an album that sounded much more like garage rock than grunge. Despite the fact that the band had signed on to a major label, they still kept their quirkiness and non-careerist attitude with them.\n\nIn 1995, when grunge was in its last days in the mainstream, Mudhoney decided to go back to the sound that they used to have. With their album My Brother the Cow they managed to mix both their early heavy dirge songs and some of their more punk rock songs on the same album. The song \"Into Your Shtik\" is said to be a song which bashes Courtney Love, saying that she should blow her head off too like her husband Kurt Cobain. The album is a fan favorite and is considered one of their finest albums. Two years later they released Tomorrow Hit Today. The album showed that Mudhoney still had their garage rock roots in them as well as including new blues rock type songs.\n\nIn 1996, Mudhoney appeared in the comedy movie Black Sheep, starring Chris Farley and David Spade. Mudhoney was shown playing at an MTV concert and then speaking with Farley backstage.\n\nAfter a few years of touring, Reprise decided to release Mudhoney from their label. One of the reasons was Mudhoney's record sales had reached a career low despite the fact their live shows were drawing more people than ever before. Subsequently, bassist Matt Lukin called it quits, saying that he didn't like touring. The band released March to Fuzz, a retrospective compilation of songs from throughout their career. Many fans thought that the band was going to stop playing music altogether, although they did play a few shows around the Northwest area.\n\nReturn to Sub Pop (1999— )\n\nThese shows were doing so well that Mudhoney decided to resurrect their careers. They found permanent bassist Guy Maddison (of Monroe's Fur, Lubricated Goat) who had played with Mark Arm in one of his many side projects, Bloodloss. After Arm and Turner spent time with their side project, The Monkeywrench, the band recorded and released Since We've Become Translucent in 2002. In late 2005, the band opened Pearl Jam's South American tour, with concerts in Santiago de Chile, Buenos Aires, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In March of 2006, the band released the well received LP, Under a Billion Suns. The band has promoted the album by touring in Europe and the U.S. with bands such as Jennifer Gentle, The Holy Soul and Comets on Fire.\n\nIn 2008 with the release of their album The Lucky Ones, they paid tribute to the short-lived and influential hardcore punk band Tales of Terror, by naming a song after them. A band which is generally considered \"proto-grunge\" and that was very influential in the rise of grunge itself and to the sound Mudhoney carved for themselves. Green River had originally honoured them back in the late 80s with a cover of their song \"Ozzy\" for the EP Dry As A Bone and even the Melvins covered their song \"Romance\" at some point. Aside from Nirvana's Kurt Cobain's including their only LP on his list of \"top 50 albums ever\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mudhoney\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In March of 2006, the band released the well received LP, Under a Billion Suns. The band has promoted the album by touring in Europe and the U.S. with bands such as Jennifer Gentle, The Holy Soul and Comets on Fire.\n\nIn 2008 with the release of their album The Lucky Ones, they paid tribute to the short-lived and influential hardcore punk band Tales of Terror, by naming a song after them. A band which is generally considered \"proto-grunge\" and that was very influential in the rise of grunge itself and to the sound Mudhoney carved for themselves. Green River had originally honoured them back in the late 80s with a cover of their song \"Ozzy\" for the EP Dry As A Bone and even the Melvins covered their song \"Romance\" at some point. Aside from Nirvana's Kurt Cobain's including their only LP on his list of \"top 50 albums ever\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mudhoney\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography": "There are five artists using this name:\n\n1) Witch is a psychedelic rock / zamrock band formed in 1971 in Kitwe, Zambia. This five-piece electric band plays a strong electric African underground style. Tons of wah wah-fuzz guitar in every track, African style beats and vocals and all original songs.\n\n2) Witch is a group born in 2005 from a marriage of apparently contradictory influences. J Mascis, renown as the vocalist, songwriter and guitarist of Dinosaur Jr. (and Heavy Blanket, Upsidedown Cross) and his long time friend Dave Sweetapple (Sweet Apple, Cobra Verde) were interested in forming a hard rock band.  They found willing and able conspirators in Kyle Thomas (King Tuff) and Asa Irons, both also members of New England avant-folk outfit Feathers. This line-up mounts a mighty sonic tumult that harkens back to classic heavy metal sound of early 1970s outfits while still sounding modern in it's assault (and without falling into the ubiquitous \"Stoner Rock\" pigeonhole). Instead of clinging to his forte, the electric guitar, J Mascis instead plays his first instrument, the drums. Witch's trademark sound (particularly in their early work) shows obvious Black Sabbath influence and moments of Black Flag has also been noted for their sophomore effort, Paralyzed.\n\n3) Witch is a duo formed in 1980 by S. Joplin Babashoff and The Bird (later joined by guitarist Gloonis Botnik to create a trio). Over the past 26 years, Witch has recorded and released over 15 albums.\n\n4) Witch was an American heavy metal band formed in 1983 in Los Angeles, CA. They released the cult classic EP \"The Hex Is On\" in 1984. Members included Punky Peru (drums, vocals), Ronny Too (guitar, vocals), Peter Wabitt (lead vocals) and Jim Warmon (bass, vocals).\n\n5) Witch is a Japanese female singer / songwriter. Circle: Sound CYCLONE. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Witch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

Since the duo’s dissolution in 2011, Jack White has continued playing with form (and colour schemes), from the just-one-of-the-boys-in-the-band vibes of The Raconteurs to 2022’s sonically experimental <i>Fear of the Dawn</i> and its more restrained companion <i>Entering Heaven Alive</i>. Despite—or perhaps <i>to</i> spite—those who longed for a simpler, noisier, more monochromatic time, White tinkered away.\n\nThe rollout for <i>No Name</i>, White’s sixth solo album, was characteristically mischievous: It first appeared as a white-label LP given away at Third Man Records before being posted online without song titles, sparking an excitement that felt fresh, largely because the sound did not. Meg White is not walking through that door anytime soon, but the 13 tracks here channel the unadorned, wild-eyed ferocity of the band that made him famous more efficiently and consistently than anything he’s done since. There’s plenty of swagger from top to bottom, but most of all there’s <i>hooks</i>: big, fat, noisy guitars played in the catchiest combinations possible. \n\n“That’s How I’m Feeling” may not relieve “Seven Nation Army” of its ubiquity anytime soon, but it is a ready-made capital-A anthem with a euphoric jump-scare chorus that sticks on first listen and doesn’t get unstuck. “Bless Yourself”, “Tonight (Was a Long Time Ago)” and “Number One With a Bullet” are just as infectious, while “Bombing Out” may be the fastest, heaviest thing White has ever put out in any of his many guises. The casualness of it all is a flex—as meticulous and exacting as White can be, <i>No Name</i>’s modest arrival is a reminder of how easily he could have kept churning out earworm White Stripes songs. Good for him that he didn’t want to; good for us that he does now.",
