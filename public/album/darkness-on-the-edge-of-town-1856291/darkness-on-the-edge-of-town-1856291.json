      "biography": "Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and humanitarian. He is best known for his work with his E Street Band. Nicknamed \"The Boss,\" Springsteen is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, Americana, working class and sometimes political sentiments centered on his native New Jersey, his distinctive voice and his lengthy and energetic stage performances, with concerts from the 1970s to the present decade running over three hours in length.\nSpringsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the U.S.A. (1984), showcase a talent for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life; he has sold more than 64 million albums in the United States and more than 120 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award as well as being inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999.",

      "editorial_notes": "Released three years after the epic <i>Born to Run</i>, Bruce Springsteen’s fourth album is full of the literal darkness in the album title—but it also also crackles with power and intensity. <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> wasn’t an easy album to make: It didn’t arrive until 1978, largely because Springsteen had signed a contract preventing him from working with any producer not approved by the singer’s management. Springsteen sued his manager; his manager sued him back; and, as a result, the Boss spent a year and a half fighting to defend everything he had worked for.\n\nThat defiance can be found throughout <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i>, from the lyrics to the vocals to the instrumental performances. You can hear Springsteen’s anger—as well as the sheer relief of achieving his freedom. But you can also sense Springsteen’s very real fear that everyone had forgotten about him, and his awareness that this record was going to make or break his future. The material was powerful enough—but the emotional catharsis required to bring it together took <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> to another level.\n\nSo there’s the snarling saga of father/son dynamics in “Adam Raised a Cain”; the firecracker fuse of lust in “Something in the Night” and “Candy’s Room”; the dull mundanity of the 9-to-5 job in “Factory”. Springsteen’s writing was informed by a new interest in classical country music, as well as an increasing affinity with American cinema. The dignity of adult life, and the sharp jump-cuts of B movies, informed a record featuring Springsteen’s now-familiar cast of ne’er-do-wells. These are people who’ve evolved past their days of living hard and getting into trouble. Springsteen’s characters in <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> are trying to get by—but they’re desperate and making bad decisions along the way. They’re running out of road.\n\nYou can hear their desperation in “Racing in the Street” or on the sombre title track. But this is hardly a hopeless album. Springsteen also included beacons of light in the form of “Badlands”, “The Promised Land” and “Prove It All Night”—a trinity that would expand far beyond their roles as lifelines on this record, and come to symbolise the universal quest for hope and redemption.",
