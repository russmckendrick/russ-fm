      "biography": "Metallica are an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from the band, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.\n\nMetallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its self-titled fifth album, Metallica (1991), was the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. This was followed by the band's 10th studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2016), with its 11th album, 72 Seasons, releasing in 2023.\n\nIn 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film Metallica: Through the Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.\n\nMetallica has released 10 studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), 12 video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with Metallica) have consecutively debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked the band No. 61 on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica\n\nStudio albums\nKill 'Em All (1983)\nRide the Lightning (1984)\nMaster of Puppets (1986)\n...And Justice for All (1988)\nMetallica (1991)\nLoad (1996)\nReload (1997)\nSt. Anger (2003)\nDeath Magnetic (2008)\nHardwired... to Self-Destruct (2016)\n72 Seasons (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Metallica\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Not because of their inordinate influence on Metallica, or even because Metallica felt a kinship with them—but because Jethro Tull hadn’t put out their own album that year to stand as competition.<br />\nTull had infamously won the award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 1989—a reflection of both the Academy’s disconnect with metal culture and how uneasily it sat in the mainstream. And while The Black Album’s win didn’t constitute acceptance, per se, it acknowledged what fans of the band had understood for going on 10 years: Metal was the vanguard of hard rock, and Metallica was the vanguard of metal.<br />\nDrummer and co-writer Lars Ulrich says they used to labour for hours over the perfect take, Frankenstein-ing together fragments of drum parts, punching in riffs, blending and overdubbing until every wrinkle was ironed flat. They wanted precision, and by precision they meant technical mastery—a superlative in a world where the goal is to play as hard, fast and complicatedly as possible without slipping.<br />\nAnd it isn’t that The Black Album isn’t complex. But whereas tracks like “One”, “Master of Puppets” and “Seek & Destroy”—songs that not only defined Metallica’s sound, but the sound of ’80s metal in general—foregrounded complexity as proof of the band’s stamina and ambition, the music here is streamlined and the performances natural. Ulrich says producer Bob Rock helped them understand their recordings not just as seamless stacks of riffs, but as shapes with ebb and flow, rise and fall.<br />\nIn the songs’ simplicity is a clear confidence: “Enter Sandman” and “Sad but True” are two of the heaviest tracks the band recorded, but also two of the most straightforward. “The Unforgiven” evokes Celtic folk and the majestic spaghetti Western soundtracks of Ennio Morricone (whose “The Ecstasy of Gold” long served as their walk-on music), but it works just as well around the campfire. James Hetfield wasn’t sure whether “Nothing Else Matters” even belonged on a Metallica album—it was so personal, so disclosing. But they’d always trusted their gut, and in doing so helped revise Led Zeppelin ballads for the post-punk era: They thrash, but they do it with tenderness. ",

            "content": "Metallica (also known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released August 12, 1991 through Elektra Records. It features some of Metallica's most popular songs, \"Enter Sandman\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Nothing Else Matters\" , \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Sad but True\". It spent four consecutive weeks at number one on Billboard 200. Metallica is the band's best-selling album to date, with over 16 million physical copies sold in the United States and over 31 million copies worldwide. It is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.\n\nThe album cover features only the band's logo, angled against the upper left corner, and a coiled snake (derived from the Gadsden flag) on the bottom right corner, both in a dark shade of gray in order to be made out against the black background. The motto of the Gadsden flag, \"Don't Tread on Me\", is also the title of a song featured on the album.\n\nThe cover is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's Smell the Glove album, something the band jokingly acknowledged themselves in their A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary (where members of Spinal Tap appeared and asked them about it).\n\nMetallica DVD-Audio 5.1 mix was released in 2004 through Elektra Records.\n\nWhile the album and the band were critically praised and commercially successful, some fans expressed disappointment in the new direction taken by Metallica. Gone for the most part were faster staccato riffs during verses and throaty vocals found on the band's first four albums; the overall speed and complexity of the music was somewhat lessened. The Black Album presented a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible Metallica, especially evidenced by the ballad \"Nothing Else Matters\". Moreover, following the success of \"One,\" the breakaway single from their …And Justice for All album, five videos were released from The Black Album. (\"Enter Sandman\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"Sad but True\", \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"The Unforgiven\").\n\nThe lyrics of The Black Album, written by James Hetfield, were much more personal and introspective in nature than previous Metallica albums. For example, \"The God That Failed\" dealt with Hetfield's mother's death from cancer and her Christian Science beliefs which kept her from seeking medical treatment. \"Nothing Else Matters\" expresses the connection Hetfield felt with a girlfriend while out on the road. The album ended Metallica's tradition of including a lengthy instrumental track on each album until their 2008 album Death Magnetic.\n\n    * Rolling Stone (9/5/91) - 5 Stars — Excellent — Included in Rolling Stone's \"Essential Recordings of the 90's\" - \"Several songs...seem destined to become hard-rock classics.... effectively bridg the gap between commercial metal and the much harder thrash of Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth.\" In 2003, the album was ranked number 252 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n    * Spin (9/99, p.146) - Ranked #52 in Spin Magazine's \"90 Greatest Albums of the '90s\" - Spin (p.89) - \"This record's diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band's melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads.\"\n\n    * Entertainment Weekly (8/16/91) - \"Rock's preeminent speed-metal cyclone...Metallica may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash.\" - Rating: B+\n\n    * Q magazine (8/00, p.127) - Included in Q's \"Best Metal Albums of All Time\" - \"Transformed them from cult metal heroes into global superstars....bringing a little refinement to their undoubted power.\"\n\n    * Melody Maker (12/91) - Ranked #16 in Melody Maker's list of the top 30 albums of 1991 - \"In a committed move away from their thrash roots, Metallica was slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as anything they'd done before.\"\n\n\nMetallica was produced by Bob Rock, who was originally asked to mix the album as the band was impressed with his work as producer on the Mötley Crüe album, Dr. Feelgood. Initially, the band was not interested in having Rock produce their album, but changed their minds as Ulrich stated; \"We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob  could help us make it.\" The Black Album's sound was a marked difference from the stripped down production of the previous album. Rock altered the band's working schedule and routine so much that they swore never to work with him again. The animosity and tension between band and producer was documented in the documentaries A Year And A Half In The Life of Metallica and Classic Albums: The Black Album. Both explore and document the intense and merciless recording process that resulted in The Black Album.\n\nDespite the controversies between the band and Rock, he continued to work with the band up until, and including, the 2003 album St. Anger.\n\nThe world tour following the Metallica album, initially dubbed the \"Wherever We May Roam Tour\" and then later the \"Nowhere Else To Roam Tour\", saw Metallica on the road for the next three years. The tour was in part documented in the A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary, as well as the 3-CD, 2-DVD (or 3-VHS) boxset Live Shit: Binge & Purge. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Metallica\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
