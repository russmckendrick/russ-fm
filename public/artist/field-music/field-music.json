  "biography": "Field Music are a band from Sunderland, England who formed in 2004. The band's core consists of brothers David and Peter Brewis (who at one time played drums for fellow Sunderland band The Futureheads), with Andrew Moore featuring as pianist on the first two albums and as part of Peter Brewis's solo project The Week That Was. Their line-ups have at times featured members of both Maxïmo Park and The Futureheads. Previous incarnations include The New Tellers and Electronic Eye Machine.\n\nField Music released their eponymous debut album in August 2005. A collection of B-sides and earlier songs, Write Your Own History, was released in May 2006. Their second album, Tones Of Town, was released on January 22, 2007.\nIn an interview with BBC 6 Music in April 2007 the band claimed they were intending to split once the promotional engagements for Tones Of Town were completed in June 2007.\n\"We basically want to do things that aren't classed as 'Field Music indie band'. We're not going to be a band for a bit. But Field Music aren't going to be over because we've already got a bank account under the name, so we'll just continue as a company. It's time to go and do some real work.\"\nField Music later confirmed that the band has not split. On their official website the band members addressed the issue and reassured fans as they are still a band they simply wished it to be known that the band is a by-product of their existence, not their reason for it.\nDavid Brewis released an album as School Of Language in February 2008 through Memphis Industries (in the UK and Ireland) and Thrill Jockey Records (in the US and Europe), while Peter Brewis recorded an album under the name The Week That Was which was released on 18 August 2008, also with Memphis Industries, and featured both David Brewis and Andrew Moore on some tracks.\nIn an interview with Stereogum in July 2009, the band confirmed that they had reunited (minus Andrew Moore) and were busy recording a third Field Music record. The 20 tune album, titled 'Field Music (Measure)' was released through Memphis Industries in February, 2010 (Feb. 15 in the UK, Feb. 16 in the US).\nField Music have been celebrated as one of the few bands to transcend and outlast the short-lived NME-generated \"post-punk revival\" of the mid-noughties. Describing the band as \"a truly artful proposition in the pseud-filled landscape of contemporary Brit art-rock\", music blog The Fantastic Hope puts this down in part to their \"un-self-conscious anti-fashion stance\", arguing that Field Music's \"wayward pop from the fringes of academia is one of the most worthwhile ways in which rock//indie/guitar music/white pop/whatever might evolve\".\nThe band was chosen personally by Belle & Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow's Parties in the UK in December 2010.\nTheir fourth album, Plumb, was released on February 13, 2012. It was preceded by the song \"(I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing\", available as a free download from their website. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize that year.\nIn September 2013, it was revealed that Field Music had composed a soundtrack for the 1929 silent documentary Drifters.  The film, which originally premiered alongside Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin, was made by pioneering Scottish director John Grierson and follows the working day of a herring fishing fleet as it sets sail from the Shetland Islands. Field Music premiered the work with a live performance and screening for Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival. This commission sees the original line-up of Peter Brewis, David Brewis and Andrew Moore reunite for the first time since 2007. A subsequent screening and performance was planned for London’s Islington Assembly Hall in November 2013. \nDavid Brewis played with former Fiery Furnaces singer Eleanor Friedberger on her UK tour in the summer of 2013. \nIn an interview with Songfacts.com, legendary guitarist and producer Al Kooper said that Field Music is his favorite new band.",

Additionally, Binding Time, in which the band collaborated with brass instrumentalists from the NASUWT Riverside Band, was released in limited quantity for Record Store Day 2024.\\n\\nThree of these albums (2015\\'s Music For Drifters, 2020\\'s Making A New World, and 2024\\'s Binding Time) began as commissioned projects, originally intended to be played for specific events before ultimately being released in an album format. Music For Drifters was commissioned by the Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival and acts as a soundtrack to the 1929 silent film Drifters. Making A New World was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum and is a concept album inspired by the end of World War I and its subsequent effects on the world in the following century. Binding Time, commissioned by the Durham Miners Association and inspired by the history and legacy of the local mining industry, was arranged for and performed at the Durham Brass Festival.\\n\\nPlumb was nominated for the 2012 Mercury Prize.\\n\\nAfter the release of Tones of Town, the group announced a break, leading to solo releases by the brothers (David\\'s \"Sea From Shore\" under the name School of Language and Peter\\'s album as The Week That Was, both 2008), before reconvening in 2009. Both brothers have continued releasing music outside of the band: School of Language now has 3 albums and an EP, while Peter has worked with contemporaries Paul Smith of Maxïmo Park (Frozen By Sight) as well as Sarah Hayes of Admiral Fallow (You Tell Me). \\n\\nIn 2022, the Brewis brothers created their own record label (Daylight Saving Records), hosting what they initially referred to as \"extra-curricular activities;\" releases include Slug\\'s Thy Socialite!, the acoustic David Brewis solo album The Soft Struggles, a collaborative EP with former band member Andrew Moore entitled Songs From The Shelf, and the mostly-instrumental electronic Peter Brewis solo album Blowdry Colossus, all released in 2023. Binding Time is the first Field Music album to be released under Daylight Saving Records.\\n\\nAll Field Music albums were self-produced at the band\\'s studio space in Sunderland.\\n\\nOther musicians who have played in the group in some form include Andrew Moore, Tom English, Kevin Dosdale, Ian Black, Damo Waters, Andrew Lowther, Peter Gofton, Mark Simms, Emma Fisk, Peter Richardson, Liz Corney, and Pauline Brandon. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Field+Music\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "Field Music are a band from Sunderland, England who formed in 2004. The band's core consists of brothers David and Peter Brewis (who at one time played drums for fellow Sunderland band The Futureheads), with Andrew Moore featuring as pianist on the first two albums and as part of Peter Brewis's solo project The Week That Was. Their line-ups have at times featured members of both Maxïmo Park and The Futureheads. Previous incarnations include The New Tellers and Electronic Eye Machine.\n\nField Music released their eponymous debut album in August 2005. A collection of B-sides and earlier songs, Write Your Own History, was released in May 2006. Their second album, Tones Of Town, was released on January 22, 2007.\nIn an interview with BBC 6 Music in April 2007 the band claimed they were intending to split once the promotional engagements for Tones Of Town were completed in June 2007.\n\"We basically want to do things that aren't classed as 'Field Music indie band'. We're not going to be a band for a bit. But Field Music aren't going to be over because we've already got a bank account under the name, so we'll just continue as a company. It's time to go and do some real work.\"\nField Music later confirmed that the band has not split. On their official website the band members addressed the issue and reassured fans as they are still a band they simply wished it to be known that the band is a by-product of their existence, not their reason for it.\nDavid Brewis released an album as School Of Language in February 2008 through Memphis Industries (in the UK and Ireland) and Thrill Jockey Records (in the US and Europe), while Peter Brewis recorded an album under the name The Week That Was which was released on 18 August 2008, also with Memphis Industries, and featured both David Brewis and Andrew Moore on some tracks.\nIn an interview with Stereogum in July 2009, the band confirmed that they had reunited (minus Andrew Moore) and were busy recording a third Field Music record. The 20 tune album, titled 'Field Music (Measure)' was released through Memphis Industries in February, 2010 (Feb. 15 in the UK, Feb. 16 in the US).\nField Music have been celebrated as one of the few bands to transcend and outlast the short-lived NME-generated \"post-punk revival\" of the mid-noughties. Describing the band as \"a truly artful proposition in the pseud-filled landscape of contemporary Brit art-rock\", music blog The Fantastic Hope puts this down in part to their \"un-self-conscious anti-fashion stance\", arguing that Field Music's \"wayward pop from the fringes of academia is one of the most worthwhile ways in which rock//indie/guitar music/white pop/whatever might evolve\".\nThe band was chosen personally by Belle & Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow's Parties in the UK in December 2010.\nTheir fourth album, Plumb, was released on February 13, 2012. It was preceded by the song \"(I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing\", available as a free download from their website. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize that year.\nIn September 2013, it was revealed that Field Music had composed a soundtrack for the 1929 silent documentary Drifters.  The film, which originally premiered alongside Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin, was made by pioneering Scottish director John Grierson and follows the working day of a herring fishing fleet as it sets sail from the Shetland Islands. Field Music premiered the work with a live performance and screening for Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival. This commission sees the original line-up of Peter Brewis, David Brewis and Andrew Moore reunite for the first time since 2007. A subsequent screening and performance was planned for London’s Islington Assembly Hall in November 2013. \nDavid Brewis played with former Fiery Furnaces singer Eleanor Friedberger on her UK tour in the summer of 2013. \nIn an interview with Songfacts.com, legendary guitarist and producer Al Kooper said that Field Music is his favorite new band.",

      "biography_en": "Field Music are a band from Sunderland, England who formed in 2004. The band's core consists of brothers David and Peter Brewis (who at one time played drums for fellow Sunderland band The Futureheads), with Andrew Moore featuring as pianist on the first two albums and as part of Peter Brewis's solo project The Week That Was. Their line-ups have at times featured members of both Maxïmo Park and The Futureheads. Previous incarnations include The New Tellers and Electronic Eye Machine.\n\nField Music released their eponymous debut album in August 2005. A collection of B-sides and earlier songs, Write Your Own History, was released in May 2006. Their second album, Tones Of Town, was released on January 22, 2007.\nIn an interview with BBC 6 Music in April 2007 the band claimed they were intending to split once the promotional engagements for Tones Of Town were completed in June 2007.\n\"We basically want to do things that aren't classed as 'Field Music indie band'. We're not going to be a band for a bit. But Field Music aren't going to be over because we've already got a bank account under the name, so we'll just continue as a company. It's time to go and do some real work.\"\nField Music later confirmed that the band has not split. On their official website the band members addressed the issue and reassured fans as they are still a band they simply wished it to be known that the band is a by-product of their existence, not their reason for it.\nDavid Brewis released an album as School Of Language in February 2008 through Memphis Industries (in the UK and Ireland) and Thrill Jockey Records (in the US and Europe), while Peter Brewis recorded an album under the name The Week That Was which was released on 18 August 2008, also with Memphis Industries, and featured both David Brewis and Andrew Moore on some tracks.\nIn an interview with Stereogum in July 2009, the band confirmed that they had reunited (minus Andrew Moore) and were busy recording a third Field Music record. The 20 tune album, titled 'Field Music (Measure)' was released through Memphis Industries in February, 2010 (Feb. 15 in the UK, Feb. 16 in the US).\nField Music have been celebrated as one of the few bands to transcend and outlast the short-lived NME-generated \"post-punk revival\" of the mid-noughties. Describing the band as \"a truly artful proposition in the pseud-filled landscape of contemporary Brit art-rock\", music blog The Fantastic Hope puts this down in part to their \"un-self-conscious anti-fashion stance\", arguing that Field Music's \"wayward pop from the fringes of academia is one of the most worthwhile ways in which rock//indie/guitar music/white pop/whatever might evolve\".\nThe band was chosen personally by Belle & Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow's Parties in the UK in December 2010.\nTheir fourth album, Plumb, was released on February 13, 2012. It was preceded by the song \"(I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing\", available as a free download from their website. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize that year.\nIn September 2013, it was revealed that Field Music had composed a soundtrack for the 1929 silent documentary Drifters.  The film, which originally premiered alongside Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin, was made by pioneering Scottish director John Grierson and follows the working day of a herring fishing fleet as it sets sail from the Shetland Islands. Field Music premiered the work with a live performance and screening for Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival. This commission sees the original line-up of Peter Brewis, David Brewis and Andrew Moore reunite for the first time since 2007. A subsequent screening and performance was planned for London’s Islington Assembly Hall in November 2013. \nDavid Brewis played with former Fiery Furnaces singer Eleanor Friedberger on her UK tour in the summer of 2013. \nIn an interview with Songfacts.com, legendary guitarist and producer Al Kooper said that Field Music is his favorite new band.",
