  "biography": "Although Eels are often marketed as a full-fledged band, singer/songwriter E (real name: Mark Oliver Everett) is responsible for the group's sound and direction. Born in Virginia on April 9, 1963, Everett became interested in rock music at an early age via his sister's record collection, and began playing drums at the age of six (as well as tinkering on his family's piano). As the years progressed, Everett began leading a troubled teenage life, which was further complicated by his father's death. However, the turmoil led to an even stronger interest in music, as he taught himself how to play his sister's guitar and began writing his own original compositions. (Tragedy would later form the catalyst for Eels' magnum opus, Electro-Shock Blues.)\n\nDue to the fact that several of his friends also were named Mark, it was also around this time that Everett began going by his initials -- and eventually, solely by the letter \"E.\" By his early twenties, E was recording demo material on a used four-track cassette recorder, and eventually decided to pursue his rock & roll dreams by relocating to Los Angeles. Due to his prolific songwriting, the quality of his tunes naturally began to improve, which led to a recording contract as a solo artist for Polydor Records. This was followed by a pair of underappreciated releases, 1992's A Man Called E (which was supported with a tour opening for Tori Amos) and 1993's Broken Toy Shop, before E left the label and formed Eels along with bassist Tommy Walter and drummer Butch Norton. The trio inked a deal with the then-newly formed Dreamworks label and issued Eels' debut, 1996's Beautiful Freak. The album spawned a sizable MTV/alternative radio hit with \"Novocaine for the Soul,\" its promo clip received three MTV Video Music Award nominations the following year, and the group's popularity rose in England (resulting in a Brit Award, which was presented to the group by goof metallists Spinal Tap).\n\nWhat should have been a time of great promise for E turned out to be one of tragedy, as both the singer's sister and mother passed away in quick succession. This was compounded by Walter's departure from the group. The dark mood resonated in Eels' sophomore effort, Electro-Shock Blues, which proved to be stronger than its predecessor yet failed to fuel much commercial success. With new bassist Adam Siegal in tow, the group toured behind the album's release before returning to the studio immediately afterward to work on a third album. Issued in 2000, Daisies of the Galaxy offered a slightly brighter outlook and featured a guest appearance from R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck, who also helped co-pen a track. Despite the album's commercial failure, E put together \"the Eels Orchestra\" and launched an international tour in support of its release. The six-piece band featured saxophone, trombone, trumpet, banjo, guitar, violin, upright bass, piano, melodica, clarinet, and timpani -- to make it work on-stage, each bandmember was required to play three to four different instruments each night.\n\nAfter a live recording of the 2000 Eels Orchestra tour, Oh What a Beautiful Morning, was issued via the group's official website, E began preparing for Eels' fourth studio release. Instead of penning the entire album by himself (as he'd done with the group's previous work), E turned to John Parish for help. The two created Souljacker, which was issued throughout most of the world in September 2001 and hit American shores early the following year (in the U.S., the first edition of the CD also contained a bonus four-track disc). The resulting tour saw E and Norton joined by multi-instrumentalist Parish, as well as new bassist/synthesizer player Koool G Murder. A live disc, Electro-Shock Blues Show, followed soon after to promote the tour.\n \nSpring 2003 began a flurry of Eels/E-related releases, beginning with MC Honky and his SpinART release I Am the Messiah. While the man behind Messiah's splattering mix of hip-hop beats, dance grooves, and kitschy samples was little more than E in DJ drag, the album was nevertheless an enjoyable slice of summertime fun. E's score for the indie film Levity arrived in April, and June saw the release of the Eels' fifth studio album, Shootenanny! Its follow-up, 2005's Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, was an ambitious double album including 33 songs. Eels' With Strings: Live at Town Hall album, recorded June 30, 2005, documented the New York Town Hall performance during their 2005 tour of the same name, and another With Strings: Live at Town Hall edition was simultaneously issued in February 2006 with a concert DVD.\n \nIn 2008, Eels released two CD/DVD sets -- Meet the Eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1 and Useless Trinkets: B Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996-2007. The band's music also comprised the bulk of the soundtrack for Yes Man, a comedy featuring Jim Carrey. E then returned to the drawing board and emerged with Hombre Lobo, a concept album about desire that arrived in mid-2009, followed closely by the MySpace Transmissions Session 2009 live EP. The lo-fi End Times, which revolved around the central theme of broken love, arrived in 2010, but was followed in August by Tomorrow Morning, a much more polished album of upbeat optimism that relied heavily on analog electronics to drive its songs. In 2011 Eels issued Hombre Loco, End Times, and Tomorrow Morning as a box set entitled Trilogy with an accompanying DVD. Greg Prato, Rovi",

Band members have changed over the years, both in the studio and on stage, making Everett the only official member for most of the band\\'s work. Eels\\' music is often filled with themes of family, death, and unrequited love. Since 1996, Eels has released fourteen studio albums, seven of which charted in the Billboard 200.\\n\\nHistory\\nE solo records\\nIn 1991, Everett signed a contract with Polydor and released A Man Called E under the name E a year later. The single \"Hello Cruel World\" was a minor success. Touring to support the album, E opened for Tori Amos. A Man Called E was followed by Broken Toy Shop in 1993. This year also marked the beginning of E\\'s collaboration with drummer Jonathan \"Butch\" Norton. After Broken Toy Shop, E was released from his record deal with Polydor. E has performed two of the songs from Broken Toy Shop (\"The Only Thing I Care About\" and \"Manchester Girl\") for his own live shows with the Eels.\\n\\nBeautiful Freak\\nEels were officially founded when Butch and E met Tommy Walter. The name \"Eels\" was chosen so that the band\\'s records would be close to E\\'s solo records in an alphabetical ordering, although it was too late once they realized that numerous Eagles and Earth, Wind & Fire releases were in between. Eels became one of the first groups to sign a record deal with DreamWorks Records, followed by Elliott Smith.\\n\\nIn 1996, the band released their debut album Beautiful Freak. The singles \"Novocaine for the Soul\", \"Susan\\'s House\" and \"Your Lucky Day in Hell\" achieved modest national and international success, with the band winning the Best International Breakthrough Act award at the 1998 BRIT Awards. In 1996 and 1997, Eels toured extensively to support the album, building their name as a live act in the United States and Europe. In September 1997, Walter quit the band.\\n\\nReleased in May 2001, the motion picture soundtrack for the movie Shrek included the song \"My Beloved Monster\".\\n\\nElectro-Shock Blues\\nFollowing the success of Beautiful Freak, E experienced a difficult time in his personal life. His sister committed suicide, and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. These events inspired Eels\\' second album, 1998\\'s Electro-Shock Blues. The album deals with many difficult subjects, including cancer, mental illness, suicide and death. The tragedy of Everett\\'s father\\'s death became prominent once more in the context of his mother\\'s impending death and his sister\\'s suicide, and as a result the song \"Baby Genius\" is written for his father Hugh Everett III. Contributions to the album were made by Jon Brion, Lisa Germano, Jim Jacobsen, Grant-Lee Phillips, Dust Brother Michael Simpson, and T-Bone Burnett.\\n\\nThe single \"Last Stop: This Town\" saw minor success, while \"Cancer for the Cure\", the second single from the album, appeared on the soundtrack for American Beauty (1999).\\n\\nStill a three-piece band on stage, Tommy Walter was replaced by Adam Siegel. Part of the American leg of the tour was cancelled after the death of E\\'s mother. They returned to tour Europe later in the year, to open for Pulp.\\n\\nDaisies of the Galaxy\\nIn 2000, Eels released Daisies of the Galaxy. The album, which was recorded almost entirely in E\\'s basement, is lighter and more upbeat than its predecessor. Everett noted, \"if Electro-Shock Blues was the phone call in the middle of the night that the world doesn\\'t want to answer, then Daisies of the Galaxy is the hotel wake-up call that says your lovely breakfast is ready\". He was joined in the studio by Michael Simpson (Dust Brothers), Grant-Lee Phillips (Grant Lee Buffalo), and Peter Buck (R.E.M.).\\n\\nThe first single, \"Mr. E\\'s Beautiful Blues\", was co-written by Simpson. The song was not intended to be on the album, but the record company insisted on its inclusion. Therefore, it was not featured on the track listing but was instead listed on the cover sticker as a bonus track, separated from the rest of the album by 20 seconds of silence.\\n\\nTo promote Daisies of the Galaxy, another tour took place across the United States and Europe, with the band also playing their first concerts in Australia. For these performances, Eels were transformed into a 6-piece orchestra, including Lisa Germano and Probyn Gregory. E also played some solo shows, opening for Fiona Apple.\\n\\nSouljacker and Shootenanny!\\nIn 2001, Souljacker was released, an album with a heavier feel and more rock-oriented sound than Daisies of the Galaxy. John Parish, previously of PJ Harvey\\'s band, co-wrote most of the songs and played guitar on the album and first part of the tour. After Parish became a father, he was replaced with Joe Gore for the American leg of the Bus Driving, Band Rocking Tour. Koool G Murder played bass and keyboards and joined Eels on tour.\\n\\n2003 marked the release of the album Shootenanny!. E now refers to the album as a break from recording the following Blinking Lights album. It was recorded live in the studio in only ten days. \"Saturday Morning\" was released as a single.\\n\\nButch was replaced on drums by Puddin\\'. In 2003, Eels embarked upon another big tour, called the Tour of Duty. The live band consisted of E, Goldenboy (guitar), Koool G Murder (bass) and Puddin\\' (drums). Later that year, E composed the score for the film Levity.\\n\\nBlinking Lights and Other Revelations and Eels with Strings\\nEels\\' next album, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, was released on April 26, 2005, and was the band\\'s first release for new label Vagrant Records. It is a 33-track double album. Contributions were made by Tom Waits, Peter Buck, John Sebastian (The Lovin\\' Spoonful), Jim Jacobsen, and Butch.\\n\\nThe first tour in support of the Blinking Lights album, billed as Eels with Strings, featured primarily performances by E on acoustic guitar, organ or piano, backed by Allen \"Big Al\" Hunter on piano and upright bass, Jeffrey Lyster (also known as Chet Atkins III or \"The Chet\") on guitar, mandolin, pedal steel, musical saw and drums, and a string quartet consisting of violinists Paloma Udovic and Julie Carpenter, violist Heather Lockie and cellist Ana Lenchantin. The tour resulted in a live album, Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall, recorded in New York City. The performance includes tracks from all of their albums, and was released on CD and DVD on February 21, 2006.\\n\\nMeet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I and Useless Trinkets\\nIn early 2008, Eels released their first \"greatest hits\" compilation as well as a compilation of B-sides, rarities, soundtrack singles and unreleased tracks. Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I spans the first decade of the Eels, including singles from all their albums, as well as a DVD featuring music videos and one live performance video. Useless Trinkets contains 50 B-sides and rarities and a DVD of their Lollapalooza 2006 performances. To promote the releases, the band went on a world tour, An Evening With Eels. This time, only the Chet joined E on stage, both playing a broad cross-section from the Eels repertoire on a variety of instruments. The concerts also featured the Chet reading excerpts from E\\'s 2008 autobiography, Things the Grandchildren Should Know. On this tour, the band released a live CD/DVD package of Eels\\' 2006 performance at the London Astoria, Live and in Person!, documenting a show from the second tour in support of Blinking Lights and Other Revelations.\\n\\nThe soundtrack of the 2008 comedy film Yes Man features nine songs by Eels, including \"Man Up\", a brand new song.\\n\\nConcept album trilogy: Hombre Lobo, End Times, and Tomorrow Morning\\nHombre Lobo, the seventh Eels studio album, was released on June 2, 2009. The album comprises twelve new songs. \"Hombre Lobo\" is Spanish for \"wolf man\" or \"werewolf\" and references E\\'s unusually long beard, which he originally grew when writing the song \"Dog Faced Boy\". On March 31, 2009, the band made the track \"Fresh Blood\" available on Spinner, explaining that the song would be the lead single for the album. A Jesse Dylan-directed music video was released on April 29, 2009 as well. The album was released as a single-disc CD and a deluxe edition with a DVD. In September 2009, Eels released a music video for \"That Look You Give That Guy\", featuring Bobby Jr., E and Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi.\\n\\nWhile promoting this album, Eels released the live EP The Myspace Transmissions Session 2009 on October 14, 2009. That same day, the band\\'s website announced that a new Eels album entitled End Times would be released on January 19, 2010. It was largely recorded on a four-track recorder and is based on the themes of broken love. Three album tracks—\"Little Bird\", \"In My Younger Days\", and \"A Line in the Dirt\"—were made available as music videos or promotional downloads prior to the release of the album. Once again, Butch contributed drums to \"A Line in the Dirt\". On January 19, 2010, End Times was released. E made no comment on touring and there was no tour scheduled to begin.\\n\\nA second album was announced on May 20, 2010: Tomorrow Morning was described as the \"final installment of a trilogy that began with Hombre Lobo and End Times.\" The three albums respectively explore themes of desire, loss, and redemption. A world tour, the first since 2007\\'s An Evening With Eels tour, was announced at the same time. This tour once again featured the Chet on various instruments, alongside Koool G Murder on bass, trilogy drummer Knuckles on drums and a new member, P-Boo, on guitar.\\n\\nWonderful, Glorious and The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett\\nOn February 5, 2013, the 10th Eels studio album was released, entitled Wonderful, Glorious. The first single from the album, \"Peach Blossom\", premiered on SoundCloud on November 6, 2012. A month later, on December 4, 2012, the official video was released on Stereogum. The second single, \"New Alphabet\", was streamed pre-release on December 12, 2012 on Spinner\\n\\nOn March 25, 2013, the band released a parody music video called \"Cold Dead Hand\" through Funny or Die, with Jim Carrey replacing E on vocals. The song and video, set as a musical act during the variety program Hee Haw, lampoons American gun culture, and specifically former NRA spokesperson Charlton Heston.\\n\\nEels\\' eleventh studio album, The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett, was released on April 21, 2014 on E Works Records. In April 2015, the band released the DVD and double live album Live at the Royal Albert Hall.\\n\\nIn 2015, Eels created their own version of Melanie De Biasio\\'s track \"I Feel You\" for the album Gilles Peterson Presents - No Deal Remixed. The track was later used to promote the 2017 film Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, and appears during the entire in-universe short movie Meet Walter starring Michael Fassbender.\\n\\nThe Deconstruction and Earth to Dora\\nOn January 17, 2018, Eels announced their 12th studio album, The Deconstruction, to be released on April 6, 2018, their first in nearly four years. They also announced a supporting tour throughout the United States and Europe, beginning in Pomona, California on May 28, 2018. The album travels through many styles sonically, but its lyrics primarily deal with rebuilding one\\'s life and looking back on what went wrong. Singles include (in release order) the title track, \"Today Is the Day\", \"Premonition\", and \"Bone Dry\". Styles present on the album include orchestral pop, power pop, psychedelic pop/rock, indie/alternative rock and post-modern pop.\\n\\nThe band\\'s next release was the single \"Baby Let\\'s Make It Real\"/\"Who You Say You Are\", announced on September 1, 2020. These songs were featured on the subsequent studio album, Earth to Dora (2020).\\n\\nExtreme Witchcraft\\nOn September 21, 2021, it was announced that the 14th Eels album would be called Extreme Witchcraft and would be released on January 28, 2022. The album was produced by E and John Parish in their first collaboration since 2001\\'s Souljacker.\\n\\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eels_(band)\\n\\nStudio albums\\nAs E\\nA Man Called E (1992)\\nBroken Toy Shop (1993)\\n\\nAs Eels\\nBeautiful Freak (1996)\\nElectro-Shock Blues (1998)\\nDaisies of the Galaxy (2000)\\nSouljacker (2001)\\nShootenanny!

The name \"Eels\" was chosen so that the band\\'s records would be close to E\\'s solo records in an alphabetical ordering, although it was too late once they realized that numerous Eagles and Earth, Wind & Fire releases were in between.

In 1996 and 1997, Eels toured extensively to support the album, building their name as a live act in the United States and Europe. In September 1997, Walter quit the band.\\n\\nReleased in May 2001, the motion picture soundtrack for the movie Shrek included the song \"My Beloved Monster\".\\n\\nElectro-Shock Blues\\nFollowing the success of Beautiful Freak, E experienced a difficult time in his personal life. His sister committed suicide, and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. These events inspired Eels\\' second album, 1998\\'s Electro-Shock Blues. The album deals with many difficult subjects, including cancer, mental illness, suicide and death. The tragedy of Everett\\'s father\\'s death became prominent once more in the context of his mother\\'s impending death and his sister\\'s suicide, and as a result the song \"Baby Genius\" is written for his father Hugh Everett III. Contributions to the album were made by Jon Brion, Lisa Germano, Jim Jacobsen, Grant-Lee Phillips, Dust Brother Michael Simpson, and T-Bone Burnett.\\n\\nThe single \"Last Stop: This Town\" saw minor success, while \"Cancer for the Cure\", the second single from the album, appeared on the soundtrack for American Beauty (1999).\\n\\nStill a three-piece band on stage, Tommy Walter was replaced by Adam Siegel. Part of the American leg of the tour was cancelled after the death of E\\'s mother. They returned to tour Europe later in the year, to open for Pulp.\\n\\nDaisies of the Galaxy\\nIn 2000, Eels released Daisies of the Galaxy. The album, which was recorded almost entirely in E\\'s basement, is lighter and more upbeat than its predecessor. Everett noted, \"if Electro-Shock Blues was the phone call in the middle of the night that the world doesn\\'t want to answer, then Daisies of the Galaxy is the hotel wake-up call that says your lovely breakfast is ready\". He was joined in the studio by Michael Simpson (Dust Brothers), Grant-Lee Phillips (Grant Lee Buffalo), and Peter Buck (R.E.M.).\\n\\nThe first single, \"Mr. E\\'s Beautiful Blues\", was co-written by Simpson. The song was not intended to be on the album, but the record company insisted on its inclusion. Therefore, it was not featured on the track listing but was instead listed on the cover sticker as a bonus track, separated from the rest of the album by 20 seconds of silence.\\n\\nTo promote Daisies of the Galaxy, another tour took place across the United States and Europe, with the band also playing their first concerts in Australia. For these performances, Eels were transformed into a 6-piece orchestra, including Lisa Germano and Probyn Gregory. E also played some solo shows, opening for Fiona Apple.\\n\\nSouljacker and Shootenanny!\\nIn 2001, Souljacker was released, an album with a heavier feel and more rock-oriented sound than Daisies of the Galaxy. John Parish, previously of PJ Harvey\\'s band, co-wrote most of the songs and played guitar on the album and first part of the tour. After Parish became a father, he was replaced with Joe Gore for the American leg of the Bus Driving, Band Rocking Tour. Koool G Murder played bass and keyboards and joined Eels on tour.\\n\\n2003 marked the release of the album Shootenanny!. E now refers to the album as a break from recording the following Blinking Lights album. It was recorded live in the studio in only ten days. \"Saturday Morning\" was released as a single.\\n\\nButch was replaced on drums by Puddin\\'. In 2003, Eels embarked upon another big tour, called the Tour of Duty. The live band consisted of E, Goldenboy (guitar), Koool G Murder (bass) and Puddin\\' (drums). Later that year, E composed the score for the film Levity.\\n\\nBlinking Lights and Other Revelations and Eels with Strings\\nEels\\' next album, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, was released on April 26, 2005, and was the band\\'s first release for new label Vagrant Records. It is a 33-track double album. Contributions were made by Tom Waits, Peter Buck, John Sebastian (The Lovin\\' Spoonful), Jim Jacobsen, and Butch.\\n\\nThe first tour in support of the Blinking Lights album, billed as Eels with Strings, featured primarily performances by E on acoustic guitar, organ or piano, backed by Allen \"Big Al\" Hunter on piano and upright bass, Jeffrey Lyster (also known as Chet Atkins III or \"The Chet\") on guitar, mandolin, pedal steel, musical saw and drums, and a string quartet consisting of violinists Paloma Udovic and Julie Carpenter, violist Heather Lockie and cellist Ana Lenchantin. The tour resulted in a live album, Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall, recorded in New York City. The performance includes tracks from all of their albums, and was released on CD and DVD on February 21, 2006.\\n\\nMeet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I and Useless Trinkets\\nIn early 2008, Eels released their first \"greatest hits\" compilation as well as a compilation of B-sides, rarities, soundtrack singles and unreleased tracks. Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I spans the first decade of the Eels, including singles from all their albums, as well as a DVD featuring music videos and one live performance video. Useless Trinkets contains 50 B-sides and rarities and a DVD of their Lollapalooza 2006 performances. To promote the releases, the band went on a world tour, An Evening With Eels. This time, only the Chet joined E on stage, both playing a broad cross-section from the Eels repertoire on a variety of instruments. The concerts also featured the Chet reading excerpts from E\\'s 2008 autobiography, Things the Grandchildren Should Know. On this tour, the band released a live CD/DVD package of Eels\\' 2006 performance at the London Astoria, Live and in Person!, documenting a show from the second tour in support of Blinking Lights and Other Revelations.\\n\\nThe soundtrack of the 2008 comedy film Yes Man features nine songs by Eels, including \"Man Up\", a brand new song.\\n\\nConcept album trilogy: Hombre Lobo, End Times, and Tomorrow Morning\\nHombre Lobo, the seventh Eels studio album, was released on June 2, 2009. The album comprises twelve new songs. \"Hombre Lobo\" is Spanish for \"wolf man\" or \"werewolf\" and references E\\'s unusually long beard, which he originally grew when writing the song \"Dog Faced Boy\". On March 31, 2009, the band made the track \"Fresh Blood\" available on Spinner, explaining that the song would be the lead single for the album. A Jesse Dylan-directed music video was released on April 29, 2009 as well. The album was released as a single-disc CD and a deluxe edition with a DVD. In September 2009, Eels released a music video for \"That Look You Give That Guy\", featuring Bobby Jr., E and Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi.\\n\\nWhile promoting this album, Eels released the live EP The Myspace Transmissions Session 2009 on October 14, 2009. That same day, the band\\'s website announced that a new Eels album entitled End Times would be released on January 19, 2010. It was largely recorded on a four-track recorder and is based on the themes of broken love. Three album tracks—\"Little Bird\", \"In My Younger Days\", and \"A Line in the Dirt\"—were made available as music videos or promotional downloads prior to the release of the album. Once again, Butch contributed drums to \"A Line in the Dirt\". On January 19, 2010, End Times was released. E made no comment on touring and there was no tour scheduled to begin.\\n\\nA second album was announced on May 20, 2010: Tomorrow Morning was described as the \"final installment of a trilogy that began with Hombre Lobo and End Times.\" The three albums respectively explore themes of desire, loss, and redemption. A world tour, the first since 2007\\'s An Evening With Eels tour, was announced at the same time. This tour once again featured the Chet on various instruments, alongside Koool G Murder on bass, trilogy drummer Knuckles on drums and a new member, P-Boo, on guitar.\\n\\nWonderful, Glorious and The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett\\nOn February 5, 2013, the 10th Eels studio album was released, entitled Wonderful, Glorious. The first single from the album, \"Peach Blossom\", premiered on SoundCloud on November 6, 2012. A month later, on December 4, 2012, the official video was released on Stereogum. The second single, \"New Alphabet\", was streamed pre-release on December 12, 2012 on Spinner\\n\\nOn March 25, 2013, the band released a parody music video called \"Cold Dead Hand\" through Funny or Die, with Jim Carrey replacing E on vocals. The song and video, set as a musical act during the variety program Hee Haw, lampoons American gun culture, and specifically former NRA spokesperson Charlton Heston.\\n\\nEels\\' eleventh studio album, The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett, was released on April 21, 2014 on E Works Records. In April 2015, the band released the DVD and double live album Live at the Royal Albert Hall.\\n\\nIn 2015, Eels created their own version of Melanie De Biasio\\'s track \"I Feel You\" for the album Gilles Peterson Presents - No Deal Remixed. The track was later used to promote the 2017 film Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, and appears during the entire in-universe short movie Meet Walter starring Michael Fassbender.\\n\\nThe Deconstruction and Earth to Dora\\nOn January 17, 2018, Eels announced their 12th studio album, The Deconstruction, to be released on April 6, 2018, their first in nearly four years. They also announced a supporting tour throughout the United States and Europe, beginning in Pomona, California on May 28, 2018. The album travels through many styles sonically, but its lyrics primarily deal with rebuilding one\\'s life and looking back on what went wrong. Singles include (in release order) the title track, \"Today Is the Day\", \"Premonition\", and \"Bone Dry\". Styles present on the album include orchestral pop, power pop, psychedelic pop/rock, indie/alternative rock and post-modern pop.\\n\\nThe band\\'s next release was the single \"Baby Let\\'s Make It Real\"/\"Who You Say You Are\", announced on September 1, 2020. These songs were featured on the subsequent studio album, Earth to Dora (2020).\\n\\nExtreme Witchcraft\\nOn September 21, 2021, it was announced that the 14th Eels album would be called Extreme Witchcraft and would be released on January 28, 2022. The album was produced by E and John Parish in their first collaboration since 2001\\'s Souljacker.\\n\\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eels_(band)\\n\\nStudio albums\\nAs E\\nA Man Called E (1992)\\nBroken Toy Shop (1993)\\n\\nAs Eels\\nBeautiful Freak (1996)\\nElectro-Shock Blues (1998)\\nDaisies of the Galaxy (2000)\\nSouljacker (2001)\\nShootenanny!

      "biography_en": "Although Eels are often marketed as a full-fledged band, singer/songwriter E (real name: Mark Oliver Everett) is responsible for the group's sound and direction. Born in Virginia on April 9, 1963, Everett became interested in rock music at an early age via his sister's record collection, and began playing drums at the age of six (as well as tinkering on his family's piano). As the years progressed, Everett began leading a troubled teenage life, which was further complicated by his father's death. However, the turmoil led to an even stronger interest in music, as he taught himself how to play his sister's guitar and began writing his own original compositions. (Tragedy would later form the catalyst for Eels' magnum opus, Electro-Shock Blues.)\n\nDue to the fact that several of his friends also were named Mark, it was also around this time that Everett began going by his initials -- and eventually, solely by the letter \"E.\" By his early twenties, E was recording demo material on a used four-track cassette recorder, and eventually decided to pursue his rock & roll dreams by relocating to Los Angeles. Due to his prolific songwriting, the quality of his tunes naturally began to improve, which led to a recording contract as a solo artist for Polydor Records. This was followed by a pair of underappreciated releases, 1992's A Man Called E (which was supported with a tour opening for Tori Amos) and 1993's Broken Toy Shop, before E left the label and formed Eels along with bassist Tommy Walter and drummer Butch Norton. The trio inked a deal with the then-newly formed Dreamworks label and issued Eels' debut, 1996's Beautiful Freak. The album spawned a sizable MTV/alternative radio hit with \"Novocaine for the Soul,\" its promo clip received three MTV Video Music Award nominations the following year, and the group's popularity rose in England (resulting in a Brit Award, which was presented to the group by goof metallists Spinal Tap).\n\nWhat should have been a time of great promise for E turned out to be one of tragedy, as both the singer's sister and mother passed away in quick succession. This was compounded by Walter's departure from the group. The dark mood resonated in Eels' sophomore effort, Electro-Shock Blues, which proved to be stronger than its predecessor yet failed to fuel much commercial success. With new bassist Adam Siegal in tow, the group toured behind the album's release before returning to the studio immediately afterward to work on a third album. Issued in 2000, Daisies of the Galaxy offered a slightly brighter outlook and featured a guest appearance from R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck, who also helped co-pen a track. Despite the album's commercial failure, E put together \"the Eels Orchestra\" and launched an international tour in support of its release. The six-piece band featured saxophone, trombone, trumpet, banjo, guitar, violin, upright bass, piano, melodica, clarinet, and timpani -- to make it work on-stage, each bandmember was required to play three to four different instruments each night.\n\nAfter a live recording of the 2000 Eels Orchestra tour, Oh What a Beautiful Morning, was issued via the group's official website, E began preparing for Eels' fourth studio release. Instead of penning the entire album by himself (as he'd done with the group's previous work), E turned to John Parish for help. The two created Souljacker, which was issued throughout most of the world in September 2001 and hit American shores early the following year (in the U.S., the first edition of the CD also contained a bonus four-track disc). The resulting tour saw E and Norton joined by multi-instrumentalist Parish, as well as new bassist/synthesizer player Koool G Murder. A live disc, Electro-Shock Blues Show, followed soon after to promote the tour.\n \nSpring 2003 began a flurry of Eels/E-related releases, beginning with MC Honky and his SpinART release I Am the Messiah. While the man behind Messiah's splattering mix of hip-hop beats, dance grooves, and kitschy samples was little more than E in DJ drag, the album was nevertheless an enjoyable slice of summertime fun. E's score for the indie film Levity arrived in April, and June saw the release of the Eels' fifth studio album, Shootenanny! Its follow-up, 2005's Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, was an ambitious double album including 33 songs. Eels' With Strings: Live at Town Hall album, recorded June 30, 2005, documented the New York Town Hall performance during their 2005 tour of the same name, and another With Strings: Live at Town Hall edition was simultaneously issued in February 2006 with a concert DVD.\n \nIn 2008, Eels released two CD/DVD sets -- Meet the Eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1 and Useless Trinkets: B Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996-2007. The band's music also comprised the bulk of the soundtrack for Yes Man, a comedy featuring Jim Carrey. E then returned to the drawing board and emerged with Hombre Lobo, a concept album about desire that arrived in mid-2009, followed closely by the MySpace Transmissions Session 2009 live EP. The lo-fi End Times, which revolved around the central theme of broken love, arrived in 2010, but was followed in August by Tomorrow Morning, a much more polished album of upbeat optimism that relied heavily on analog electronics to drive its songs. In 2011 Eels issued Hombre Loco, End Times, and Tomorrow Morning as a box set entitled Trilogy with an accompanying DVD. Greg Prato, Rovi",

      "biography_fr": "Eels est un groupe de rock expérimental de Los Angeles (États-Unis) fondé en 1995 par le chanteur Mark Oliver Everett, auteur, compositeur, interprète et multiinstrumentiste ayant déjà enregistré deux albums en soliste sous le pseudonyme « E », précédemment à la formation du groupe.\n\nMark Everett choisit les musiciens qui l'entourent en fonction des besoins du moment, le seul point fixe étant Jonathan « Butch » Norton à la batterie. La première incarnation de Eels est en outre composée de Tommy Walters à la basse. Le succès international est immédiat dès la sortie du premier album, Beautiful Freak, en 1996, dont la pochette représente une fillette aux yeux démesurément écarquillés. C'est également le premier album édité par la nouvelle maison de disques créée par Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg et David Geffen : SKG. A l'image du tube alternatif Novocaine for the Soul ou encore de Susan's House et Mental, les trois musiciens de Eels mélangent des sonorités éthérées avec de la pop massive et celle d'un toy piano instrument préféré de E, employé à de nombreuses reprises dans ses albums solos (essentiellement Broken Toy Shop). La tendance est majoritairement aux ballades vaporeuses dépressives, comme Your lucky day in hell, Beautiful freak, Not ready yet et My beloved monster. Novocaine for the Soul et Susan's House sont des succès et le clip du premier sera sélectionné pour plusieurs MTV awards.\nParfois perçu comme un produit marketing à faible espérance de vie à la sortie de son premier opus, notamment à cause de la signature du label grand public Dreamworks, Eels se révèle au fil des albums un groupe alternatif, original et créatif. En 1997 et 1998, suite à une série de drames familiaux (le suicide de sa sœur Elizabeth en 1996 et le cancer du poumon qui emporta sa mère, Nancy) Everett écrit puis enregistre Electro-Shock Blues qui évoque ces événements difficiles. Cet album, plus ambitieux que le précédent, est influencé par le trip-hop. La quête de sonorités nouvelles y est développée, avec des textes plus intimes qui parlent de solitude et de tristesse. Malgré un succès commercial moins affirmé, le disque séduit son public et les clips des simples Last Stop: This Town et Cancer for the Cure sont de nouveau sélectionnés pour les MTV awards. L'album est par ailleurs considéré comme étant l'œuvre majeure de Eels.\nDaisies Of The Galaxy lui succède en 2000 et marque une évolution significative : les arrangements sont plus complexes et l'album plaît plus à la critique qu'au grand public. Ce disque-ci est gai et aborde des thèmes beaucoup plus légers, I like birds en tête. La tournée qui s'ensuit implique un orchestre étoffé de six musiciens jouant une grande variété d'instruments. Souljacker, sorti en 2001, voit un Mark Olivier Everett revenir transformé en rocker barbu et corrosif à souhait. Le disque déroute ses fans mais E reste fidèle à ses idées.\nShootenanny!, en 2003, est un album de blues, dans lequel E apparaît assagi, posé et solitaire. Enfin, le double album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations en 2005, salué par la critique, fait la synthèse des dernières périodes de Eels. La tournée qui suit voit E évoluer avec des musiciens classiques, dont quatre violons et une contrebasse, immortalisée sur l'album Eels With String Live At Town Hall ainsi que sur le dvd du même nom. Loin de l'agitation qui entoura ses débuts, Eels continue de construire une œuvre riche et prolifique dans le rock indépendant.\nAprès quelques années d'absence, Hombre Lobo, paraît en 2009. Retour au rock, avec de la saturation sur les voix et des textes toujours sombres.\nEn 2010, paraît End Times, avec cette fois-ci un folk très omniprésent tout au long de l'album. En 2010 paraît également Tomorrow Morning.\nEn février 2013, le groupe publie son dixième album, Wonderful, Glorious. Pour la première fois, le processus de création a été collectif.",

      "bio_content": "Eels (often typeset as eels or EELS) is an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1991 by singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Mark Oliver Everett, known by the stage name E. Band members have changed over the years, both in the studio and on stage, making Everett the only official member for most of the band's work. Eels' music is often filled with themes of family, death, and unrequited love. Since 1996, Eels has released fourteen studio albums, seven of which charted in the Billboard 200.\n\nHistory\nE solo records\nIn 1991, Everett signed a contract with Polydor and released A Man Called E under the name E a year later. The single \"Hello Cruel World\" was a minor success. Touring to support the album, E opened for Tori Amos. A Man Called E was followed by Broken Toy Shop in 1993. This year also marked the beginning of E's collaboration with drummer Jonathan \"Butch\" Norton. After Broken Toy Shop, E was released from his record deal with Polydor. E has performed two of the songs from Broken Toy Shop (\"The Only Thing I Care About\" and \"Manchester Girl\") for his own live shows with the Eels.\n\nBeautiful Freak\nEels were officially founded when Butch and E met Tommy Walter. The name \"Eels\" was chosen so that the band's records would be close to E's solo records in an alphabetical ordering, although it was too late once they realized that numerous Eagles and Earth, Wind & Fire releases were in between. Eels became one of the first groups to sign a record deal with DreamWorks Records, followed by Elliott Smith.\n\nIn 1996, the band released their debut album Beautiful Freak. The singles \"Novocaine for the Soul\", \"Susan's House\" and \"Your Lucky Day in Hell\" achieved modest national and international success, with the band winning the Best International Breakthrough Act award at the 1998 BRIT Awards. In 1996 and 1997, Eels toured extensively to support the album, building their name as a live act in the United States and Europe. In September 1997, Walter quit the band.\n\nReleased in May 2001, the motion picture soundtrack for the movie Shrek included the song \"My Beloved Monster\".\n\nElectro-Shock Blues\nFollowing the success of Beautiful Freak, E experienced a difficult time in his personal life. His sister committed suicide, and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. These events inspired Eels' second album, 1998's Electro-Shock Blues. The album deals with many difficult subjects, including cancer, mental illness, suicide and death. The tragedy of Everett's father's death became prominent once more in the context of his mother's impending death and his sister's suicide, and as a result the song \"Baby Genius\" is written for his father Hugh Everett III. Contributions to the album were made by Jon Brion, Lisa Germano, Jim Jacobsen, Grant-Lee Phillips, Dust Brother Michael Simpson, and T-Bone Burnett.\n\nThe single \"Last Stop: This Town\" saw minor success, while \"Cancer for the Cure\", the second single from the album, appeared on the soundtrack for American Beauty (1999).\n\nStill a three-piece band on stage, Tommy Walter was replaced by Adam Siegel. Part of the American leg of the tour was cancelled after the death of E's mother. They returned to tour Europe later in the year, to open for Pulp.\n\nDaisies of the Galaxy\nIn 2000, Eels released Daisies of the Galaxy. The album, which was recorded almost entirely in E's basement, is lighter and more upbeat than its predecessor. Everett noted, \"if Electro-Shock Blues was the phone call in the middle of the night that the world doesn't want to answer, then Daisies of the Galaxy is the hotel wake-up call that says your lovely breakfast is ready\". He was joined in the studio by Michael Simpson (Dust Brothers), Grant-Lee Phillips (Grant Lee Buffalo), and Peter Buck (R.E.M.).\n\nThe first single, \"Mr. E's Beautiful Blues\", was co-written by Simpson. The song was not intended to be on the album, but the record company insisted on its inclusion. Therefore, it was not featured on the track listing but was instead listed on the cover sticker as a bonus track, separated from the rest of the album by 20 seconds of silence.\n\nTo promote Daisies of the Galaxy, another tour took place across the United States and Europe, with the band also playing their first concerts in Australia. For these performances, Eels were transformed into a 6-piece orchestra, including Lisa Germano and Probyn Gregory. E also played some solo shows, opening for Fiona Apple.\n\nSouljacker and Shootenanny!\nIn 2001, Souljacker was released, an album with a heavier feel and more rock-oriented sound than Daisies of the Galaxy. John Parish, previously of PJ Harvey's band, co-wrote most of the songs and played guitar on the album and first part of the tour. After Parish became a father, he was replaced with Joe Gore for the American leg of the Bus Driving, Band Rocking Tour. Koool G Murder played bass and keyboards and joined Eels on tour.\n\n2003 marked the release of the album Shootenanny!. E now refers to the album as a break from recording the following Blinking Lights album. It was recorded live in the studio in only ten days. \"Saturday Morning\" was released as a single.\n\nButch was replaced on drums by Puddin'. In 2003, Eels embarked upon another big tour, called the Tour of Duty. The live band consisted of E, Goldenboy (guitar), Koool G Murder (bass) and Puddin' (drums). Later that year, E composed the score for the film Levity.\n\nBlinking Lights and Other Revelations and Eels with Strings\nEels' next album, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, was released on April 26, 2005, and was the band's first release for new label Vagrant Records. It is a 33-track double album. Contributions were made by Tom Waits, Peter Buck, John Sebastian (The Lovin' Spoonful), Jim Jacobsen, and Butch.\n\nThe first tour in support of the Blinking Lights album, billed as Eels with Strings, featured primarily performances by E on acoustic guitar, organ or piano, backed by Allen \"Big Al\" Hunter on piano and upright bass, Jeffrey Lyster (also known as Chet Atkins III or \"The Chet\") on guitar, mandolin, pedal steel, musical saw and drums, and a string quartet consisting of violinists Paloma Udovic and Julie Carpenter, violist Heather Lockie and cellist Ana Lenchantin. The tour resulted in a live album, Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall, recorded in New York City. The performance includes tracks from all of their albums, and was released on CD and DVD on February 21, 2006.\n\nMeet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I and Useless Trinkets\nIn early 2008, Eels released their first \"greatest hits\" compilation as well as a compilation of B-sides, rarities, soundtrack singles and unreleased tracks. Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I spans the first decade of the Eels, including singles from all their albums, as well as a DVD featuring music videos and one live performance video. Useless Trinkets contains 50 B-sides and rarities and a DVD of their Lollapalooza 2006 performances. To promote the releases, the band went on a world tour, An Evening With Eels. This time, only the Chet joined E on stage, both playing a broad cross-section from the Eels repertoire on a variety of instruments. The concerts also featured the Chet reading excerpts from E's 2008 autobiography, Things the Grandchildren Should Know. On this tour, the band released a live CD/DVD package of Eels' 2006 performance at the London Astoria, Live and in Person!, documenting a show from the second tour in support of Blinking Lights and Other Revelations.\n\nThe soundtrack of the 2008 comedy film Yes Man features nine songs by Eels, including \"Man Up\", a brand new song.\n\nConcept album trilogy: Hombre Lobo, End Times, and Tomorrow Morning\nHombre Lobo, the seventh Eels studio album, was released on June 2, 2009. The album comprises twelve new songs. \"Hombre Lobo\" is Spanish for \"wolf man\" or \"werewolf\" and references E's unusually long beard, which he originally grew when writing the song \"Dog Faced Boy\". On March 31, 2009, the band made the track \"Fresh Blood\" available on Spinner, explaining that the song would be the lead single for the album. A Jesse Dylan-directed music video was released on April 29, 2009 as well. The album was released as a single-disc CD and a deluxe edition with a DVD. In September 2009, Eels released a music video for \"That Look You Give That Guy\", featuring Bobby Jr., E and Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi.\n\nWhile promoting this album, Eels released the live EP The Myspace Transmissions Session 2009 on October 14, 2009. That same day, the band's website announced that a new Eels album entitled End Times would be released on January 19, 2010. It was largely recorded on a four-track recorder and is based on the themes of broken love. Three album tracks—\"Little Bird\", \"In My Younger Days\", and \"A Line in the Dirt\"—were made available as music videos or promotional downloads prior to the release of the album. Once again, Butch contributed drums to \"A Line in the Dirt\". On January 19, 2010, End Times was released. E made no comment on touring and there was no tour scheduled to begin.\n\nA second album was announced on May 20, 2010: Tomorrow Morning was described as the \"final installment of a trilogy that began with Hombre Lobo and End Times.\" The three albums respectively explore themes of desire, loss, and redemption. A world tour, the first since 2007's An Evening With Eels tour, was announced at the same time. This tour once again featured the Chet on various instruments, alongside Koool G Murder on bass, trilogy drummer Knuckles on drums and a new member, P-Boo, on guitar.\n\nWonderful, Glorious and The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett\nOn February 5, 2013, the 10th Eels studio album was released, entitled Wonderful, Glorious. The first single from the album, \"Peach Blossom\", premiered on SoundCloud on November 6, 2012. A month later, on December 4, 2012, the official video was released on Stereogum. The second single, \"New Alphabet\", was streamed pre-release on December 12, 2012 on Spinner\n\nOn March 25, 2013, the band released a parody music video called \"Cold Dead Hand\" through Funny or Die, with Jim Carrey replacing E on vocals. The song and video, set as a musical act during the variety program Hee Haw, lampoons American gun culture, and specifically former NRA spokesperson Charlton Heston.\n\nEels' eleventh studio album, The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett, was released on April 21, 2014 on E Works Records. In April 2015, the band released the DVD and double live album Live at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nIn 2015, Eels created their own version of Melanie De Biasio's track \"I Feel You\" for the album Gilles Peterson Presents - No Deal Remixed. The track was later used to promote the 2017 film Alien: Covenant, directed by Ridley Scott, and appears during the entire in-universe short movie Meet Walter starring Michael Fassbender.\n\nThe Deconstruction and Earth to Dora\nOn January 17, 2018, Eels announced their 12th studio album, The Deconstruction, to be released on April 6, 2018, their first in nearly four years. They also announced a supporting tour throughout the United States and Europe, beginning in Pomona, California on May 28, 2018. The album travels through many styles sonically, but its lyrics primarily deal with rebuilding one's life and looking back on what went wrong. Singles include (in release order) the title track, \"Today Is the Day\", \"Premonition\", and \"Bone Dry\". Styles present on the album include orchestral pop, power pop, psychedelic pop/rock, indie/alternative rock and post-modern pop.\n\nThe band's next release was the single \"Baby Let's Make It Real\"/\"Who You Say You Are\", announced on September 1, 2020. These songs were featured on the subsequent studio album, Earth to Dora (2020).\n\nExtreme Witchcraft\nOn September 21, 2021, it was announced that the 14th Eels album would be called Extreme Witchcraft and would be released on January 28, 2022. The album was produced by E and John Parish in their first collaboration since 2001's Souljacker.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eels_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nAs E\nA Man Called E (1992)\nBroken Toy Shop (1993)\n\nAs Eels\nBeautiful Freak (1996)\nElectro-Shock Blues (1998)\nDaisies of the Galaxy (2000)\nSouljacker (2001)\nShootenanny!

      "biography_en": "Although Eels are often marketed as a full-fledged band, singer/songwriter E (real name: Mark Oliver Everett) is responsible for the group's sound and direction. Born in Virginia on April 9, 1963, Everett became interested in rock music at an early age via his sister's record collection, and began playing drums at the age of six (as well as tinkering on his family's piano). As the years progressed, Everett began leading a troubled teenage life, which was further complicated by his father's death. However, the turmoil led to an even stronger interest in music, as he taught himself how to play his sister's guitar and began writing his own original compositions. (Tragedy would later form the catalyst for Eels' magnum opus, Electro-Shock Blues.)\n\nDue to the fact that several of his friends also were named Mark, it was also around this time that Everett began going by his initials -- and eventually, solely by the letter \"E.\" By his early twenties, E was recording demo material on a used four-track cassette recorder, and eventually decided to pursue his rock & roll dreams by relocating to Los Angeles. Due to his prolific songwriting, the quality of his tunes naturally began to improve, which led to a recording contract as a solo artist for Polydor Records. This was followed by a pair of underappreciated releases, 1992's A Man Called E (which was supported with a tour opening for Tori Amos) and 1993's Broken Toy Shop, before E left the label and formed Eels along with bassist Tommy Walter and drummer Butch Norton. The trio inked a deal with the then-newly formed Dreamworks label and issued Eels' debut, 1996's Beautiful Freak. The album spawned a sizable MTV/alternative radio hit with \"Novocaine for the Soul,\" its promo clip received three MTV Video Music Award nominations the following year, and the group's popularity rose in England (resulting in a Brit Award, which was presented to the group by goof metallists Spinal Tap).\n\nWhat should have been a time of great promise for E turned out to be one of tragedy, as both the singer's sister and mother passed away in quick succession. This was compounded by Walter's departure from the group. The dark mood resonated in Eels' sophomore effort, Electro-Shock Blues, which proved to be stronger than its predecessor yet failed to fuel much commercial success. With new bassist Adam Siegal in tow, the group toured behind the album's release before returning to the studio immediately afterward to work on a third album. Issued in 2000, Daisies of the Galaxy offered a slightly brighter outlook and featured a guest appearance from R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck, who also helped co-pen a track. Despite the album's commercial failure, E put together \"the Eels Orchestra\" and launched an international tour in support of its release. The six-piece band featured saxophone, trombone, trumpet, banjo, guitar, violin, upright bass, piano, melodica, clarinet, and timpani -- to make it work on-stage, each bandmember was required to play three to four different instruments each night.\n\nAfter a live recording of the 2000 Eels Orchestra tour, Oh What a Beautiful Morning, was issued via the group's official website, E began preparing for Eels' fourth studio release. Instead of penning the entire album by himself (as he'd done with the group's previous work), E turned to John Parish for help. The two created Souljacker, which was issued throughout most of the world in September 2001 and hit American shores early the following year (in the U.S., the first edition of the CD also contained a bonus four-track disc). The resulting tour saw E and Norton joined by multi-instrumentalist Parish, as well as new bassist/synthesizer player Koool G Murder. A live disc, Electro-Shock Blues Show, followed soon after to promote the tour.\n \nSpring 2003 began a flurry of Eels/E-related releases, beginning with MC Honky and his SpinART release I Am the Messiah. While the man behind Messiah's splattering mix of hip-hop beats, dance grooves, and kitschy samples was little more than E in DJ drag, the album was nevertheless an enjoyable slice of summertime fun. E's score for the indie film Levity arrived in April, and June saw the release of the Eels' fifth studio album, Shootenanny! Its follow-up, 2005's Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, was an ambitious double album including 33 songs. Eels' With Strings: Live at Town Hall album, recorded June 30, 2005, documented the New York Town Hall performance during their 2005 tour of the same name, and another With Strings: Live at Town Hall edition was simultaneously issued in February 2006 with a concert DVD.\n \nIn 2008, Eels released two CD/DVD sets -- Meet the Eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1 and Useless Trinkets: B Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996-2007. The band's music also comprised the bulk of the soundtrack for Yes Man, a comedy featuring Jim Carrey. E then returned to the drawing board and emerged with Hombre Lobo, a concept album about desire that arrived in mid-2009, followed closely by the MySpace Transmissions Session 2009 live EP. The lo-fi End Times, which revolved around the central theme of broken love, arrived in 2010, but was followed in August by Tomorrow Morning, a much more polished album of upbeat optimism that relied heavily on analog electronics to drive its songs. In 2011 Eels issued Hombre Loco, End Times, and Tomorrow Morning as a box set entitled Trilogy with an accompanying DVD. Greg Prato, Rovi",

      "biography_fr": "Eels est un groupe de rock expérimental de Los Angeles (États-Unis) fondé en 1995 par le chanteur Mark Oliver Everett, auteur, compositeur, interprète et multiinstrumentiste ayant déjà enregistré deux albums en soliste sous le pseudonyme « E », précédemment à la formation du groupe.\n\nMark Everett choisit les musiciens qui l'entourent en fonction des besoins du moment, le seul point fixe étant Jonathan « Butch » Norton à la batterie. La première incarnation de Eels est en outre composée de Tommy Walters à la basse. Le succès international est immédiat dès la sortie du premier album, Beautiful Freak, en 1996, dont la pochette représente une fillette aux yeux démesurément écarquillés. C'est également le premier album édité par la nouvelle maison de disques créée par Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg et David Geffen : SKG. A l'image du tube alternatif Novocaine for the Soul ou encore de Susan's House et Mental, les trois musiciens de Eels mélangent des sonorités éthérées avec de la pop massive et celle d'un toy piano instrument préféré de E, employé à de nombreuses reprises dans ses albums solos (essentiellement Broken Toy Shop). La tendance est majoritairement aux ballades vaporeuses dépressives, comme Your lucky day in hell, Beautiful freak, Not ready yet et My beloved monster. Novocaine for the Soul et Susan's House sont des succès et le clip du premier sera sélectionné pour plusieurs MTV awards.\nParfois perçu comme un produit marketing à faible espérance de vie à la sortie de son premier opus, notamment à cause de la signature du label grand public Dreamworks, Eels se révèle au fil des albums un groupe alternatif, original et créatif. En 1997 et 1998, suite à une série de drames familiaux (le suicide de sa sœur Elizabeth en 1996 et le cancer du poumon qui emporta sa mère, Nancy) Everett écrit puis enregistre Electro-Shock Blues qui évoque ces événements difficiles. Cet album, plus ambitieux que le précédent, est influencé par le trip-hop. La quête de sonorités nouvelles y est développée, avec des textes plus intimes qui parlent de solitude et de tristesse. Malgré un succès commercial moins affirmé, le disque séduit son public et les clips des simples Last Stop: This Town et Cancer for the Cure sont de nouveau sélectionnés pour les MTV awards. L'album est par ailleurs considéré comme étant l'œuvre majeure de Eels.\nDaisies Of The Galaxy lui succède en 2000 et marque une évolution significative : les arrangements sont plus complexes et l'album plaît plus à la critique qu'au grand public. Ce disque-ci est gai et aborde des thèmes beaucoup plus légers, I like birds en tête. La tournée qui s'ensuit implique un orchestre étoffé de six musiciens jouant une grande variété d'instruments. Souljacker, sorti en 2001, voit un Mark Olivier Everett revenir transformé en rocker barbu et corrosif à souhait. Le disque déroute ses fans mais E reste fidèle à ses idées.\nShootenanny!, en 2003, est un album de blues, dans lequel E apparaît assagi, posé et solitaire. Enfin, le double album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations en 2005, salué par la critique, fait la synthèse des dernières périodes de Eels. La tournée qui suit voit E évoluer avec des musiciens classiques, dont quatre violons et une contrebasse, immortalisée sur l'album Eels With String Live At Town Hall ainsi que sur le dvd du même nom. Loin de l'agitation qui entoura ses débuts, Eels continue de construire une œuvre riche et prolifique dans le rock indépendant.\nAprès quelques années d'absence, Hombre Lobo, paraît en 2009. Retour au rock, avec de la saturation sur les voix et des textes toujours sombres.\nEn 2010, paraît End Times, avec cette fois-ci un folk très omniprésent tout au long de l'album. En 2010 paraît également Tomorrow Morning.\nEn février 2013, le groupe publie son dixième album, Wonderful, Glorious. Pour la première fois, le processus de création a été collectif.",
