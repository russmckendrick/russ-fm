      "biography": "The Prodigy is an English electronic music group from Braintree, Essex, formed by Liam Howlett in 1990. The current members include Liam Howlett (keyboardist and composer), Keith Flint (dancer and vocalist) and Maxim (MC and vocalist). Leeroy Thornhill (dancer and occasional live keyboardist) was a member of the band from 1990 to 2000, as was a female dancer and vocalist called Sharky who left the group during their early period.\n\nAlong with The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method and other acts, The Prodigy have been credited as pioneers of the big beat genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s. They have sold over 25 million records worldwide. The group has won numerous music awards throughout their career, including two Brit Awards—winning Best British Dance Act twice, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Kerrang! Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards, and have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards.\n\nThe group's brand of music makes use of various styles ranging from rave, hardcore techno, electro-industrial, jungle and breakbeat in the early 1990s to big beat and electronic rock with punk vocal elements in later times. The Prodigy first emerged on the underground rave scene in the early 1990s and have since achieved popularity and worldwide renown. They have been called \"the premiere dance act for the alternative masses\" and \"the Godfathers of Rave\".\n\nMusical style and influences\nAlong with the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, and other acts, the Prodigy have been credited as pioneers of the big beat genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. The Prodigy are also considered alternative dance, techno, electronica, breakbeat hardcore, and rave.\n\nLiam Howlett cited early electro as a big influence, mentioning tunes like \"Clear\" by American music group Cybotron and \"Al Naafiysh\" by Hashim. Liam Howlett also cited The Bomb Squad, Public Enemy, and Rage Against the Machine as influences.",

The album was released by XL Recordings on June 30, 1997 (and on July 1, 1997 in the U.S.).\n\nThe album caused some controversy in the UK. The video for the first single, \"Firestarter\", caused a minor uproar because of vocalist Keith Flint's appearance, and several people objected to the seeming misogyny of \"Smack My Bitch Up\", though the band maintains that its true interpretation is \"...doing anything intensely...\"\n\n\"Mindfields\" later appeared on the soundtrack of the film The Matrix, while \"Smack My Bitch Up\" has appeared in both Charlie's Angels and Closer. \"Funky Shit\" appeared in the trailers for the film Event Horizon and also played over the end credits.\n\n\"Serial Thrilla\" features a sample of a riff by Skunk Anansie, \"Funky Shit\" features a sample from \"Root Down\" from the Beastie Boys album Ill Communication, \"Fuel My Fire\" is a cover of an L7 song from Hungry for Stink. \"Smack My Bitch Up\" takes a sample from an Ultramagnetic MCs song, \"Give the Drummer Some\", and thus the Prodigy invited Kool Keith to do the lyrics and vocals for another track, \"Diesel Power.\" Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who is falsely credited as \"Mark\" in the liner notes, is also understood to have contributed samples to the album, though it is not clear where.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The album has since gone double platinum selling over 2 million copies in the U.S.\n\nThe album entered the Guinness World Records as the fastest-selling UK album in 1999 and was also nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nThe album was nominated for the 1997 Mercury Music Prize.\n\nIn 1998 Q magazine readers voted The Fat of the Land the ninth greatest album of all time.
