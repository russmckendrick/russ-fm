      "biography": "XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.\n\nPartridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and avant-garde. The single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" (1980) and \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982). After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding and guitarist Dave Gregory. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking (1986), Oranges & Lemons (1989) and Nonsuch (1992). In the US, \"Mayor of Simpleton\" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while \"Dear God\" (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.\n\nDue to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of Apple Venus Volume 1 (1999), after which the XTC name briefly served as a banner for what were effectively solo efforts by Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC \"in the past tense\". Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC&I in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active.",

      "biography": "The Dukes of Stratosphear were an English rock band formed in 1984 by Andy Partridge, Colin Moulding, Dave Gregory, and Ian Gregory. Modeled after psychedelic pop groups from the 1960s, the Dukes were initially publicised by Virgin Records as a mysterious new act, but were actually an XTC spin-off band. The project amounted to the albums 25 O'Clock (1985) and Psonic Psunspot (1987). In the UK, the records outsold XTC's then-current albums The Big Express (1984) and Skylarking (1986).\n\nThe band released two records under this pseudonym, the mini-album 25 O'Clock (1985), and the full-length album Psonic Psunspot (1987). The two releases were compiled onto a single CD under the title Chips from the Chocolate Fireball: An Anthology, which was released simultaneously with the vinyl issue of Psonic Psunspot. The Dukes were also mentioned in the credits of XTC's 1986 album Skylarking, where they were thanked for the loan of their guitars.\nIn 1991, Andy Partridge produced two tracks, \"It's Snowing Angels\" and \"Then She Appeared\", intended to be released as a hoax flexidisc attached to the cover of Strange Things Are Happening magazine. Although credited to fictional bands \"Big Chief Cigar Choc Champion\" and \"The Golden\", these tracks were a continuation of the Dukes recorded oeuvre in all but name. The magazine folded before the single could be pressed, although \"Then She Appeared\" would later be reworked for the Nonsuch album. \"It's Snowing Angels\" was released in 1994 via John Flansburgh's Hello Recording Club, and both tracks were included on the Fuzzy Warbles anthology.\nSeveral sequels were proposed but ultimately abandoned, including the mock rock opera The Great Royal Jelly Scandal, an animated feature film of 25 O'Clock, a 'prequel' album as \"The Mersey Dukes\", and a glam rock parody as \"The Stratosphear Band\". In 1992, XTC proposed a spiritual successor to the Dukes in the form of The Bubblegum Album, a compilation of mocked-up one-hit-wonder 1970s pop singles. The album was half completed but rejected by Virgin. This rejection was one of the main contributing factors to the seven-year feud between the band and Virgin. Several of these tracks were reworked and released on various XTC albums and compilations.\nThe 2002 XTC rarities compilation Coat of Many Cupboards, premiered a hitherto unheard 20-second section of narration recorded for Psonic Psunspot but not used. This does not appear on any other XTC/Dukes release.\nThe band briefly reformed in 2003, to record the track \"Open a Can (Of Human Beans)\" for the MS Society charity compilation album The Wish List. This track later reappeared on the Fuzzy Warbles anthology and the re-release of 25 O'Clock.\nIn 2008, Partridge recorded a promotional single for Eurostar as The Dukes - \"Tin Toy Clockwork Train\" - which was given away free at railway stations. This, and a rejected earlier attempt - \"Black Jewelled Serpent of Sound\" - were added to 25 O'Clock for its 2009 re-release.\nOn 20 April 2009, both records were released on CD for the first time in their own right - along with demo recordings, bonus tracks and brand new sleeve notes from the band. These editions are credited to \"XTC as The Dukes of Stratosphear\" and were released on Andy Partridge's Ape House record label (they are also the first XTC recordings to which Virgin Records have relinquished the rights).",
