  "biography": "Helmet is an alternative metal band hailing from New York City, with its roots dating back to 1989 when vocalist and lead guitarist Page Hamilton established the group. Throughout its existence, Helmet has undergone numerous lineup changes, yet Hamilton remains the sole consistent member. Since 2010, the band has been comprised of Hamilton, drummer Kyle Stevenson, guitarist Dan Beeman, and bassist Dave Case.\n\nThe discography of Helmet boasts eight studio albums and two compilation albums. Following their initial release, \"Strap It On\" (1990), through Amphetamine Reptile, Helmet inked a deal with Interscope Records, leading to three albums under the label, notably the highly successful \"Meantime\" (1992). While their subsequent works, \"Betty\" (1994) and \"Aftertaste\" (1997), achieved considerable success, they fell short of matching the critical and popular acclaim garnered by \"Meantime.\" After disbanding in 1998, Helmet regrouped in 2004 and has since presented four additional albums: \"Size Matters\" (2004), \"Monochrome\" (2006), \"Seeing Eye Dog\" (2010), and \"Dead to the World\" (2016). Currently, the band is actively engaged in the creation of their ninth studio album.\n\nDiscography\nStrap It On (1990)\nMeantime (1992)\nBetty (1994)\nAftertaste (1997)\nSize Matters (2004)\nMonochrome (2006)\nSeeing Eye Dog (2010)\nDead to the World (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Helmet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
