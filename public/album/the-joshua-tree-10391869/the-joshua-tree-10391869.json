      "biography": "U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976. The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.\n\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, War (1983), and singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, The Unforgettable Fire (1984), was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, whose influence resulted in the band experimenting with a more abstract, ambient sound. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Their fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date: \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\".\n\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album, Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991) and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on their eighth album, Zooropa (1993), and concluded following their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Although their twelfth album, No Line on the Horizon (2009), did not meet commercial expectations, their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour, both of which stood until 2019. In the 2010s, U2 released the companion albums Songs of Innocence (2014) and Songs of Experience (2017), the former of which received criticism for its pervasive, no-cost release through the iTunes Store. Their most recent album, Songs of Surrender (2023), consists of reimagined versions of 40 songs from their career.\n\nU2 have released 15 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, working with organisations and coalitions that include Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, DATA/the ONE Campaign, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.",

Too many mistakes, he thought, too many wrong moves. He’d had this feeling before, of course—he later said he couldn’t figure out why anyone would even <i>buy</i> a U2 album. But the stakes were higher now: They’d already been crowned Band of the ’80s by <i>Rolling Stone</i> (in 1985, no less), and their live shows had become the kind of spectacles that inspired rapture.<br />\nAdd to this the anxiety that <i>The Joshua Tree</i> represented something new for the band: the gospel influences, the emotional nakedness, the introduction of understatement to a sound that had defined itself by its forthrightness. In the past, they’d let their songwriting be loose and in-the-moment—after all, planning would’ve been unpunk. Now they were exploring the liberations that come with constraint. Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders had told Bono he had an amazing voice. But if he was going to sing the way he was capable of singing—the way he so obviously wanted to sing—he’d have to buckle down and write words he really believed in.<br />\nIf you lean in close, you can pull apart the sound in layers: the wisps of guitar, the bits of pocket-watch percussion (“One Tree Hill”). But if you sit back, it sounds minimal and direct. The words point to romantic love (“With or Without You”, “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For”) but also to the search for God and meaning—a reflection of the dualities they found in both gospel and the romanticism of Van Morrison and Patti Smith. The backdrop—the inky washes of sound, courtesy of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois—captures constant change, but the foreground—the march-like rhythms, the impassioned vocals—is steadfast and firm. They rock with the tools of their era, but they also tap into something eternal.<br />\nThe album’s original title was <i>The Two Americas</i>. But the spirit of travel and adventure remains, as does the spirit of being lost in a strange place and soaking in the beauty of the unknown. <i>The Joshua Tree</i> is the sound of the quest that leaves you transformed. ",

            "content": "\"The Joshua Tree\" is the fifth studio album by Irish rock band U2, released March 9, 1987 on Island Records. Recording sessions took place from July to November of 1986 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin. The album features the band's exploration of roots rock, with their music exhibiting influences from blues-rock, folk rock, Southern rock, and gospel music. Lyrically, \"The Joshua Tree\" depicts the band's fascination with America and many of the ideas it stands for. The album was produced and engineered by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.\n\nThe album increased the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars,\" according to Rolling Stone. The album produced several hit singles, including \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", \"With or Without You\", and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", all of which remain radio staples. \"The Joshua Tree\" won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Album of the Year in Grammy Awards of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album is one of the world's best-selling albums of all-time, having sold over 28 million copies. In 2007, a remastered version of the album was released to mark the 20th anniversary of its original release.\n\nFollowing \"The Unforgettable Fire\" album, U2 realised that they \"had no tradition, we were from outer space\", and they explored American blues, country and gospel music. Since that album, they had spent time with fellow Irish bands The Waterboys and Hothouse Flowers, and felt a sense of indigenous Irish music being blended with American folk music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Keith Richards encouraged the band to look back to the roots of rock music, and focused Bono on his skills as a song and lyric writer. The band wanted to build on \"The \"Unforgettable Fire\"'s atmospherics, but also sought a more hard-hitting sound within the strict discipline of more conventional song structures, in contrast to \"The Unforgettable Fire\"'s often out-of-focus experimentation.\n\nThe band interrupted their 1986 album sessions to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope Tour. Rather than being a distraction, the band found the tour added extra intensity and power to their new music, providing extra focus on what they wanted to say. The album sessions for \"The Joshua Tree\" proper began in July 1986 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin.\n\nIn his earlier 1986 travels to Central America, Bono saw first hand the distress of peasants bullied in political conflicts, and this was a central influence on the album. The United States' military intervention in El Salvador angered Bono and prompted him to ask The Edge to \"put El Salvador through an amplifier\" for the song \"Bullet the Blue Sky\". \"Mothers of the Disappeared\" was inspired by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the mothers of the thousands of \"disappeared\" people who opposed the Videla and Galtieri coup d'état that overtook Argentina in 1976, and who were kidnapped and never seen again.\n\nThe album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States, including anger at United States foreign policy in Central America, against the band's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom and what it stood for. The band wanted music with a sense of location, a 'cinematic' quality; its music and lyrics drew on imagery created by American writers the band had been reading. The band had toured in the United States extensively, which affected the band; according to Bono, the album was inspired and influenced more by the country's geography, rather than its people. Bono said he \"...had to 'deal with' the United States and the way it was affecting me, because the United States' having such an effect on the world at the moment. On this record I had to deal with it on a political level for the first time, if in a subtle way.\" Since Bono was trying to portray the both \"mythic idea of America\" and the \"reality of America\" on the album, the working title of the album was \"The Two Americas\".\n\nThe record was also influenced by the blues. While in recording sessions for the b-side \"Silver and Gold\", working with Keith Richards, Bono and Richards listened to blues music, country music, American pop music from the 1950s, and other such influences. These influences, combined with Bono's early influences, such as Patti Smith and Bob Dylan, had an effect on the song and the whole album.\n\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was conceived prior to one of the \"Joshua Tree\" recording sessions by guitarist The Edge. Bono conceived the lyrics with the idea that one could determine a person's religion and income based on where they lived in Belfast. While recording the song as a band, however, U2 ran into difficulty. The song's frequent chord and time changes caused problems in playing the song correctly; the difficulty was so great that producer Brian Eno attempted to erase the track. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. later said of the song, \"It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live.\"\n\n\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" grew from another song called \"Under the Weather Girls\", which co-producer Daniel Lanois didn't like, except for Larry Mullen, Jr.'s drum track and Adam Clayton's bass line. These parts were used as the foundation of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\". The development of the song saw the addition of such things as a subtle auto-pan effect added to one of The Edge's guitar overdubs and Bono, a tenor, singing in the upper register of his range to add to the feeling of spiritual yearning. Both Bono and Edge have, in fact, called it a gospel song on numerous occasions.\n\n\"With or Without You\", the album's first single and one of the band's most well-known songs, uses an effect called \"infinite guitar\", developed by Michael Brook, to infinitely sustain notes.\n\nThe band concluded recording of the album in November 1986.\n\nA number of songs that were released as B-sides to singles from \"The Joshua Tree\" are thought to have been considered for a double-album version of The Joshua Tree. Though Bono was the most vocal proponent of this extended version of the album, The Edge successfully argued for the 11-track version that was ultimately released. \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"Deep in the Heart\" were released as B-sides to the \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" single. \"Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)\" and \"Walk to the Water\" were released as B-sides to the \"With or Without You\" single. \"Sweetest Thing\", \"Silver and Gold\", and \"Race Against Time\" were released as B-sides to the \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" single.\n\n\"The Joshua Tree\" was first released on 9 March 1987. The album cover photo was taken by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn in December 1986. Corbijn later recounted the photo shoot in Death Valley, California; \"This is the most serious set of shots I have taken of U2 and they became my most well-known photographs at the time. It was taken with a panoramic camera to take more of the landscapes in which was the main idea of the shoot: man and environment, the Irish in America.\"\n\nIn 2007, a 20th anniversary edition of the album was released, featuring remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Four different formats of the remaster were made available.\n\n\"With or Without You\" and the rhythmic gospel \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" were released as singles internationally and quickly went to #1 in the U.S. \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was also successfully released. \"In God's Country\" was released as a fourth single in North America with modest success, while \"One Tree Hill\" was released as a fourth single in Australia and New Zealand. Initially slated as a single release, \"Red Hill Mining Town\" was the only track from the album not played on the tour. Bono has suggested that the song's high notes put too much strain on his voice.\n\nUpon its release, \"The Joshua Tree\" debuted at #1 in the UK and also quickly reached the top of the charts in the U.S. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine (following The Beatles, The Band, and The Who), who declared that U2 was \"Rock's Hottest Ticket\". The album brought U2 to a new level of mega-stardom, as the worldwide Joshua Tree Tour sold out arenas and stadiums around the world, the first time the band had consistently played venues of that size.\n\n\"The Joshua Tree\" won U2 their first two Grammy Awards, with the band receiving honors for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal\".\n\nAccording to U.S. Recording Industry sales figures, as of January 2005, \"The Joshua Tree\" ranks as the 89th best-selling album of all-time in the U.S. and, as of 2006, the 26th best-selling album in the U.K.. The album has sold 10 million copies in the United States alone and more than 25 million copies worldwide. It remains the band's best-selling album.\n\n\"The Joshua Tree\" is often cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In 1989, it was rated #3 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's\", as well as appearing at #26 on the magazine's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The Definitive 200 list sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ranks the album as the fifth-greatest in history. \"The Joshua Tree\" was selected as #6 on CCM Magazine's 2001 list of the greatest Contemporary Christian music albums of all time (see CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music). It came second place in Channel 4's 100 Greatest albums. It came in at #10 on ABC Television's My Favourite Album program, which aired in Australia in December 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Joshua+Tree\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bono conceived the lyrics with the idea that one could determine a person's religion and income based on where they lived in Belfast. While recording the song as a band, however, U2 ran into difficulty. The song's frequent chord and time changes caused problems in playing the song correctly; the difficulty was so great that producer Brian Eno attempted to erase the track. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. later said of the song, \"It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live.\"\n\n\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" grew from another song called \"Under the Weather Girls\", which co-producer Daniel Lanois didn't like, except for Larry Mullen, Jr.'s drum track and Adam Clayton's bass line. These parts were used as the foundation of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\". The development of the song saw the addition of such things as a subtle auto-pan effect added to one of The Edge's guitar overdubs and Bono, a tenor, singing in the upper register of his range to add to the feeling of spiritual yearning. Both Bono and Edge have, in fact, called it a gospel song on numerous occasions.\n\n\"With or Without You\", the album's first single and one of the band's most well-known songs, uses an effect called \"infinite guitar\", developed by Michael Brook, to infinitely sustain notes.\n\nThe band concluded recording of the album in November 1986.\n\nA number of songs that were released as B-sides to singles from \"The Joshua Tree\" are thought to have been considered for a double-album version of The Joshua Tree. Though Bono was the most vocal proponent of this extended version of the album, The Edge successfully argued for the 11-track version that was ultimately released. \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"Deep in the Heart\" were released as B-sides to the \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" single. \"Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)\" and \"Walk to the Water\" were released as B-sides to the \"With or Without You\" single. \"Sweetest Thing\", \"Silver and Gold\", and \"Race Against Time\" were released as B-sides to the \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" single.\n\n\"The Joshua Tree\" was first released on 9 March 1987. The album cover photo was taken by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn in December 1986. Corbijn later recounted the photo shoot in Death Valley, California; \"This is the most serious set of shots I have taken of U2 and they became my most well-known photographs at the time. It was taken with a panoramic camera to take more of the landscapes in which was the main idea of the shoot: man and environment, the Irish in America.\"\n\nIn 2007, a 20th anniversary edition of the album was released, featuring remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Four different formats of the remaster were made available.\n\n\"With or Without You\" and the rhythmic gospel \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" were released as singles internationally and quickly went to #1 in the U.S. \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was also successfully released. \"In God's Country\" was released as a fourth single in North America with modest success, while \"One Tree Hill\" was released as a fourth single in Australia and New Zealand. Initially slated as a single release, \"Red Hill Mining Town\" was the only track from the album not played on the tour. Bono has suggested that the song's high notes put too much strain on his voice.\n\nUpon its release, \"The Joshua Tree\" debuted at #1 in the UK and also quickly reached the top of the charts in the U.S. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine (following The Beatles, The Band, and The Who), who declared that U2 was \"Rock's Hottest Ticket\". The album brought U2 to a new level of mega-stardom, as the worldwide Joshua Tree Tour sold out arenas and stadiums around the world, the first time the band had consistently played venues of that size.\n\n\"The Joshua Tree\" won U2 their first two Grammy Awards, with the band receiving honors for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal\".\n\nAccording to U.S. Recording Industry sales figures, as of January 2005, \"The Joshua Tree\" ranks as the 89th best-selling album of all-time in the U.S. and, as of 2006, the 26th best-selling album in the U.K.. The album has sold 10 million copies in the United States alone and more than 25 million copies worldwide. It remains the band's best-selling album.\n\n\"The Joshua Tree\" is often cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In 1989, it was rated #3 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's\", as well as appearing at #26 on the magazine's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The Definitive 200 list sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ranks the album as the fifth-greatest in history. \"The Joshua Tree\" was selected as #6 on CCM Magazine's 2001 list of the greatest Contemporary Christian music albums of all time (see CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music). It came second place in Channel 4's 100 Greatest albums. It came in at #10 on ABC Television's My Favourite Album program, which aired in Australia in December 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Joshua+Tree\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
