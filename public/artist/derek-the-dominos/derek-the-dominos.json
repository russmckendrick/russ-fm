  "biography": "Derek and the Dominos were a blues rock band formed in the spring of 1970 by guitarist and singer Eric Clapton, keyboardist and singer Bobby Whitlock, bassist Carl Radle and drummer Jim Gordon. They had previously played together in Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. Dave Mason supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig.\n\nThe band released only one studio album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. The album went on to receive critical acclaim, but initially faltered in sales and in radio airplay. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album's single \"Layla\" (a tale of unrequited love inspired by Clapton's relationship with his friend George Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd) made the top ten in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album, which has received praise from critics and fans alike, is often considered to be the defining achievement of Clapton's career. Layla featured slide guitar from guest guitarist Duane Allman, who contributed lead, rhythm or slide guitar on most of the cuts on the album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Derek+&+The+Dominos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
