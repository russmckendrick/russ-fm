      "biography": "Rush were a Canadian rock band formed in 1968 in Toronto, that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their 1974 self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.\n\nRush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with Fly by Night (1975), 2112 (1976), A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984) and Counterparts (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.\n\nRush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.\n\nAs of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nRush (1974)\nFly by Night (1975)\nCaress of Steel (1975)\n2112 (1976)\nA Farewell to Kings (1977)\nHemispheres (1978)\nPermanent Waves (1980)\nMoving Pictures (1981)\nSignals (1982)\nGrace Under Pressure (1984)\nPower Windows (1985)\nHold Your Fire (1987)\nPresto (1989)\nRoll the Bones (1991)\nCounterparts (1993)\nTest for Echo (1996)\nVapor Trails (2002)\nSnakes & Arrows (2007)\nClockwork Angels (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album went Double Platinum according to Atlantic Records although the RIAA has it listed at Platinum.\n\n\n\nStyle\nRoll the Bones marks further change from the 80s Rush to the 90s Rush. The roles have generally been reversed; guitar is beginning to creep to the front of the song arrangements, while bursts of keyboard and organ are played in the background. \"Dreamline\" and \"Roll the Bones\" were popular radio staples of the early 90s, with the former reaching #1 on Mainstream Rock Tracks, while \"Where's My Thing?\" became the band’s third instrumental. The musical style of Roll the Bones paved the way for the \"alternative\" style of 1993’s Counterparts.\n\nTrack listing\nAll music by Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee and lyrics by Neil Peart.\n\n\"Dreamline\" – 4:38 \n\"Bravado\" – 4:35 \n\"Roll the Bones\" – 5:30 \n\"Face Up\" – 3:54 \n\"Where's My Thing?
