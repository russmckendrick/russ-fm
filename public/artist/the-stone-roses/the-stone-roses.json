  "biography": "The Stone Roses were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. They were one of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani, and drummer Reni.\n\nThe Stone Roses released their eponymous debut album in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band, receiving widespread critical acclaim, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded.\n\nFollowing this success, the band sought to capitalize on their newfound fame by signing with a major label. However, their record label at the time, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, leading to a lengthy legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991.\n\nThe Stone Roses released their second album, Second Coming, in 1994, which received mixed reviews. The group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at the Reading Festival.\n\nFollowing much media speculation, the Stone Roses announced their reunion on 18 October 2011 and embarked on a world tour in 2012, including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester. Plans to record a third album were also floated, but only two singles were released. In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of the film Spike Island, revealed that the band \"have at least three or four new tracks recorded\". In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation, directed by Shane Meadows and titled The Stone Roses: Made of Stone, was released.\n\nIn 2016, the Stone Roses released two new songs, which were their first new material in two decades. The band continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated that the band had split again. This was later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Roses\n\nStudio albums\nThe Stone Roses (1989)\nSecond Coming (1994) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
