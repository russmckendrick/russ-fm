      "biography": "Sade (pronounced “shah-day”) is a Grammy-winning British smooth jazz band named after their lead singer Sade Adu. The band’s music features elements of jazz, funk, soul and rnb.\n\nSade was formed in 1982, when members of a Latino-soul band Pride — Sade Adu, (real name Helen Folasade Adu - born 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Nigeria) Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman — together with Paul Cook formed a splinter group and began to write their own material. Sade made their debut in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott’s Club in London, England, in support of Pride. Later, in 1983, Andrew Hale joined Sade. In 1984 Paul Cook left the band.\n\nSade Adu, the band’s singer, is the daughter of a Nigerian father and an English mother. After her mother returned to England, Sade grew up on the North End of London. Developing a good singing voice in her teens, Sade worked part-time jobs in and outside of the music business. She listened to Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Holliday. Sade studied fashion design at St. Martin’s School of Art in London while also doing some modeling on the side.\n\nAround 1980, Adu started singing harmony with a latin funk group called Arriva. One of the more popular numbers that the group would perform was a Sade original co-written with bandmember Ray St. John, “Smooth Operator,” that would later become Sade’s first stateside hit. The following year Adu joined the eight-piece funk band Pride as a background singer. The band included future Sade band members guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman (a key player in ’90s urban soul singer Maxwell’s success) and bassist Paul Denman. The concept of the group was that there could shoot-offs. In essence, a few members within the main group Pride formed mini-groups that would be the opening act. Pride did a lot of shows around London, stirring up record company interest. Initially, the labels wanted to only sign Adu, while the group members wanted a deal for the whole band. After a year, the other band members told Adu, Matthewman, and Denman to go ahead and sign a deal. Adding keyboardist Andrew Hale, the group signed to the U.K. division of Epic Records.\n\nIn May 1983, Sade performed at Danceteria Club in New York, NY, United States. It was the first US Sade show. They received more attention from the media and record companies and separated finally. On 18 October 1983 Sade Adu signed with Epic Records. The rest of the band signed in 1984. All Sade albums were released through this label.\n\nTheir debut album, Diamond Life (with overall production by Robin Millar), went Top Ten in the U.K. in late 1984. January 1985 saw the album released on CBS’ Portrait label and by spring it went platinum off the strength of the Top Ten singles “Smooth Operator” and “Hang on to Your Love.” The second album, Promise (November 1985), featured “Never As Good As the First Time” and arguably her signature song, “The Sweetest Taboo,” which stayed on the U.S. pop charts for six months. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the ’70s practice of playing album tracks, adding “Is It a Crime” and “Tar Baby” to their play lists. In 1986, Sade won a Grammy for Best New Artist.\n\nSade’s third album was 1988’s Stronger Than Pride and featured their first number one soul single “Paradise,” “Nothing Can Come Between Us,” and “Keep Looking.” A new Sade album didn’t appear for four years. 1992’s Love Deluxe continued the unbroken streak of multi-platinum Sade albums, spinning off the hits “No Ordinary Love,” “Feel No Pain,” and “Pearls.” While the album’s producer Mike Pela, Matthewman, Denman, and Hale have gone on to other projects. The new millennium did spark a new scene for Sade. She issued Lovers Rock in fall 2000 and incoporated more mainstream elements than ever before. Debut single “By Your Side” was also a hit among radio and adult-contemporary listerners. The following summer, Sade embarked on their first tour in more than a decade, selling out countless dates across America. In early 2002, Sade celebrated their success of the tour by releasing their first ever live album and DVD, Lovers Live.\n\nSade made a great contribution to development of modern music. They dismantled many of the old music business ways and quite promptly became a fully functioning autonomous unit with a firm grip on every aspect of the recording process.\n\nSade is first and foremost a live act. Sade Adu said in one of her interviews: “When we play I know that the people love the music. I can feel it.” Throughout their history, Sade have always attracted a diverse, multi-racial audience who are drawn by the band’s open-minded approach to music. “And that’s the best thing we’ve achieved.”",

      "editorial_notes": "Released in 1984, Sade’s <i>Diamond Life</i> is one of the most fully realised debut albums of the last 40 years—an influential worldwide smash whose influence continues to ripple through popular music today. The album’s nine songs—eight originals, plus a brooding cover of R&B singer Timmy Thomas’ 1973 hit “Why Can’t We Live Together”—seemingly hover in the space they occupy, like light glimmering off of a city street late at night after fresh rain. Arriving smack dab in the middle of the 1980s, <i>Diamond Life</i>’s release came just as “quiet storm” R&B became a dominant force on Black radio stations in the US—and the music of this British quartet, led by Sade Adu, would come to define the genre for a multitude of listeners. But <i>Diamond Life</i> is by no means a record situated in time; the music sounds and feels eternal, far beyond the ways in which its DNA has been incorporated into modern-day neo-soul and R&B. \n\nRecorded over the course of six weeks in London’s legendary Power Plant Studios, <i>Diamond Life</i>—and Sade as an entity—was born out of Adu’s previous gig as a backup singer for the band Pride. She formed a songwriting partnership with Stuart Matthewman, the band’s guitarist and saxophonist; the duo would eventually team with Pride members Paul Denman (bass) and Paul Anthony Cooke (drums) to break off and form Sade. The group’s catalogue as a whole is often associated with romance and sensuality, but the songs on <i>Diamond Life</i> often bear the mark of hardship and uncertainty: The smouldering “Sally” is a tribute of sorts to the open charity of the Salvation Army, while the bold and cautiously optimistic “When Am I Going to Make a Living” was inspired by Adu not being able to pay a dry-cleaning ticket. But the cool-handed interplay Sade showcase on <i>Diamond Life</i> betrayed their status as a relatively new group, featuring a sound so natural, it feels as though the members had been playing for decades already. The word “timeless” has never felt so deeply earned.",
