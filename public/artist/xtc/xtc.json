  "biography": "XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.\n\nPartridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and avant-garde. The single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" (1980) and \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982). After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding and guitarist Dave Gregory. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking (1986), Oranges & Lemons (1989) and Nonsuch (1992). In the US, \"Mayor of Simpleton\" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while \"Dear God\" (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.\n\nDue to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of Apple Venus Volume 1 (1999), after which the XTC name briefly served as a banner for what were effectively solo efforts by Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC \"in the past tense\". Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC&I in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active.",

The band ceased performing live in 1982, prompting Terry to leave and, rather than replacing him, they then used various session drummers for their remaining studio albums.\r\nTheir live legacy continues through Terry's band [a12676994].",

The band ceased performing live in 1982, prompting Terry to leave and, rather than replacing him, they then used various session drummers for their remaining studio albums.\r\nTheir live legacy continues through Terry's band [a12676994].",

Active between the late 1970s and the mid 2000s, XTC\\'s music ranged from jerky new wave/punk riffs to lushly-arranged progressive pop. They also drew heavily from vintage pop rock and psychedelia from the 1960s, genres which they began to explore more deeply after creating The Dukes of Stratosphear side-project. While XTC failed to maintain significant commercial success after the 1980s, they have earned a devoted cult following, influencing many alternative  musicians.\\n\\nFirst coming together in 1972, the core duo of Partridge and Moulding went through numerous band names (including The Helium Kidz and Star Park) over the next five years. Drawing influence from the New York Dolls and the emerging New York punk scene, they played glam rock with homemade costumes and slowly built up a following. Drummer Terry Chambers joined in 1973. Keyboard player Barry Andrews followed in 1976, and the band finally settled on a name: XTC. By this time, the punk rock movement was in full swing, and XTC had found their style, a unique brand of hyperactive pop mixed with funk, punk, ska, reggae, and art rock.\\n\\nThe touring years, 1977–82\\n\\nIn 1977 XTC was signed by Virgin Records. They recorded the 3D EP that summer, and followed it up with their debut LP White Music in January 1978. White Music received favorable reviews and entered the British top 30, but lead single \"Statue of Liberty\" was banned by the BBC for making supposedly lewd references to the famous statue. An early TV appearance to play \"Science Friction\" on children\\'s show \"Magpie\" caused additional stir with the graffiti banner on Andrew\\'s Hammond organ saying \"Petra\\'s Dead\" - a reference to the much loved pet dog on rival show \"Blue Peter\"\\n\\nAfter their second effort, Go 2, and its accompanying Go+ EP (a collection of dub mixes of songs from the album), Andrews left and was replaced by guitarist and keyboardist Dave Gregory. Andrews went on to form Shriekback and also worked with Robert Fripp\\'s League of Gentlemen. With Gregory\\'s arrival, the band scored their first charting single, Moulding\\'s \"Life Begins at the Hop\".\\n\\nThe loss of Andrews\\' distinctive keyboard playing started the band on a path towards a more traditional rock sound, although Gregory also contributed occasional keyboards (and later, string arrangements). The resulting album, Drums and Wires, contained the band\\'s first big hit, \"Making Plans for Nigel\", which caused a minor controversy because of its lyrical reference to British Steel. The album found the band branching out into more overtly political topics, culminating in the unhinged ranting of Complicated Game, which became one of the band\\'s most well-known non-hits. Drums and Wires also marked their first sessions at London\\'s Townhouse Studios. The studio was at the time much sought after for its highly reverberant \"live\" drum room, and it was greatly favoured by their producer of the time, Steve Lillywhite and his engineer Hugh Padgham.\\n\\nDuring this period, Partridge also further indulged his love of dub, releasing a solo LP under the name \\'Mr Partridge\\'. The album, Take Away/The Lure of Salvage, featured radical dub deconstructions of music from the preceding XTC albums.\\n\\nTheir 1980 LP, Black Sea spawned the hit singles \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" and \"Generals and Majors.\" The song \"Sgt Rock\" namechecks a cartoon character of the same name and reflects Partridge\\'s lifelong obsession with American comics, particularly the work of Steve Ditko.\\n\\nThe last major hit of XTC\\'s touring phase was \"Senses Working Overtime,\" the first single from their double album English Settlement and a top 10 hit in 1982. At the peak of their popularity, the band embarked on a major tour, but Partridge suffered a breakdown on stage during one of the first concerts of the tour in Paris on March 18, 1982.\\n\\nThe studio years, 1982–1992\\n\\nAndy Partridge\\'s breakdown, which manifested itself as uncontrollable stage fright, was reportedly precipitated by his wife throwing away his supply of Valium. According to the band\\'s biography, Andy had become dependent upon the drug after it was prescribed to him as a teenager during his parents\\' divorce. He reportedly was never withdrawn from the drug and became dependent on it, although many fans were surprised that the group\\'s frenetic early output was produced by a man who was addicted to tranquilisers.\\n\\nConcerned about her husband\\'s dependence on the drug, Partridge\\'s wife ill-advisedly threw his tablets away—without seeking medical advice—just before the Paris concert. Not surprisingly, Partridge suffered anxiety attacks of such severity that he was soon forced to withdraw from touring permanently. The European and British dates were cancelled and after one show in San Diego the whole U.S. leg was also abandoned. Since then, XTC has been exclusively a studio band, although they have given occasional live-to-air performances from radio stations, and have made a handful of TV appearances as well.\\n\\nChambers left the band shortly thereafter, during the recording of their 1983 album Mummer. He was unhappy with the confines of the studio, and also felt the loss of income that resulted from their withdrawal from touring—he did not write, and so received no publishing royalties. Another major factor was his relationship with his Australian girlfriend—they subsequently married, and Chambers migrated to Australia and settled in Newcastle, New South Wales. Rather than finding a replacement, XTC has used a series of session drummers over the years, including Peter Phipps, Prairie Prince of The Tubes, Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention, Pat Mastelotto of Mr. Mister, Chuck Sabo, and Dave Gregory\\'s brother, Ian Gregory (as \"E.I.E.I. Owen\").\\n\\nIf Mummer saw Partridge cooling his heels with pastoral gems like \"Love on a Farmboy\\'s Wages\", the band\\'s next album took a noisy left turn. 1984\\'s The Big Express, surprised both their record company and fans alike with its abrasive sound and became XTC\\'s poorest seller to date. The album nonetheless was a personal high point for Partridge, who considers songs such as \"The Everyday Story of Smalltown\" and \"Train Running Low on Soul Coal\" amongst the best he\\'s ever written.\\n\\nIn 1986, the band traveled to Todd Rundgren\\'s studio-in-the-woods in Woodstock, New York to record what many consider to be the best album of their career, Skylarking. Although the pairing of XTC and Rundgren was highly anticipated by fans, the sessions were less than enjoyable for the band. Rundgren had insisted that the band send him, in advance, demos of all the songs that they thought they might tackle for the record. When the band got to Woodstock, Rundgren had already worked out a running order for both the recording and sequence of the album itself. True to his \"hands-on\" studio production style, Rundgren insisted that everyone adhere to his scheme. This did not sit well with the band, Partridge in particular. The two egos of Rundgren and Partridge clashed frequently during the recording of Skylarking and when it was finished Partridge said that he was not at all happy with the result. Partridge has since softened his view, describing the album as \"a summer\\'s day baked into one cake.\"\\n\\nSkylarking revived the band\\'s commercial fortunes, earning critical accolades and spawning the controversial hit \"Dear God\", which was originally issued as the B-side of the album\\'s first single, \"Grass.\" Interest in the song saw the album re-pressed with \"Dear God\" included and the new version of the LP sold 250,000 copies in the USA. (\"Dear God\" replaced \"Mermaid Smiled\", which was absent from the album until it was finally reinstated for the remastered \"Skylarking\" CD in 2000.)\\n\\nThe band\\'s follow up, Oranges and Lemons, produced by Paul Fox, was their biggest seller yet, with \"Mayor of Simpleton\" and \"King for a Day\" getting heavy airplay on MTV. It was during this period that Partridge began a relationship with an American fan, Erica Wexler, the niece of famed American record producer Jerry Wexler. Although signs of the failing of Partridge\\'s first marriage were evident as far back as English Settlement (notably on the album\\'s closing track, \"Snowman\"), it was some time before the still-married Partridge felt comfortable with Wexler\\'s advances; this awkward situation is chronicled in the song \"Another Satellite\". However, the relationship finally came to fruition after Partridge\\'s first wife Marianne left him, and Wexler and Partridge are now in a long term relationship.\\n\\nDuring their long career, XTC have also released material under a variety of pseudonyms, including two albums of psychedelic parodies as \"The Dukes of Stratosphear\" (ultimately released on a single CD, Chips from the Chocolate Fireball, simultaneous with the second album\\'s vinyl release), a Viz comics promotional single as \"Johnny Japes and his Jesticles,\" a Christmas-themed single as \"The Three Wise Men\" and a guest appearance on their own tribute album Testimonial Dinner as \"Terry and the Lovemen.\"\\n\\nTheir 1992 album, Nonsuch (named after Henry VIII\\'s fabled palace), united them with famed UK producer Gus Dudgeon and drummer Dave Mattacks. The album featured the US and UK hit tune, \"The Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead\", which brought the band perhaps its greatest success after the early eighties. (The video for \"Peter Pumpkinhead\" made an unusual comparison between Jesus and John F. Kennedy.) Despite its success, soon after its release, a contractual dispute with their label, Virgin Records, saw XTC go \"on strike\" from 1992 through 1998, finally resulting in the termination of their contract. They issued no new material during this time, although two compilations were released: Upsy Daisy Assortment and the 2-CD set Fossil Fuel: The XTC Singles Collection, which featured remastered versions of their singles, including many tracks not issued on CD before.\\n\\nManagement and contractual problems had dogged the band throughout their career, and around the time of the recording of Nonsuch they had to make a legal settlement with their former manager; although most fans assume (and the lyrics of \"I Bought Myself a Liarbird\" from The Big Express imply) that there was some financial impropriety involved, the terms of the settlement imposed a \"gag\" on the band and have prevented them from speaking publicly about the matter.\\n\\nThe final straw for the band was Virgin\\'s scuttling of their 1992 single \"Wrapped in Grey\", which was pressed up in the tens of thousands, and then recalled and destroyed by the label. The band asked that Virgin either allow them to re-negotiate their contract or release them, but the label stalled for years until finally agreeing to release them after a change of management at the company.\\n\\n\\nGoing independent, 1992–2006\\n\\nAfter leaving Virgin, Partridge had their accounts audited and it was discovered that the company had withheld substantial royalty payments from them. The settlement of the accounts provided the group with much-needed cash flow, allowing Partridge and Moulding to install fully-equipped studios and work comfortably at home. They are now able to record the majority of their work themselves, although they have used major commercial studios (including Abbey Road Studios in London) for some sessions. Finally released from Virgin, they formed their own label, Idea Records.\\n\\nDave Gregory quit the band during the recording of the 1999 album Apple Venus Volume 1 after 20 years\\' service. His contribution to the mature XTC sound had been immense: the technical skill of his guitar and keyboard playing, and his orchestral scoring, had facilitated a huge expansion in the group\\'s sonic possibilities. His skills also encouraged, perhaps goaded Partridge to new heights of musicianship.\\n\\nHowever, without him, Partridge and Moulding delivered Apple Venus Volume 1. Its successor, Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2), though favorably reviewed, was considered less strong. The two volumes were originally envisioned as the two discs of a double album, and in October 2005 they were reissued together in the 4 CD Apple Box collection.\\n\\nNow in control of their own work and with their own small studio, Partridge and Moulding have released instrumental and demo versions of their first two albums on Idea, Apple Venus and Wasp Star. Having left Virgin, relations have improved and Andy Partridge has since released a series of albums of demos of his songs (mainly from the Virgin years) under the title of Fuzzy Warbles in 2002, on a new label imprint APE, which could stand for Andy Partridge Experiments or Andy Partridge Editions or any one of a thousand connotations of the letter E. Colin Moulding declined to contribute his demos to the series. As of January 2006, the Fuzzy Warbles series has run to fully six volumes; volumes seven and eight are slated to appear by mid-2006.\\n\\nA boxed 4 CD compilation, Coat of Many Cupboards spanning the band\\'s time with Virgin, was also released in 2002.\\n\\nThough the immediate and medium-term future for XTC still remains uncertain, the inclusion of the first new tracks for five years, \"Spiral\", penned by Partridge, and \"Say It\", written by Moulding, on the Apple Box release offers some hope of the band\\'s continuance.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Partridge told several interviewers that Moulding no longer had any interest in writing, performing or even listening to music. Partridge has said he would not continue XTC without Moulding, and that therefore he has been forced to regard XTC \"in the past tense,\" with no likelihood of a new project unless Moulding should have a change of heart. \\n\\nAs of December 2018, five XTC albums (Nonsuch, Drums and Wires, Oranges and Lemons, Skylarking and Black Sea) have been given expanded reissues on APE featuring 5.1 Surround mixes and new stereo mixes by renowned remixer Steven Wilson, with a yet-unnamed sixth in the works as confirmed on Andy Partridge\\'s Twitter. Further vinyl and CD reissues have been released of English Settlement, Apple Venus Volume 1 and Wasp Star, with more planned for 2019 and 2020 according to sleeve notes on the Apple Venus/Wasp Star vinyl.\\n\\n2) XTC was a Drum & Bass producer and DJ from Nottingham, Britain. Adam aka XTC started mixing in 1989 and went on to DJ and produce on the UK Rave, Jungle, Ragga Jungle, and D\\'n\\'B scene\\'s from 1992 through to 1997 playing for the likes of Amnesia House, Total Kaos, Jungle Rock, Bushdoctor, Amazon Etc.

Active between the late 1970s and the mid 2000s, XTC\\'s music ranged from jerky new wave/punk riffs to lushly-arranged progressive pop. They also drew heavily from vintage pop rock and psychedelia from the 1960s, genres which they began to explore more deeply after creating The Dukes of Stratosphear side-project. While XTC failed to maintain significant commercial success after the 1980s, they have earned a devoted cult following, influencing many alternative  musicians.\\n\\nFirst coming together in 1972, the core duo of Partridge and Moulding went through numerous band names (including The Helium Kidz and Star Park) over the next five years. Drawing influence from the New York Dolls and the emerging New York punk scene, they played glam rock with homemade costumes and slowly built up a following. Drummer Terry Chambers joined in 1973. Keyboard player Barry Andrews followed in 1976, and the band finally settled on a name: XTC. By this time, the punk rock movement was in full swing, and XTC had found their style, a unique brand of hyperactive pop mixed with funk, punk, ska, reggae, and art rock.\\n\\nThe touring years, 1977–82\\n\\nIn 1977 XTC was signed by Virgin Records. They recorded the 3D EP that summer, and followed it up with their debut LP White Music in January 1978. White Music received favorable reviews and entered the British top 30, but lead single \"Statue of Liberty\" was banned by the BBC for making supposedly lewd references to the famous statue. An early TV appearance to play \"Science Friction\" on children\\'s show \"Magpie\" caused additional stir with the graffiti banner on Andrew\\'s Hammond organ saying \"Petra\\'s Dead\" - a reference to the much loved pet dog on rival show \"Blue Peter\"\\n\\nAfter their second effort, Go 2, and its accompanying Go+ EP (a collection of dub mixes of songs from the album), Andrews left and was replaced by guitarist and keyboardist Dave Gregory. Andrews went on to form Shriekback and also worked with Robert Fripp\\'s League of Gentlemen. With Gregory\\'s arrival, the band scored their first charting single, Moulding\\'s \"Life Begins at the Hop\".\\n\\nThe loss of Andrews\\' distinctive keyboard playing started the band on a path towards a more traditional rock sound, although Gregory also contributed occasional keyboards (and later, string arrangements). The resulting album, Drums and Wires, contained the band\\'s first big hit, \"Making Plans for Nigel\", which caused a minor controversy because of its lyrical reference to British Steel. The album found the band branching out into more overtly political topics, culminating in the unhinged ranting of Complicated Game, which became one of the band\\'s most well-known non-hits. Drums and Wires also marked their first sessions at London\\'s Townhouse Studios. The studio was at the time much sought after for its highly reverberant \"live\" drum room, and it was greatly favoured by their producer of the time, Steve Lillywhite and his engineer Hugh Padgham.\\n\\nDuring this period, Partridge also further indulged his love of dub, releasing a solo LP under the name \\'Mr Partridge\\'. The album, Take Away/The Lure of Salvage, featured radical dub deconstructions of music from the preceding XTC albums.\\n\\nTheir 1980 LP, Black Sea spawned the hit singles \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" and \"Generals and Majors.\" The song \"Sgt Rock\" namechecks a cartoon character of the same name and reflects Partridge\\'s lifelong obsession with American comics, particularly the work of Steve Ditko.\\n\\nThe last major hit of XTC\\'s touring phase was \"Senses Working Overtime,\" the first single from their double album English Settlement and a top 10 hit in 1982. At the peak of their popularity, the band embarked on a major tour, but Partridge suffered a breakdown on stage during one of the first concerts of the tour in Paris on March 18, 1982.\\n\\nThe studio years, 1982–1992\\n\\nAndy Partridge\\'s breakdown, which manifested itself as uncontrollable stage fright, was reportedly precipitated by his wife throwing away his supply of Valium. According to the band\\'s biography, Andy had become dependent upon the drug after it was prescribed to him as a teenager during his parents\\' divorce. He reportedly was never withdrawn from the drug and became dependent on it, although many fans were surprised that the group\\'s frenetic early output was produced by a man who was addicted to tranquilisers.\\n\\nConcerned about her husband\\'s dependence on the drug, Partridge\\'s wife ill-advisedly threw his tablets away—without seeking medical advice—just before the Paris concert. Not surprisingly, Partridge suffered anxiety attacks of such severity that he was soon forced to withdraw from touring permanently. The European and British dates were cancelled and after one show in San Diego the whole U.S. leg was also abandoned. Since then, XTC has been exclusively a studio band, although they have given occasional live-to-air performances from radio stations, and have made a handful of TV appearances as well.\\n\\nChambers left the band shortly thereafter, during the recording of their 1983 album Mummer. He was unhappy with the confines of the studio, and also felt the loss of income that resulted from their withdrawal from touring—he did not write, and so received no publishing royalties. Another major factor was his relationship with his Australian girlfriend—they subsequently married, and Chambers migrated to Australia and settled in Newcastle, New South Wales. Rather than finding a replacement, XTC has used a series of session drummers over the years, including Peter Phipps, Prairie Prince of The Tubes, Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention, Pat Mastelotto of Mr. Mister, Chuck Sabo, and Dave Gregory\\'s brother, Ian Gregory (as \"E.I.E.I. Owen\").\\n\\nIf Mummer saw Partridge cooling his heels with pastoral gems like \"Love on a Farmboy\\'s Wages\", the band\\'s next album took a noisy left turn. 1984\\'s The Big Express, surprised both their record company and fans alike with its abrasive sound and became XTC\\'s poorest seller to date. The album nonetheless was a personal high point for Partridge, who considers songs such as \"The Everyday Story of Smalltown\" and \"Train Running Low on Soul Coal\" amongst the best he\\'s ever written.\\n\\nIn 1986, the band traveled to Todd Rundgren\\'s studio-in-the-woods in Woodstock, New York to record what many consider to be the best album of their career, Skylarking. Although the pairing of XTC and Rundgren was highly anticipated by fans, the sessions were less than enjoyable for the band. Rundgren had insisted that the band send him, in advance, demos of all the songs that they thought they might tackle for the record. When the band got to Woodstock, Rundgren had already worked out a running order for both the recording and sequence of the album itself. True to his \"hands-on\" studio production style, Rundgren insisted that everyone adhere to his scheme. This did not sit well with the band, Partridge in particular. The two egos of Rundgren and Partridge clashed frequently during the recording of Skylarking and when it was finished Partridge said that he was not at all happy with the result. Partridge has since softened his view, describing the album as \"a summer\\'s day baked into one cake.\"\\n\\nSkylarking revived the band\\'s commercial fortunes, earning critical accolades and spawning the controversial hit \"Dear God\", which was originally issued as the B-side of the album\\'s first single, \"Grass.\" Interest in the song saw the album re-pressed with \"Dear God\" included and the new version of the LP sold 250,000 copies in the USA. (\"Dear God\" replaced \"Mermaid Smiled\", which was absent from the album until it was finally reinstated for the remastered \"Skylarking\" CD in 2000.)\\n\\nThe band\\'s follow up, Oranges and Lemons, produced by Paul Fox, was their biggest seller yet, with \"Mayor of Simpleton\" and \"King for a Day\" getting heavy airplay on MTV. It was during this period that Partridge began a relationship with an American fan, Erica Wexler, the niece of famed American record producer Jerry Wexler. Although signs of the failing of Partridge\\'s first marriage were evident as far back as English Settlement (notably on the album\\'s closing track, \"Snowman\"), it was some time before the still-married Partridge felt comfortable with Wexler\\'s advances; this awkward situation is chronicled in the song \"Another Satellite\". However, the relationship finally came to fruition after Partridge\\'s first wife Marianne left him, and Wexler and Partridge are now in a long term relationship.\\n\\nDuring their long career, XTC have also released material under a variety of pseudonyms, including two albums of psychedelic parodies as \"The Dukes of Stratosphear\" (ultimately released on a single CD, Chips from the Chocolate Fireball, simultaneous with the second album\\'s vinyl release), a Viz comics promotional single as \"Johnny Japes and his Jesticles,\" a Christmas-themed single as \"The Three Wise Men\" and a guest appearance on their own tribute album Testimonial Dinner as \"Terry and the Lovemen.\"\\n\\nTheir 1992 album, Nonsuch (named after Henry VIII\\'s fabled palace), united them with famed UK producer Gus Dudgeon and drummer Dave Mattacks. The album featured the US and UK hit tune, \"The Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead\", which brought the band perhaps its greatest success after the early eighties. (The video for \"Peter Pumpkinhead\" made an unusual comparison between Jesus and John F. Kennedy.) Despite its success, soon after its release, a contractual dispute with their label, Virgin Records, saw XTC go \"on strike\" from 1992 through 1998, finally resulting in the termination of their contract. They issued no new material during this time, although two compilations were released: Upsy Daisy Assortment and the 2-CD set Fossil Fuel: The XTC Singles Collection, which featured remastered versions of their singles, including many tracks not issued on CD before.\\n\\nManagement and contractual problems had dogged the band throughout their career, and around the time of the recording of Nonsuch they had to make a legal settlement with their former manager; although most fans assume (and the lyrics of \"I Bought Myself a Liarbird\" from The Big Express imply) that there was some financial impropriety involved, the terms of the settlement imposed a \"gag\" on the band and have prevented them from speaking publicly about the matter.\\n\\nThe final straw for the band was Virgin\\'s scuttling of their 1992 single \"Wrapped in Grey\", which was pressed up in the tens of thousands, and then recalled and destroyed by the label. The band asked that Virgin either allow them to re-negotiate their contract or release them, but the label stalled for years until finally agreeing to release them after a change of management at the company.\\n\\n\\nGoing independent, 1992–2006\\n\\nAfter leaving Virgin, Partridge had their accounts audited and it was discovered that the company had withheld substantial royalty payments from them. The settlement of the accounts provided the group with much-needed cash flow, allowing Partridge and Moulding to install fully-equipped studios and work comfortably at home. They are now able to record the majority of their work themselves, although they have used major commercial studios (including Abbey Road Studios in London) for some sessions. Finally released from Virgin, they formed their own label, Idea Records.\\n\\nDave Gregory quit the band during the recording of the 1999 album Apple Venus Volume 1 after 20 years\\' service. His contribution to the mature XTC sound had been immense: the technical skill of his guitar and keyboard playing, and his orchestral scoring, had facilitated a huge expansion in the group\\'s sonic possibilities. His skills also encouraged, perhaps goaded Partridge to new heights of musicianship.\\n\\nHowever, without him, Partridge and Moulding delivered Apple Venus Volume 1. Its successor, Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2), though favorably reviewed, was considered less strong. The two volumes were originally envisioned as the two discs of a double album, and in October 2005 they were reissued together in the 4 CD Apple Box collection.\\n\\nNow in control of their own work and with their own small studio, Partridge and Moulding have released instrumental and demo versions of their first two albums on Idea, Apple Venus and Wasp Star. Having left Virgin, relations have improved and Andy Partridge has since released a series of albums of demos of his songs (mainly from the Virgin years) under the title of Fuzzy Warbles in 2002, on a new label imprint APE, which could stand for Andy Partridge Experiments or Andy Partridge Editions or any one of a thousand connotations of the letter E. Colin Moulding declined to contribute his demos to the series. As of January 2006, the Fuzzy Warbles series has run to fully six volumes; volumes seven and eight are slated to appear by mid-2006.\\n\\nA boxed 4 CD compilation, Coat of Many Cupboards spanning the band\\'s time with Virgin, was also released in 2002.\\n\\nThough the immediate and medium-term future for XTC still remains uncertain, the inclusion of the first new tracks for five years, \"Spiral\", penned by Partridge, and \"Say It\", written by Moulding, on the Apple Box release offers some hope of the band\\'s continuance.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Partridge told several interviewers that Moulding no longer had any interest in writing, performing or even listening to music. Partridge has said he would not continue XTC without Moulding, and that therefore he has been forced to regard XTC \"in the past tense,\" with no likelihood of a new project unless Moulding should have a change of heart. \\n\\nAs of December 2018, five XTC albums (Nonsuch, Drums and Wires, Oranges and Lemons, Skylarking and Black Sea) have been given expanded reissues on APE featuring 5.1 Surround mixes and new stereo mixes by renowned remixer Steven Wilson, with a yet-unnamed sixth in the works as confirmed on Andy Partridge\\'s Twitter. Further vinyl and CD reissues have been released of English Settlement, Apple Venus Volume 1 and Wasp Star, with more planned for 2019 and 2020 according to sleeve notes on the Apple Venus/Wasp Star vinyl.\\n\\n2) XTC was a Drum & Bass producer and DJ from Nottingham, Britain. Adam aka XTC started mixing in 1989 and went on to DJ and produce on the UK Rave, Jungle, Ragga Jungle, and D\\'n\\'B scene\\'s from 1992 through to 1997 playing for the likes of Amnesia House, Total Kaos, Jungle Rock, Bushdoctor, Amazon Etc.

      "biography_en": "XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.\n\nPartridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and avant-garde. The single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" (1980) and \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982). After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding and guitarist Dave Gregory. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking (1986), Oranges & Lemons (1989) and Nonsuch (1992). In the US, \"Mayor of Simpleton\" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while \"Dear God\" (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.\n\nDue to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of Apple Venus Volume 1 (1999), after which the XTC name briefly served as a banner for what were effectively solo efforts by Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC \"in the past tense\". Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC&I in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active.",

      "biography_fr": "XTC est un groupe new wave formé à Swindon, en Angleterre, en 1976. Après plus de vingt ans de carrière et plus d’une douzaine d’albums, XTC reste surtout connu du grand public français pour son « tubesque » Making Plans For Nigel, bien qu’il soit considéré par les professionnels de la musique et la critique comme l’un des groupes majeurs de la pop anglaise post beatles. Leurs deux derniers albums Apple And Venus Vol.1 et Wasp Star – Apple And Venus Vol.2 ont d’ailleurs bénéficié d’un excellent accueil de la critique spécialisée lors de leurs sorties.\n\nFormé en 1974 à Swindon, XTC groupe majeur de la pop anglaise est signé par le label Virgin en 1977. Sa formation originale se compose d’Andy Partridge – guitariste chanteur, Colin Moulding – bassiste chanteur, Terry Chambers – batteur et Barry andrews – claviériste et saxophoniste. Comme The Police, XTC bénéficie pour émerger de l’explosion du mouvement Punk et de la frénésie des labels de l’époque dans la quête de nouvelles stars.\n\nLeurs deux premiers albums « White Music » et « Go 2 » proposent des compositions plutôt expérimentales. Ces deux disques produits par John Leckie seront très bien accueillis par la presse rock de l'époque et rencontreront malgré leur abord plutôt iconoclaste un réel succès public en Grande Bretagne avec des titres comme « This Is Pop » « Statue Of Liberty ». Toutefois, les tensions entre Andy Partridge, principal leader d’XTC, et Barry Andrews, claviériste, amènent ce dernier à quitter le groupe. Il participe à « The League Of Gentlemen », éphémère initiative de Robert Fripp leader de King Crimson, avant de créer sa formation Shriekback. Andy Partridge et Colin Moulding considèrent ces deux premiers albums comme anecdotiques.\n\nLa véritable naissance artistique d’XTC se matérialise lors l’enregistrement du troisième album « Drums and Wires » sorti en 1979. XTC recrute alors Dave Gregory guitariste multi-instrumentiste et arrangeur, originaire de Swindon et vieille connaissance d’Andy Partridge. Dès lors XTC se structure autour de deux compositeurs Andy Partridge et Colin Moulding, Dave Gregory – arrangeur et Terry Chambers à la batterie. Cet enregistrement confirme XTC comme l’un des plus grands espoirs de la pop anglaise de cette fin des années 1970 avec notamment leur premier tube international « Making Plans For Nigel ». Ce très gros succès, même s’il assure le devenir du groupe pose quelques problèmes d’ego à Andy Partridge, puisque cette composition est de Colin Moulding. À partir de l’album suivant la part des compositions de Colin Moulding se stabilisera entre le tiers et le quart de chaque album, le reste étant exclusivement dévolu à Andy Partridge.\n\nPuis suivent deux albums très différents, l’impressionnant et agressif « Black Sea » en 1980 et leur premier chef-d’œuvre « English Settlement » paru en 1981. Durant ces trois années XTC affirme une patte unique et novatrice qui leur permet de se libérer des contraintes stylistiques et d’en exploiter la diversité au service de leurs compositions. Il suffit de comparer « Drums and Wires » pop souvent dissonante et déstructurée à « Black Sea » caractérisé par un son brutal et puissant avec batterie en avant, guitares cinglantes et métalliques ou à « English Settlement » plus acoustique et empreint d’une finesse aux antipodes du précédent.\nBlack Sea déroule une série de compositions aux atmosphères agressives critiquant avec causticité la société anglaise de l’époque. Enregistré en quinze jours, il reflète l’énergie d’XTC, groupe de scène impressionnant. Des titres comme « Respectable Street » critique de la famille anglaise, « Paper and Iron » pamphlet contre le travail et la religion, « General And Majors » clairement anti-militariste, « Living Through Another Cuba » texte contre la logique des superpuissances est et ouest de l'époque font de « Black Sea » l’album le plus rock de leur discographie.\n\n« English settlement » double album vinyle de quinze titres contraste en tout point avec leur album précédent et ouvre de nouveaux horizons musicaux. Plus acoustique avec le tube « Senses Working Overtime » aux accents champêtres, les premières ballades d’Andy Partridge avec « Yacht Dance » et « All Of Sudden », les premières incursions musicales du côté de l’Afrique noire avec « Melt The Guns » et « It’s Nearly Africa » et bien sûr plusieurs joyaux pop comme « Leisure », « Knucle Down », « Down In A Cockpit » ou « Snowman » libère définitivement XTC de leur étiquette new wave. Pourtant au-delà de cette diversité stylistique s’affirme plus que jamais une signature. XTC apparaît désormais comme un groupe pop majeur même si le succès commercial n’est pas à la mesure des espérances de leur maison de disques Virgin.\n\nLors de la tournée française de « English Settlement » (1982) après un fabuleux concert au palais d’hiver (haut lieu du rock lyonnais avec en son sein le mythique West Side Club), alors qu’ils débutent le second concert au Palace, Andy Partridge est victime d’une crise de panique et hospitalisé. La tournée est annulée. Epuisé par des années de tournées internationales, XTC ne remontera plus jamais sur scène. Seules quelques sessions Live pour la BBC seront réalisées en public à la suite de leur double album « Oranges And Lemons » paru en 1989.\nAlors qu’ils sont considérés comme l’un des plus importants groupes de rock anglais de ce début des années 80 aux côtés de The Police, Joe Jackson, The Clash ou Elvis Costello and The Attractions, l’arrêt des concerts, déstabilise la formation et Terry Chambers démissionne lors des séances d’enregistrement de « Mummer » l’album suivant.\n\nSon nouveau départ, on le doit à John Leckie, producteur de la première heure qui leur propose de réaliser un mini-album pastiche en hommage à la période psychédélique des 60,s. Il se rebaptise « The Duke Of The Stratosphear ». Un premier mini-album « 25 O’clock » sort en 1985. Tout le monde croit découvrir un nouveau groupe, les musiciens ont pris des pseudonymes. C’est une réussite saluée par la critique. Le succès est immédiat, les ventes dépassent celles de « The Big Express », alors que l’album a coûté vingt fois moins cher. La carrière d’XTC est relancée, Virgin propose de financer un nouvel album.\nCe sera « Skylarking », produit et arrangé par Todd Rundgren au Studio Utopia à New York en 1986. De l’aveu des musiciens d’XTC, ce fut l’enregistrement le plus éprouvant de leur carrière tant les relations entre Todd Rundgren et Andy Partridge furent orageuses. Colin Moulding faillit aussi claquer la porte. Pourtant, de ces séances d’enregistrements naquit certainement l’album le plus abouti depuis « English Settlement » : « Skylarking », concept album construit autour du cycle du jour. L’apport de Todd Rundgren est alors déterminant. Les arrangements de cordes, de cuivres enrichissent la musique d’XTC d’une dimension orchestrale aux influences jazzy sur « The Man Who Sailed Around His Soul » ou plus classique comme sur « 1000 Umbrellas ». Cet album leur apporte à nouveau la reconnaissance du public ; aux États-Unis cette fois. Le réseau des radios universitaires adopte « Dear God », chanson sous forme de lettre d’adieu écrite par Andy Partridge et pourtant édité en face B du single « Grass ».\n\nEn 1987, il propose le second et dernier opus de « The Duke Of The Stratosphear » avec l’album « Psonic Psunspot ». Puis XTC reprend la plume pour préparer ce qui sera le double album de la confirmation et d’un équilibre retrouvé « Oranges and Lemons » édité en 1989. Ce disque rencontrera à nouveau le succes aux États Unis puisque le single « Mayor Of Simpleton » rentrera dans le top 100 US. D’autres pepites pop feront parler d’elles comme « The Loving », « King For A day » ou la merveilleuse ballades « Chalkhills and Children » . Certaines compositions nous entraînent vers un univers pop aux accents plus folks et roots. Des titres comme « Hold Me My Daddy » évolue du rock classique vers des accents de musique sud africaine, « Poor skeleton steps out », « Scarecrow people » font partie des compositions les plus acoustiques de l’univers d’XTC, héritage de la période « English Settlement » et « Mummer ». Malgré le succès de « Oranges And Lemons » il faudra attendre 1992 pour découvrir l'immense « Nonsuch » chef d'oeuvre pop de dix sept titres dont deux compositions connaîtront un certains succès public « The ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead » et l'excellent « The Disapointed ». Un album tout en finesse ou les chansons ciselées confirme l’originalité d’une écriture développée en dehors des contraintes du show business. La relation tendue entretenue depuis plusieurs années avec leur Label Virgin sur fonds de différents contractuels amènera ensuite XTC à garder un silence volontaire pendant sept longues années.\n\nXTC revient sur le devant de l’actualité musicale en 1999 avec le très bel album « Apple Venus Vol.1 » . Après le départ de Dave Gregory, XTC se réduit maintenant à un duo de compositeurs – Andy Partridge et Colin Moulding, dédié à l'enregistrement méticuleux de studio, démarche de travail similaire (style mis à part) au duo \"Steely Dan\" de la fin des années 70 composé de Donald Fagen et Walter Becker. Cet album plutôt orchestral s’ouvre sur le fabuleux « River Of Orchids » ou les violons en pizzicato constitue un thème rythmique et contemporain sur lequel se superpose d’extraordinaires arrangements vocaux. Il s’ensuit de merveilleux morceaux. L’oriental « Green Man », « Easter Theater », « I Can’t Own Her », « Harvet Festival » ou le lyrique « The Last Balloon » dont les orchestrations poursuivent audacieusement l’exploration des arcanes d’une pop moderne et sans complexe.\nLeur dernier album «Wasp Star – Apple Venus Vol.2 » paru en 2000, dévoile la facette plus rock de ce duo d’artisans quarantenaires à l'époque. L’album s’ouvre sur deux titres avec riffs de guitares saturés à souhaits, « Playground » et le jubilatoire et entêtant « Stupidly Happy ». « Church Of Women », « Wounded Horse » et tous les autres titres composants cet album constituent une leçon de pop pour tous les groupes néo-pop comme Blur et Oasis pour ne citer que les plus populaires des années 90’s.\nMais Hélas, depuis la sortie de l'album \"Wasp Star\" en 2000, silence radio...\n\nAprès une nuit arrosée, un projet de \"groupe secret\" est évoqué par XTC. Ils enregistrent quelques chansons et oublient vite le projet. C'est un peu plus tard qu'il leur revient en tête et ils ont idée de faire une farce en enregistrant et en sortant un album, 25 O'Clock, sous le pseudonyme The Dukes of Stratosphear où ils laisseraient leurs influences et leur inspiration des groupes pop rock des années 60 (The Kinks, The Beach Boys, The Beatles...) prendre le dessus. Ils poussent même le jeu jusqu'à sortir cet album le premier avril ! Ils sont vite démasqués, mais certains critiques ont réellement cru à un groupe \"dinosaure\" tout droit sorti des 60's! L'album sera un \"succès\", vendu à 30 000 exemplaires et salué par la critique (deux fois mieux vendu que le dernier album d'XTC!). Un bon coup de pub pour le groupe qui ressortira un album sous le nom The Dukes of Stratosphear et dont on leur proposa même de faire un film basé sur l'idée de 25 O'Clock!",

The band ceased performing live in 1982, prompting Terry to leave and, rather than replacing him, they then used various session drummers for their remaining studio albums.\r\nTheir live legacy continues through Terry's band [a12676994].",

      "bio_content": "There are multiple artists with this name:\n\n1) XTC were an alternative rock band from Swindon, England led by Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and  Colin Moulding (bass, vocals). Active between the late 1970s and the mid 2000s, XTC's music ranged from jerky new wave/punk riffs to lushly-arranged progressive pop. They also drew heavily from vintage pop rock and psychedelia from the 1960s, genres which they began to explore more deeply after creating The Dukes of Stratosphear side-project. While XTC failed to maintain significant commercial success after the 1980s, they have earned a devoted cult following, influencing many alternative  musicians.\n\nFirst coming together in 1972, the core duo of Partridge and Moulding went through numerous band names (including The Helium Kidz and Star Park) over the next five years. Drawing influence from the New York Dolls and the emerging New York punk scene, they played glam rock with homemade costumes and slowly built up a following. Drummer Terry Chambers joined in 1973. Keyboard player Barry Andrews followed in 1976, and the band finally settled on a name: XTC. By this time, the punk rock movement was in full swing, and XTC had found their style, a unique brand of hyperactive pop mixed with funk, punk, ska, reggae, and art rock.\n\nThe touring years, 1977–82\n\nIn 1977 XTC was signed by Virgin Records. They recorded the 3D EP that summer, and followed it up with their debut LP White Music in January 1978. White Music received favorable reviews and entered the British top 30, but lead single \"Statue of Liberty\" was banned by the BBC for making supposedly lewd references to the famous statue. An early TV appearance to play \"Science Friction\" on children's show \"Magpie\" caused additional stir with the graffiti banner on Andrew's Hammond organ saying \"Petra's Dead\" - a reference to the much loved pet dog on rival show \"Blue Peter\"\n\nAfter their second effort, Go 2, and its accompanying Go+ EP (a collection of dub mixes of songs from the album), Andrews left and was replaced by guitarist and keyboardist Dave Gregory. Andrews went on to form Shriekback and also worked with Robert Fripp's League of Gentlemen. With Gregory's arrival, the band scored their first charting single, Moulding's \"Life Begins at the Hop\".\n\nThe loss of Andrews' distinctive keyboard playing started the band on a path towards a more traditional rock sound, although Gregory also contributed occasional keyboards (and later, string arrangements). The resulting album, Drums and Wires, contained the band's first big hit, \"Making Plans for Nigel\", which caused a minor controversy because of its lyrical reference to British Steel. The album found the band branching out into more overtly political topics, culminating in the unhinged ranting of Complicated Game, which became one of the band's most well-known non-hits. Drums and Wires also marked their first sessions at London's Townhouse Studios. The studio was at the time much sought after for its highly reverberant \"live\" drum room, and it was greatly favoured by their producer of the time, Steve Lillywhite and his engineer Hugh Padgham.\n\nDuring this period, Partridge also further indulged his love of dub, releasing a solo LP under the name 'Mr Partridge'. The album, Take Away/The Lure of Salvage, featured radical dub deconstructions of music from the preceding XTC albums.\n\nTheir 1980 LP, Black Sea spawned the hit singles \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" and \"Generals and Majors.\" The song \"Sgt Rock\" namechecks a cartoon character of the same name and reflects Partridge's lifelong obsession with American comics, particularly the work of Steve Ditko.\n\nThe last major hit of XTC's touring phase was \"Senses Working Overtime,\" the first single from their double album English Settlement and a top 10 hit in 1982. At the peak of their popularity, the band embarked on a major tour, but Partridge suffered a breakdown on stage during one of the first concerts of the tour in Paris on March 18, 1982.\n\nThe studio years, 1982–1992\n\nAndy Partridge's breakdown, which manifested itself as uncontrollable stage fright, was reportedly precipitated by his wife throwing away his supply of Valium. According to the band's biography, Andy had become dependent upon the drug after it was prescribed to him as a teenager during his parents' divorce. He reportedly was never withdrawn from the drug and became dependent on it, although many fans were surprised that the group's frenetic early output was produced by a man who was addicted to tranquilisers.\n\nConcerned about her husband's dependence on the drug, Partridge's wife ill-advisedly threw his tablets away—without seeking medical advice—just before the Paris concert. Not surprisingly, Partridge suffered anxiety attacks of such severity that he was soon forced to withdraw from touring permanently. The European and British dates were cancelled and after one show in San Diego the whole U.S. leg was also abandoned. Since then, XTC has been exclusively a studio band, although they have given occasional live-to-air performances from radio stations, and have made a handful of TV appearances as well.\n\nChambers left the band shortly thereafter, during the recording of their 1983 album Mummer. He was unhappy with the confines of the studio, and also felt the loss of income that resulted from their withdrawal from touring—he did not write, and so received no publishing royalties. Another major factor was his relationship with his Australian girlfriend—they subsequently married, and Chambers migrated to Australia and settled in Newcastle, New South Wales. Rather than finding a replacement, XTC has used a series of session drummers over the years, including Peter Phipps, Prairie Prince of The Tubes, Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention, Pat Mastelotto of Mr. Mister, Chuck Sabo, and Dave Gregory's brother, Ian Gregory (as \"E.I.E.I. Owen\").\n\nIf Mummer saw Partridge cooling his heels with pastoral gems like \"Love on a Farmboy's Wages\", the band's next album took a noisy left turn. 1984's The Big Express, surprised both their record company and fans alike with its abrasive sound and became XTC's poorest seller to date. The album nonetheless was a personal high point for Partridge, who considers songs such as \"The Everyday Story of Smalltown\" and \"Train Running Low on Soul Coal\" amongst the best he's ever written.\n\nIn 1986, the band traveled to Todd Rundgren's studio-in-the-woods in Woodstock, New York to record what many consider to be the best album of their career, Skylarking. Although the pairing of XTC and Rundgren was highly anticipated by fans, the sessions were less than enjoyable for the band. Rundgren had insisted that the band send him, in advance, demos of all the songs that they thought they might tackle for the record. When the band got to Woodstock, Rundgren had already worked out a running order for both the recording and sequence of the album itself. True to his \"hands-on\" studio production style, Rundgren insisted that everyone adhere to his scheme. This did not sit well with the band, Partridge in particular. The two egos of Rundgren and Partridge clashed frequently during the recording of Skylarking and when it was finished Partridge said that he was not at all happy with the result. Partridge has since softened his view, describing the album as \"a summer's day baked into one cake.\"\n\nSkylarking revived the band's commercial fortunes, earning critical accolades and spawning the controversial hit \"Dear God\", which was originally issued as the B-side of the album's first single, \"Grass.\" Interest in the song saw the album re-pressed with \"Dear God\" included and the new version of the LP sold 250,000 copies in the USA. (\"Dear God\" replaced \"Mermaid Smiled\", which was absent from the album until it was finally reinstated for the remastered \"Skylarking\" CD in 2000.)\n\nThe band's follow up, Oranges and Lemons, produced by Paul Fox, was their biggest seller yet, with \"Mayor of Simpleton\" and \"King for a Day\" getting heavy airplay on MTV. It was during this period that Partridge began a relationship with an American fan, Erica Wexler, the niece of famed American record producer Jerry Wexler. Although signs of the failing of Partridge's first marriage were evident as far back as English Settlement (notably on the album's closing track, \"Snowman\"), it was some time before the still-married Partridge felt comfortable with Wexler's advances; this awkward situation is chronicled in the song \"Another Satellite\". However, the relationship finally came to fruition after Partridge's first wife Marianne left him, and Wexler and Partridge are now in a long term relationship.\n\nDuring their long career, XTC have also released material under a variety of pseudonyms, including two albums of psychedelic parodies as \"The Dukes of Stratosphear\" (ultimately released on a single CD, Chips from the Chocolate Fireball, simultaneous with the second album's vinyl release), a Viz comics promotional single as \"Johnny Japes and his Jesticles,\" a Christmas-themed single as \"The Three Wise Men\" and a guest appearance on their own tribute album Testimonial Dinner as \"Terry and the Lovemen.\"\n\nTheir 1992 album, Nonsuch (named after Henry VIII's fabled palace), united them with famed UK producer Gus Dudgeon and drummer Dave Mattacks. The album featured the US and UK hit tune, \"The Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead\", which brought the band perhaps its greatest success after the early eighties. (The video for \"Peter Pumpkinhead\" made an unusual comparison between Jesus and John F. Kennedy.) Despite its success, soon after its release, a contractual dispute with their label, Virgin Records, saw XTC go \"on strike\" from 1992 through 1998, finally resulting in the termination of their contract. They issued no new material during this time, although two compilations were released: Upsy Daisy Assortment and the 2-CD set Fossil Fuel: The XTC Singles Collection, which featured remastered versions of their singles, including many tracks not issued on CD before.\n\nManagement and contractual problems had dogged the band throughout their career, and around the time of the recording of Nonsuch they had to make a legal settlement with their former manager; although most fans assume (and the lyrics of \"I Bought Myself a Liarbird\" from The Big Express imply) that there was some financial impropriety involved, the terms of the settlement imposed a \"gag\" on the band and have prevented them from speaking publicly about the matter.\n\nThe final straw for the band was Virgin's scuttling of their 1992 single \"Wrapped in Grey\", which was pressed up in the tens of thousands, and then recalled and destroyed by the label. The band asked that Virgin either allow them to re-negotiate their contract or release them, but the label stalled for years until finally agreeing to release them after a change of management at the company.\n\n\nGoing independent, 1992–2006\n\nAfter leaving Virgin, Partridge had their accounts audited and it was discovered that the company had withheld substantial royalty payments from them. The settlement of the accounts provided the group with much-needed cash flow, allowing Partridge and Moulding to install fully-equipped studios and work comfortably at home. They are now able to record the majority of their work themselves, although they have used major commercial studios (including Abbey Road Studios in London) for some sessions. Finally released from Virgin, they formed their own label, Idea Records.\n\nDave Gregory quit the band during the recording of the 1999 album Apple Venus Volume 1 after 20 years' service. His contribution to the mature XTC sound had been immense: the technical skill of his guitar and keyboard playing, and his orchestral scoring, had facilitated a huge expansion in the group's sonic possibilities. His skills also encouraged, perhaps goaded Partridge to new heights of musicianship.\n\nHowever, without him, Partridge and Moulding delivered Apple Venus Volume 1. Its successor, Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2), though favorably reviewed, was considered less strong. The two volumes were originally envisioned as the two discs of a double album, and in October 2005 they were reissued together in the 4 CD Apple Box collection.\n\nNow in control of their own work and with their own small studio, Partridge and Moulding have released instrumental and demo versions of their first two albums on Idea, Apple Venus and Wasp Star. Having left Virgin, relations have improved and Andy Partridge has since released a series of albums of demos of his songs (mainly from the Virgin years) under the title of Fuzzy Warbles in 2002, on a new label imprint APE, which could stand for Andy Partridge Experiments or Andy Partridge Editions or any one of a thousand connotations of the letter E. Colin Moulding declined to contribute his demos to the series. As of January 2006, the Fuzzy Warbles series has run to fully six volumes; volumes seven and eight are slated to appear by mid-2006.\n\nA boxed 4 CD compilation, Coat of Many Cupboards spanning the band's time with Virgin, was also released in 2002.\n\nThough the immediate and medium-term future for XTC still remains uncertain, the inclusion of the first new tracks for five years, \"Spiral\", penned by Partridge, and \"Say It\", written by Moulding, on the Apple Box release offers some hope of the band's continuance.\n\nIn November 2006, Partridge told several interviewers that Moulding no longer had any interest in writing, performing or even listening to music. Partridge has said he would not continue XTC without Moulding, and that therefore he has been forced to regard XTC \"in the past tense,\" with no likelihood of a new project unless Moulding should have a change of heart. \n\nAs of December 2018, five XTC albums (Nonsuch, Drums and Wires, Oranges and Lemons, Skylarking and Black Sea) have been given expanded reissues on APE featuring 5.1 Surround mixes and new stereo mixes by renowned remixer Steven Wilson, with a yet-unnamed sixth in the works as confirmed on Andy Partridge's Twitter. Further vinyl and CD reissues have been released of English Settlement, Apple Venus Volume 1 and Wasp Star, with more planned for 2019 and 2020 according to sleeve notes on the Apple Venus/Wasp Star vinyl.\n\n2) XTC was a Drum & Bass producer and DJ from Nottingham, Britain. Adam aka XTC started mixing in 1989 and went on to DJ and produce on the UK Rave, Jungle, Ragga Jungle, and D'n'B scene's from 1992 through to 1997 playing for the likes of Amnesia House, Total Kaos, Jungle Rock, Bushdoctor, Amazon Etc. He was lucky enough to produce/remix and co-produce tracks for the likes of Barrington Levy and Chakka Demus & Pliers for Greensleeves records and various other labels.

      "biography_en": "XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.\n\nPartridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and avant-garde. The single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" (1980) and \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982). After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding and guitarist Dave Gregory. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking (1986), Oranges & Lemons (1989) and Nonsuch (1992). In the US, \"Mayor of Simpleton\" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while \"Dear God\" (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.\n\nDue to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of Apple Venus Volume 1 (1999), after which the XTC name briefly served as a banner for what were effectively solo efforts by Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC \"in the past tense\". Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC&I in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active.",

      "biography_fr": "XTC est un groupe new wave formé à Swindon, en Angleterre, en 1976. Après plus de vingt ans de carrière et plus d’une douzaine d’albums, XTC reste surtout connu du grand public français pour son « tubesque » Making Plans For Nigel, bien qu’il soit considéré par les professionnels de la musique et la critique comme l’un des groupes majeurs de la pop anglaise post beatles. Leurs deux derniers albums Apple And Venus Vol.1 et Wasp Star – Apple And Venus Vol.2 ont d’ailleurs bénéficié d’un excellent accueil de la critique spécialisée lors de leurs sorties.\n\nFormé en 1974 à Swindon, XTC groupe majeur de la pop anglaise est signé par le label Virgin en 1977. Sa formation originale se compose d’Andy Partridge – guitariste chanteur, Colin Moulding – bassiste chanteur, Terry Chambers – batteur et Barry andrews – claviériste et saxophoniste. Comme The Police, XTC bénéficie pour émerger de l’explosion du mouvement Punk et de la frénésie des labels de l’époque dans la quête de nouvelles stars.\n\nLeurs deux premiers albums « White Music » et « Go 2 » proposent des compositions plutôt expérimentales. Ces deux disques produits par John Leckie seront très bien accueillis par la presse rock de l'époque et rencontreront malgré leur abord plutôt iconoclaste un réel succès public en Grande Bretagne avec des titres comme « This Is Pop » « Statue Of Liberty ». Toutefois, les tensions entre Andy Partridge, principal leader d’XTC, et Barry Andrews, claviériste, amènent ce dernier à quitter le groupe. Il participe à « The League Of Gentlemen », éphémère initiative de Robert Fripp leader de King Crimson, avant de créer sa formation Shriekback. Andy Partridge et Colin Moulding considèrent ces deux premiers albums comme anecdotiques.\n\nLa véritable naissance artistique d’XTC se matérialise lors l’enregistrement du troisième album « Drums and Wires » sorti en 1979. XTC recrute alors Dave Gregory guitariste multi-instrumentiste et arrangeur, originaire de Swindon et vieille connaissance d’Andy Partridge. Dès lors XTC se structure autour de deux compositeurs Andy Partridge et Colin Moulding, Dave Gregory – arrangeur et Terry Chambers à la batterie. Cet enregistrement confirme XTC comme l’un des plus grands espoirs de la pop anglaise de cette fin des années 1970 avec notamment leur premier tube international « Making Plans For Nigel ». Ce très gros succès, même s’il assure le devenir du groupe pose quelques problèmes d’ego à Andy Partridge, puisque cette composition est de Colin Moulding. À partir de l’album suivant la part des compositions de Colin Moulding se stabilisera entre le tiers et le quart de chaque album, le reste étant exclusivement dévolu à Andy Partridge.\n\nPuis suivent deux albums très différents, l’impressionnant et agressif « Black Sea » en 1980 et leur premier chef-d’œuvre « English Settlement » paru en 1981. Durant ces trois années XTC affirme une patte unique et novatrice qui leur permet de se libérer des contraintes stylistiques et d’en exploiter la diversité au service de leurs compositions. Il suffit de comparer « Drums and Wires » pop souvent dissonante et déstructurée à « Black Sea » caractérisé par un son brutal et puissant avec batterie en avant, guitares cinglantes et métalliques ou à « English Settlement » plus acoustique et empreint d’une finesse aux antipodes du précédent.\nBlack Sea déroule une série de compositions aux atmosphères agressives critiquant avec causticité la société anglaise de l’époque. Enregistré en quinze jours, il reflète l’énergie d’XTC, groupe de scène impressionnant. Des titres comme « Respectable Street » critique de la famille anglaise, « Paper and Iron » pamphlet contre le travail et la religion, « General And Majors » clairement anti-militariste, « Living Through Another Cuba » texte contre la logique des superpuissances est et ouest de l'époque font de « Black Sea » l’album le plus rock de leur discographie.\n\n« English settlement » double album vinyle de quinze titres contraste en tout point avec leur album précédent et ouvre de nouveaux horizons musicaux. Plus acoustique avec le tube « Senses Working Overtime » aux accents champêtres, les premières ballades d’Andy Partridge avec « Yacht Dance » et « All Of Sudden », les premières incursions musicales du côté de l’Afrique noire avec « Melt The Guns » et « It’s Nearly Africa » et bien sûr plusieurs joyaux pop comme « Leisure », « Knucle Down », « Down In A Cockpit » ou « Snowman » libère définitivement XTC de leur étiquette new wave. Pourtant au-delà de cette diversité stylistique s’affirme plus que jamais une signature. XTC apparaît désormais comme un groupe pop majeur même si le succès commercial n’est pas à la mesure des espérances de leur maison de disques Virgin.\n\nLors de la tournée française de « English Settlement » (1982) après un fabuleux concert au palais d’hiver (haut lieu du rock lyonnais avec en son sein le mythique West Side Club), alors qu’ils débutent le second concert au Palace, Andy Partridge est victime d’une crise de panique et hospitalisé. La tournée est annulée. Epuisé par des années de tournées internationales, XTC ne remontera plus jamais sur scène. Seules quelques sessions Live pour la BBC seront réalisées en public à la suite de leur double album « Oranges And Lemons » paru en 1989.\nAlors qu’ils sont considérés comme l’un des plus importants groupes de rock anglais de ce début des années 80 aux côtés de The Police, Joe Jackson, The Clash ou Elvis Costello and The Attractions, l’arrêt des concerts, déstabilise la formation et Terry Chambers démissionne lors des séances d’enregistrement de « Mummer » l’album suivant.\n\nSon nouveau départ, on le doit à John Leckie, producteur de la première heure qui leur propose de réaliser un mini-album pastiche en hommage à la période psychédélique des 60,s. Il se rebaptise « The Duke Of The Stratosphear ». Un premier mini-album « 25 O’clock » sort en 1985. Tout le monde croit découvrir un nouveau groupe, les musiciens ont pris des pseudonymes. C’est une réussite saluée par la critique. Le succès est immédiat, les ventes dépassent celles de « The Big Express », alors que l’album a coûté vingt fois moins cher. La carrière d’XTC est relancée, Virgin propose de financer un nouvel album.\nCe sera « Skylarking », produit et arrangé par Todd Rundgren au Studio Utopia à New York en 1986. De l’aveu des musiciens d’XTC, ce fut l’enregistrement le plus éprouvant de leur carrière tant les relations entre Todd Rundgren et Andy Partridge furent orageuses. Colin Moulding faillit aussi claquer la porte. Pourtant, de ces séances d’enregistrements naquit certainement l’album le plus abouti depuis « English Settlement » : « Skylarking », concept album construit autour du cycle du jour. L’apport de Todd Rundgren est alors déterminant. Les arrangements de cordes, de cuivres enrichissent la musique d’XTC d’une dimension orchestrale aux influences jazzy sur « The Man Who Sailed Around His Soul » ou plus classique comme sur « 1000 Umbrellas ». Cet album leur apporte à nouveau la reconnaissance du public ; aux États-Unis cette fois. Le réseau des radios universitaires adopte « Dear God », chanson sous forme de lettre d’adieu écrite par Andy Partridge et pourtant édité en face B du single « Grass ».\n\nEn 1987, il propose le second et dernier opus de « The Duke Of The Stratosphear » avec l’album « Psonic Psunspot ». Puis XTC reprend la plume pour préparer ce qui sera le double album de la confirmation et d’un équilibre retrouvé « Oranges and Lemons » édité en 1989. Ce disque rencontrera à nouveau le succes aux États Unis puisque le single « Mayor Of Simpleton » rentrera dans le top 100 US. D’autres pepites pop feront parler d’elles comme « The Loving », « King For A day » ou la merveilleuse ballades « Chalkhills and Children » . Certaines compositions nous entraînent vers un univers pop aux accents plus folks et roots. Des titres comme « Hold Me My Daddy » évolue du rock classique vers des accents de musique sud africaine, « Poor skeleton steps out », « Scarecrow people » font partie des compositions les plus acoustiques de l’univers d’XTC, héritage de la période « English Settlement » et « Mummer ». Malgré le succès de « Oranges And Lemons » il faudra attendre 1992 pour découvrir l'immense « Nonsuch » chef d'oeuvre pop de dix sept titres dont deux compositions connaîtront un certains succès public « The ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead » et l'excellent « The Disapointed ». Un album tout en finesse ou les chansons ciselées confirme l’originalité d’une écriture développée en dehors des contraintes du show business. La relation tendue entretenue depuis plusieurs années avec leur Label Virgin sur fonds de différents contractuels amènera ensuite XTC à garder un silence volontaire pendant sept longues années.\n\nXTC revient sur le devant de l’actualité musicale en 1999 avec le très bel album « Apple Venus Vol.1 » . Après le départ de Dave Gregory, XTC se réduit maintenant à un duo de compositeurs – Andy Partridge et Colin Moulding, dédié à l'enregistrement méticuleux de studio, démarche de travail similaire (style mis à part) au duo \"Steely Dan\" de la fin des années 70 composé de Donald Fagen et Walter Becker. Cet album plutôt orchestral s’ouvre sur le fabuleux « River Of Orchids » ou les violons en pizzicato constitue un thème rythmique et contemporain sur lequel se superpose d’extraordinaires arrangements vocaux. Il s’ensuit de merveilleux morceaux. L’oriental « Green Man », « Easter Theater », « I Can’t Own Her », « Harvet Festival » ou le lyrique « The Last Balloon » dont les orchestrations poursuivent audacieusement l’exploration des arcanes d’une pop moderne et sans complexe.\nLeur dernier album «Wasp Star – Apple Venus Vol.2 » paru en 2000, dévoile la facette plus rock de ce duo d’artisans quarantenaires à l'époque. L’album s’ouvre sur deux titres avec riffs de guitares saturés à souhaits, « Playground » et le jubilatoire et entêtant « Stupidly Happy ». « Church Of Women », « Wounded Horse » et tous les autres titres composants cet album constituent une leçon de pop pour tous les groupes néo-pop comme Blur et Oasis pour ne citer que les plus populaires des années 90’s.\nMais Hélas, depuis la sortie de l'album \"Wasp Star\" en 2000, silence radio...\n\nAprès une nuit arrosée, un projet de \"groupe secret\" est évoqué par XTC. Ils enregistrent quelques chansons et oublient vite le projet. C'est un peu plus tard qu'il leur revient en tête et ils ont idée de faire une farce en enregistrant et en sortant un album, 25 O'Clock, sous le pseudonyme The Dukes of Stratosphear où ils laisseraient leurs influences et leur inspiration des groupes pop rock des années 60 (The Kinks, The Beach Boys, The Beatles...) prendre le dessus. Ils poussent même le jeu jusqu'à sortir cet album le premier avril ! Ils sont vite démasqués, mais certains critiques ont réellement cru à un groupe \"dinosaure\" tout droit sorti des 60's! L'album sera un \"succès\", vendu à 30 000 exemplaires et salué par la critique (deux fois mieux vendu que le dernier album d'XTC!). Un bon coup de pub pour le groupe qui ressortira un album sous le nom The Dukes of Stratosphear et dont on leur proposa même de faire un film basé sur l'idée de 25 O'Clock!",
