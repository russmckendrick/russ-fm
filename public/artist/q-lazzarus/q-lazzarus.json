  "biography": "Diane Luckey (born December 12, 1960), known professionally as Q Lazzarus, was an American female lead singer known for her husky bass voice. She is primarily known for the song 'Goodbye Horses' which is featured prominently in the 1990 thriller, 'Silence of the Lambs.' Before she was discovered as a singer, she worked as a taxi driver in New York City. \n\nQ was born in Neptune Township, New Jersey to James and WillaMae Luckey. At the age of 18, she moved to New York City and began work writing music for commercials and as a backup singer for Sigma Sound Studios. She formed Q Lazzarus and the Resurrection in the 1980s, consisting of herself on vocals, songwriter William Garvey, backup vocalist Gloriana Galicia, Janice Bernstein and Mark Barrett. Q Lazzarus was rejected by many record labels, claiming that she was unmarketable due to her dreadlocks.\n\nQ had met director Jonathan Demme while working as a taxi driver. Upon hearing her demo tape, Demme would include ''The Candle Goes Away' in his 1986 movie 'Something Wild'. Her music would go on to appear in multiple of Demme's movies, 'Goodbye Horses' most notably appeared in 'Married to the Mob' and 'Silence of the Lambs', the latter bringing the track great attention. She also appeared in 'Philadelphia', performing 'Heaven' by fellow NYC band Talking Heads. \n\nQ Lazzarus and the Resurrection disbanded in 1996, Q herself disappearing from the public eye shortly afterwards. William Garvey later passed away in 2009.\n\nIn 2017, Mon Amie Records reissued Goodbye Horses on vinyl, alongside previously unreleased material sourced from a recovered demo tape.\n\nIn 2018, A Twitter account claiming to be Q would contact musician Kelsey Zimmerman in response to a Dazed article claiming that she had passed away. They would write “Hi, sorry to bother you. I just wanted people to know I am still alive, I have no interest in singing anymore. I am a bus driver in Staten Island (I have been for YEARS), I see hundreds of passengers everyday so I am hardly hiding (or dead!), I have given Thomas Gorton (Dazed) my fone number and address just to confirm I am ‘real’, sorry if this is a boring end to the story, I am going to come off twitter soon as I find it odd, please take note of this message incase anyone else is interested. THANK YOU”. The story was confirmed as legitimate due to public records of a lawsuit Q filed against a Staten Island bus company due to refusing to hire female drivers.\n\nIn August 2019, she began working with filmmaker Eva Aridjis on 'Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus', a documentary about her life and career. The documentary is due for release in 2025, alongside Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus (Music From The Motion Picture) via Sacred Bones Records, a soundtrack consisting of unreleased material.\n\nQ Lazzarus passed away on July 19th, 2022 of an undisclosed illness. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Q+Lazzarus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
