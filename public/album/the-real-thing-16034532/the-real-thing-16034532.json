      "biography": "Faith No More are an American alternative metal band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1979. Before settling on the current name in July 1983, the band performed under the names Sharp Young Men and later Faith No Man. Bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Roddy Bottum and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest-remaining members of the band, having been involved since its inception. The band underwent several early lineup changes, and some major changes later. The current lineup of Faith No More consists of Gould, Bordin, Bottum, lead guitarist Jon Hudson, and vocalist/lyricist Mike Patton.\n\nAfter releasing six studio albums, including best-selling records The Real Thing (1989) and Angel Dust (1992), Faith No More officially announced its breakup on April 20, 1998. The band has since reunited, conducting The Second Coming Tour between 2009 and 2010, and releasing its seventh studio album, Sol Invictus, in May 2015. After the touring cycle of Sol Invictus, Faith No More went on hiatus once again. In November 2019, the band announced that it would reunite to embark on a 2020 UK and European tour, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was postponed. Touring was due to recommence with a brief US tour in September 2021, followed by the previously postponed UK and Europe dates in June 2022, but all tour dates were cancelled with Patton citing mental health reasons.\n\nStudio albums\nWe Care a Lot (1985)\nIntroduce Yourself (1987)\nThe Real Thing (1989)\nAngel Dust (1992)\nKing for a Day...

It was the first release by the band not to feature vocalist Chuck Mosely; instead the album featured Mike Patton from the experimental rock band Mr. Bungle. On this album, Faith No More advanced their sound range combining heavy metal, progressive rock, hip hop, funk, jazz, and soul.\n\nAlthough released in mid 1989, The Real Thing didn't enter the Billboard 200 until February 1990, after the release of the second single from the album, \"Epic\", and eventually peaked at number eleven on the chart in October 1990, following the the reissue of \"Epic\" almost a year and half after the initial release of the album.

A demo version of \"The Morning After\", under the moniker \"New Improved Song\", with alternate lyrics written and sung by Chuck Mosely was released on the Sounds·Waves 2 extended play with the Sounds magazine. \"Surprise! You're Dead!\" was composed by Jim Martin in the 1970s, while he was guitarist for Agents of Misfortune who also featured Cliff Burton in the line up. The recording of the music took place in December 1988 following Chuck Mosely's removal from the band and was completed prior to the hiring of Mike Patton, who then wrote all the lyrics for the songs and recorded them the following month over the music.\n\nThe recording sessions also garnered several songs that didn't feature on the album two of which, \"The Grade\" and \"The Cowboy Song\", later appeared on the singles and on the UK edition of Live at the Brixton Academy. A third song, \"Sweet Emotion\", was later rerecorded with different lyrics as \"The Perfect Crime\" for the soundtrack to the film that also starred a cameo appearance from guitarist Jim Martin, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. The original recording having only featured on Flexible Fiend 3 with Kerrang! magazine issue 258.\n\n    * \"From out of Nowhere\" has been used in the video games Madden NFL 2005 and NHL 2005.\n    * \"Epic\" was featured on video games Rock Band, Burnout Paradise, SingStar and also appeared in a commercial for the console versions of Street Fighter IV, with the announcer stating about the game's \"epic return\".\n    * \"Falling to Pieces\" was featured on the film Black Hawk Down.\n    * \"Surprise!
