      "biography": "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as \"the King of Rock and Roll\", or simply, \"the King\".\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, as a twinless twin, and when he was 13 years old, he and his family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popular—and controversial.\nIn November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42.\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, blues and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.",

Consider that RCA released its first Elvis greatest-hits album in March 1958—the 14-track <i>Elvis’ Golden Records</i>—and then put out this second volume in November 1959. (The a- and b-sides issued in 1958 and 1959 with “Hard Headed Woman” and “Don’t Ask Me Why” were left off due to their inclusion on the <i>King Creole</i> soundtrack the prior year.) In the late ’50s, even Presley’s b-sides charted in the Top 40. Whereas the albums of his Army period—<i>For LP Fans Only</i>, <i>A Date with Elvis</i>—raided the vaults for his sessions at Sun Records, the singles here were all new tracks recorded either several months before Elvis departed or during one of his rare weekends of Army leave. Contrary to some rumours, Presley wasn’t showing signs of mellowing. Songs such as “I Got Stung”, “One Night” and “A Big Hunk O’ Love” are as ferocious in their own way as the tracks he cut at Sun Records and in his first few years at RCA.",
