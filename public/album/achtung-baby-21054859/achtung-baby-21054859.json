      "biography": "U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976. The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.\n\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, War (1983), and singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, The Unforgettable Fire (1984), was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, whose influence resulted in the band experimenting with a more abstract, ambient sound. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Their fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date: \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\".\n\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album, Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991) and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on their eighth album, Zooropa (1993), and concluded following their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Although their twelfth album, No Line on the Horizon (2009), did not meet commercial expectations, their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour, both of which stood until 2019. In the 2010s, U2 released the companion albums Songs of Innocence (2014) and Songs of Experience (2017), the former of which received criticism for its pervasive, no-cost release through the iTunes Store. Their most recent album, Songs of Surrender (2023), consists of reimagined versions of 40 songs from their career.\n\nU2 have released 15 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, working with organisations and coalitions that include Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, DATA/the ONE Campaign, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.",

      "editorial_notes": "U2’s most transformative album—the one that would re-jigger the band’s sound, re-energise its members and win over even the band’s fiercest critics—began with a vague promise from Bono. On December 30, 1989, during a homecoming performance in Ireland, the U2 frontman bid farewell to the  ’80s by declaring that his world-conquering band was taking a sabbatical from stardom. “We have to go away,” Bono announced, “and just dream it all up again.”\n\nThe hasty retreat made sense, given the response to 1988’s highly hyped <i>Rattle and Hum</i>, an ambitious double album (and documentary film) that found U2 travelling through America in search of new sounds—and, to some observers, wallowing in self-seriousness. The band had always prompted its fair share of eye-rolling, but <i>Rattle and Hum</i> gave the group’s detractors even more ammo: Gospel choirs? Folk songs? <i>Just who do these U2 guys think they are?</i>\n\nThe band members were wondering the same thing. So in 1990, they decamped to Germany, hoping the recent fall of the Berlin Wall could be the backdrop for a future-focused burst of creativity. Instead, the four band members—Bono, guitarist the Edge, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam Clayton—began sparring in the studio, torn over what the ’90s version of U2 should sound like. The Edge, in particular, was fascinated by the noisy new wave of industrial artists like Nine Inch Nails and KMFDM—acts whose menace and aggression were far removed from U2’s brand of guitar-starred anthems.\n\nNot everyone was sold on the idea of a more aggro, less earnest version of U2. But the push and pull of the <i>Achtung Baby</i> sessions—which were later continued in Dublin—would result in 12 tracks of buzzsaw rock that sound as though they’d been created by a different band altogether. The album’s lead single, “The Fly”, is a grimy dance-floor come-on anchored by Clayton and Mullen’s strange new rhythms. And on “Mysterious Ways”, the Edge trades in his familiar clean-lined guitar-jangle for a hazy funk that sounds like it’s being played through a dial-up modem.\n\nAs for Bono: He’s never been as loose as he is here—nor as libidinous. On both the kaleidoscopic “Until the End of the World'' and the clanging “Zoo Station”, he adopts a winking, playfully skeevy persona—the perfect guise for the ironic ’90s. Yet the clear-eyed bluntness that propelled U2 to infamy in the ’80s was still intact, most notably on “One”, a soulful ode to reconciliation that would become one of the biggest songs of U2’s career.\n\nLess than two years after U2 vowed to “dream it all up again”, <i>Achtung Baby</i> delivered on that big promise—maintaining all the vigour and fervour of the band’s early years, while flirting with sounds that would soon define radio: trip-hop, shoegaze, electro-pop. This album wasn’t <i>Rattle and Hum</i>—it was pure <i>Sturm und Drang</i>. And for once, the group’s most loyal fans—as well as its most exhausted critics—could agree: This souped-up, super-improved U2 2.0 was even better than the real thing.",

            "content": "Achtung Baby is the seventh studio album by Irish rock band U2, released on 19 November 1991. The album arrived nearly two years after lead vocalist Bono announced the band would have to \"go away and dream it all up again\", following the mixed response to 1988's Rattle and Hum. While recording Achtung Baby, there was a rift between band members over the direction of the band's sound. Tensions almost prompted U2 to break-up until the band rallied around the writing of the album's hit One.\n\nThe album marks a dramatic change in the band's image and sound, with the band being heavily influenced by alternative rock and electronic music. Their music also features more detailed production, more guitar effects, and darker, more personal lyrical content. The results were considerably more adventurous than their previous efforts, yet Achtung Baby was very commercially and critically successful, winning a Grammy Award and having sold approximately 18 million copies worldwide. In 2003, the album was ranked number 62 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe band embarked on the elaborately-staged, multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour to support the album.\n\nHistory\nAchtung Baby was a departure for the band. Bono has often described the album as \"the sound of four men trying to chop down The Joshua Tree\". U2 sampled techniques and sounds from other musical genres previously unused by the band, including dance, house and electronica, whilst maintaining their original feel of rock and roll.\n\nThe album's new sound was a source of conflict in the band because The Edge and Bono favored the new sounds they were coming up with while recording their sessions in Berlin, while drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam Clayton were partial to the band's traditional sound. The conflict amongst the members of U2 very nearly led to the band breaking up, but the fighting subdued after The Edge, struggling with two bridge sections for the song Ultraviolet (Light My Way) was encouraged to combine them by the band and producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. The band rallied around the riff and was inspired to write the song One. It changed the band's outlook on the album, helping bring them back from the brink during recording sessions. One was responsible for a renewed sense of optimism towards the material they had already recorded. Leaving Berlin on a high note, the band was able to complete the rest of the album in Dublin.\n\nAchtung Baby was also darker sounding than previous efforts, thanks in large part to songs such as The Fly, Acrobat, and Love Is Blindness, which deal with themes of helplessness, broken relationships, and (in the case of Love Is Blindness) violence in the name of love. The spiritual yearning of U2's 1980s work began to take on a more existential, despairing element in Achtung Baby. The band's political activism moved to the AIDS crisis and environmental issues. At the same time, the band also took on a lighter tone, electing to use irony rather than earnestness in its music and public appearances, and poking fun at its own self-importance during the 1980s. This evolving outlook culminated in the pleaful soul-searching (and jaded skewering of contemporary life) on 1997's Pop and would not subside until the more hopeful tracks on 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind.\n\nOther tracks included the distorted opener Zoo Station, the danceable single Even Better Than The Real Thing, and the thumping rocker (and future live favourite) Until the End of the World, written for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders' eponymous 1991 science fiction film. The song may be an allegorical afterlife confession of Judas Iscariot.\n\nAchtung Baby expanded the group's fanbase. New fans were perhaps drawn in by the hit song Mysterious Ways and the ballad One.\n\nThe album was followed by the Zoo TV Tour, a ground-breaking and, in Zoo TV: Live from Sydney, Grammy-award winning multimedia concert production.\n\nThe U.S. LP is the only American release to contain the uncensored picture of bassist Adam Clayton naked. On the U.S. CD and cassette, his private parts are censored with a black \"X\" or a four-leaf clover.\n\nAs for the album's title, \"Achtung, Baby!\" in German means \"Attention, baby!\" or \"Careful, baby!\" Frequently used by the band's engineers during the making of the album, the phrase came from the Mel Brooks film The Producers.\n\nAchtung Baby was the first of 9 albums to feature 3 songs to reach the top of the Modern Rock Tracks.\n\nReception\nOn the Billboard Music Charts (North America), Achtung Baby topped the Billboard 200 chart selling 295,000 copies in its first week. It won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Rolling Stone magazine declared that U2 had \"proven that the same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock & roll.\"\n\nThe album is frequently cited as one of the greatest in rock history. In 1998 Q magazine readers voted Achtung Baby the 15th greatest album of all time; in 2001 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 65. Also in 2003, Q declared its third track, One, \"the greatest recorded song of all time\". In 2003, the album was ranked number 62 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was voted #11 on Spin's \"Best Albums of the Last 25 Years\" list. In a 2007 VH1 countdown, One was named the #2 on its list of \"Songs of the 1990s\". Entertainment Weekly named Achtung Baby the #3 album of the last 25 years.\n\nStudio bootlegs\n\nU2 entered the studio in late 1990 and began recording the album before they had written any material, mainly improvising and developing ideas into songs. The more interesting ideas were preserved on working tapes. In April 1991, these tapes fell into the hands of bootleggers, well before the album's November release date. The most widely circulated compilation of these tapes is the three-disc Salomé: The Axtung Beibi Outtakes, released in February 1992. Another bootleg surfaced, entitled, The Achtung Sessions in 1993.\n\nLater that same year, another single disc bootleg of the tapes was distributed underground. Called , this single disc contained material of songs that were near completion. Most notably; Heaven and Hell, The Darkest Night, and Blow Your House Down. Interestingly, none of the \"Salome\" mixes were included on this disc.\n\nSince these songs were leaked very early in the production process, they provide a rare insight into the band's songwriting process. On the same note, many of the ideas—including eight different takes of the song \"Salomé\"—were frustratingly undeveloped, so the bootleg remains a curiosity strictly for hardcore fans. Bono says, \"There were no undiscovered works of genius, unfortunately, it was more just gobbledy-gook.\"\n\nSome of the ideas were revisited—there are, for instance, early instrumental versions of Even Better Than the Real Thing and North and South of the River (the latter of which wouldn't be recorded by the band until 1997)—and one song—the B-side Where Did It All Go Wrong?—was even officially released as a rough composite of the two takes available on the bootleg. There are also a handful of developed ideas that were wholly abandoned, such as She's Gonna Blow Your House Down, a song the group had been working on since the Rattle and Hum days.\n\nVideo\nFollowing the successful release of the album, U2 released Achtung Baby: The Videos, The Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from Zoo TV, a VHS compilation of music videos from the album. The compilation featured nine videos, including three videos for both One and Even Better than the Real Thing. In between the videos were clips of \"interference\" — documentary footage, media clips, and other images, similar to what was shown at shows during the Zoo TV Tour. The videos for Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses and Love Is Blindness were the only videos from the album not included on this release, as they were not released until after the compilation's release.\n\nProfessional Reviews\nAllMusic - ★★★★★\nRolling Stone - ★★★★☆\nThe Boston Globe\nEntertainment Weekly\nTrouser Press <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/U2/Achtung+Baby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
