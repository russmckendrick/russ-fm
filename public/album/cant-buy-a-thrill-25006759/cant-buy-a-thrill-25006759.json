      "biography": "Steely Dan is an American jazz rock band which formed in 1972. The band was formed by Donald Fagen (vocals, keyboards) and Walter Becker (guitar, bass), who met in 1967 while both attended Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, and began a songwriting partnership shortly thereafter.\n\nTheir music is characterized by dark, witty lyrical narratives, obscure lyrical allusions and complex, jazz-influenced instrumentation and chord sequences, overlying more ordinary popular song structures. Their fastidious standards in the studio and use of world-class sessions players has also been a hallmark of their work. For this, special credit should be given to their long-time producer Gary Katz and engineer Roger Nichols.  \n\nThe band was originally a six-piece consisting of Fagen, Becker, David Palmer (vocals), Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter (guitar), Denny Dias (guitar) and Jim Hodder (drums), but by 1975, only Fagen and Becker remained.\n\nThe band's history can be divided into three stages. In its original conception, the group was a relatively conventional rock band that toured from 1972 to 1974, releasing the singles-chart successes, 'Do It Again', 'Reelin' in the Years', 'My Old School' and 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number'. The group's name was derived from a series of dildos in the 1959 novel, 'Naked Lunch' by the avant-garde writer, William S. Burroughs; the phrase first used in the lyrics of an early, pre-Steely Dan Fagen/Becker song, Soul Ram.\n\nIn its second stage (1975 - 1980) the group, now consisting solely of Fagen and Becker, became a purely studio-based act, their album releases showing a growing obsession with polished production values, and whose output became increasingly jazz-orientated, culminating in the highly successful 'Aja' (1977) and 'Gaucho' (1980). The two split in 1981 following a tumultuous recording process for the latter album, and personal problems for both members.\n\nIn the Eighties, Fagen released his seminal debut album, 'The Nightfly', and took time away from the music industry, whilst Becker, after recovering from drug dependence, was in frequent work as a producer.\n\nThe third stage came when Fagen and Becker reunited in 1993, followed by a world tour (their first touring dates in 20 years). In 2000, the Grammy-award-winning 'Two Against Nature' was released to critical and surprising commercial success. Its successor followed swiftly, 'Everything Must Go' being released in 2003. The two albums show a more relaxed attitude to production, less morbid lyrical themes and an upbeat jazz pop sound, but  with the characteristic wit and musical complexity of their 20th century work remaining. \n\nWalter Becker passed away on September 3, 2017.  This was followed by legal action between Becker's estate and Fagen over ownership of material.  Fagen with additional bandmates continues to tour as Steely Dan.\n\n--\nSteely Dan's homepage\nWikipedia article <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steely+Dan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "On the one hand, Steely Dan’s 1972 debut album is home to some of the most definitive and best-known songs in 1970s American rock; on the other, it’s barely a glimpse of where the band went next. Having bonded over Beat poetry and 1950s jazz—not to mention a shared sense of humour so dry and bitter, it stings more than a half-century later—college students Donald Fagen and Walter Becker tried their hand at selling pop songs to others before effectively realising nobody was weird enough to play their music but them. The Steely Dan sound was too restrained to qualify as jazz, too sophisticated to count as rock and too obscure to be categorised as pop. Yet on <i>Can’t Buy a Thrill</i>, Fagen and Becker managed to stretch the parameters of all three genres in ways that made the group seem totally (if quietly) radical compared to most of what was going on the radio at the time.\n\nAs the duo put it in the album’s belated liner notes, Fagen and Becker had arrived in California with a book of songs that had to be “adjusted and refined to take into account the new musical environment in which we found ourselves operating, and also to reflect our belated understanding of the aesthetic shortcomings of some of our less-than-accessible, more doggedly surrealist efforts.” For the English speakers out there, that translates into such radio-dominating <i>Can’t Buy a Thrill</i> breakthroughs as “Do It Again”, “Reelin’ In the Years” and “Dirty Work.”\n\nAs successful as the album became, it also established Steely Dan as a kind of cult band subversively worming their way through the digestive tract of commercial pop. These were the guys in the corner snickering about something the rest of the party didn’t and couldn’t understand. But while Fagen and Becker may have been arrogant, they were also outcasts. One former tour mate described the duo as the Manson and Starkweather of rock ’n’ roll, a reference to Charles Manson and the spree killer Charles Starkweather (for their part, Fagen and Becker later joked that they weren’t sure who was supposed to be which). When punk, with all its cynicism and sarcasm, came into the picture later in the decade, you’d have to squint to see its resemblance to Steely Dan. But on <i>Can’t Buy a Thrill</i>, it’s definitely there: “You been tellin’ me you’re a genius since you were 17,” Fagen sneers on “Reelin’ in the Years”. “In all the time I’ve known you I still don’t know what you mean.”",

          "standard": "On the one hand, Steely Dan’s 1972 debut album is home to some of the most definitive and best-known songs in 1970s American rock; on the other, it’s barely a glimpse of where the band went next. Having bonded over Beat poetry and 1950s jazz—not to mention a shared sense of humour so dry and bitter, it stings more than a half-century later—college students Donald Fagen and Walter Becker tried their hand at selling pop songs to others before effectively realising nobody was weird enough to play their music but them. The Steely Dan sound was too restrained to qualify as jazz, too sophisticated to count as rock and too obscure to be categorised as pop. Yet on <i>Can’t Buy a Thrill</i>, Fagen and Becker managed to stretch the parameters of all three genres in ways that made the group seem totally (if quietly) radical compared to most of what was going on the radio at the time.\n\nAs the duo put it in the album’s belated liner notes, Fagen and Becker had arrived in California with a book of songs that had to be “adjusted and refined to take into account the new musical environment in which we found ourselves operating, and also to reflect our belated understanding of the aesthetic shortcomings of some of our less-than-accessible, more doggedly surrealist efforts.” For the English speakers out there, that translates into such radio-dominating <i>Can’t Buy a Thrill</i> breakthroughs as “Do It Again”, “Reelin’ In the Years” and “Dirty Work.”\n\nAs successful as the album became, it also established Steely Dan as a kind of cult band subversively worming their way through the digestive tract of commercial pop. These were the guys in the corner snickering about something the rest of the party didn’t and couldn’t understand. But while Fagen and Becker may have been arrogant, they were also outcasts. One former tour mate described the duo as the Manson and Starkweather of rock ’n’ roll, a reference to Charles Manson and the spree killer Charles Starkweather (for their part, Fagen and Becker later joked that they weren’t sure who was supposed to be which). When punk, with all its cynicism and sarcasm, came into the picture later in the decade, you’d have to squint to see its resemblance to Steely Dan. But on <i>Can’t Buy a Thrill</i>, it’s definitely there: “You been tellin’ me you’re a genius since you were 17,” Fagen sneers on “Reelin’ in the Years”. “In all the time I’ve known you I still don’t know what you mean.”"

            "content": "Can’t Buy a Thrill is the first album by Steely Dan. Originally released in 1972, the album was a huge success. It went gold, and then platinum, peaking at #17 on the charts. In 2003, the album was ranked number 238 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Two songs were left out from the album and released as a single (“Dallas” and “Sail the Waterway”), but to date they have not been released on CD.\n\nThe album was originally released in two-channel Stereo and also in a special four-channel Quadrophonic mix. There are some significant musical differences between the two mixes, such as extra lead guitar fills in the Quad mix of Reelin’ in the Years.\n\nThe album cover features a line of prostitutes standing in a red light area waiting for clients, an image which was chosen because of its relevance to the album title. The title is taken from a line from Bob Dylan’s song “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry”. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steely+Dan/Can%27t+Buy+A+Thrill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
