      "editorial_notes": "In the wake of the EU Referendum, Damon Albarn decided to travel around Britain to get a sense of a nation plunged into dramatic change. After reconvening with his The Good, the Bad & the Queen bandmates—Paul Simonon, Tony Allen and Simon Tong—those meditative journeys fed into their second album, <i>Merrie Land</i>. It’s an impressionistic portrait of a conflicted, confused land, with funfair organs, choirs and tugging melodies folded into eerie but beautiful blends of folk, dub and pop. Albarn talks Apple Music through his pilgrimage and the “strange emotions” that inform the album.<br />\n<b>It’s hard not to feel real sadness listening to this record. Is that the point?</b>\nI think so, maybe, but I think it’s, if you could call something this, a beautiful sadness. I don’t know what that kind of means. <br />\n<b>On the title track, you sing, “This is not rhetoric/It comes from my heart/I love this country.” This record is trying to not be angry or bitter or take sides, right?</b>\nNo, no, no, I’m not trying to break the family up. I’m trying to be honest and deal with those strange emotions, like love of place. Even though I’ve travelled, it’s fair to say, around the whole world, I always come back home. What’s driven me as a creative person to explore other climes and cultures is what I grew up with in this country. That was what’s special about this country: the sense of openness. That’s what we’re missing with all this hastiness to get stuff done because we decided we had to get it done by this point. That’s all I feel.<br />\n<b>You visited various parts of Britain to get a sense of the nation, going beyond the big cities to towns, including ones from British folk tales such as Banbury. Is this record your pilgrimage?</b>\nI’d never been to St. Albans or Luton or Banbury. I hadn’t even really been to Oxford. There were things I was very aware of—big cultural landmarks—that I’d never visited. So, in that sense, <i>pilgrimage</i> is a good description. I found ghosts everywhere. <i>Merrie Land</i> is a ghostly record. You just have to tune into the dissonance and the resonance in each place and work from there, especially if we’re going to try and give an impression. <br />\n<b>The songs take us from train rides past World War I cemeteries in France to heavy nights in Blackpool pubs. You’ve packed a lot in here.</b>\nYeah! I’ve never written so many lyrics, so that was a breakthrough for me. It’s something I’d like to explore—more words. I suppose it goes back to Jack Kerouac. Back to Betjeman on the train, it’s got a strong sense of kinship with that, and people like Patrick Hamilton and George Orwell.<br />\n<b>Three weeks before the release of <i>Merrie Land</i> you were still on tour with Gorillaz. How easy is it to switch between bands?</b>\nI just love making music, so it’s not that difficult. I had a strange four days: I finished the massive, euphoric gig in Mexico City [with Gorillaz] and then came back to a little room [in the UK] to rehearse for eight hours and go on national television. The only thing I regret is that we didn’t have a “work in progress” sign hanging over the microphone stand. Or cones and tape round us. We should’ve been wearing hi-vis jackets: “We haven’t quite built this place yet, but we’re definitely working at it.”",

It was produced by Tony Visconti and released on 16 November 2018.\nThe band announced the album with the single \"Merrie Land\" and news that they would embark on a five-date tour of the UK in early December 2018. In an interview for The Scotsman, Albarn commented that the album is \"a reluctant goodbye letter” to the European Union following Brexit, and \"a series of observations and reflections on Britishness in 2018.\" A video released for \"Merrie Land\" featured Albarn dressed as a ventriloquist's dummy singing and gesturing in front of a backdrop of pastoral images and English landscapes.\nThe band released the second single from the album, \"Gun to the Head\", on 5 November 2018. The track features \"organ, bassoon, recorder, and a British Invasion-style ensemble pop hook  lend the song a cheery boardwalk shine, undercut by Albarn's knotty lyrics of conspiratorial and repressive governance.\" The video released for \"Gun to the Head\" also featured Albarn dressed as a ventriloquist's dummy, but with backup dummies and a black backdrop. Three additional \"warm-up shows\" for the band in late November 2018 were announced alongside the release of the second single and its video.\nSessions for the album started in January 2017, when Albarn, Simonon and Tong spent time in Blackpool, which was originally going to be its main focus. However, Albarn expanded the focus of the album over the next two years while touring with Gorillaz for the albums Humanz and The Now Now.\nIn an interview with The Guardian, the band members admitted that Merrie Land shares creative attributes with its predecessor, The Good, the Bad & the Queen, but stylistically the two are dissimilar. Simonon characterised Merrie Land as \"modern English folk music with a bit of rub-a-dub in it\" while Allen noted \"this time around, people can dance\". The interview, conducted by music critic John Harris, focused on the album's inspiration in the Brexit vote, and how that impacted the themes on Merrie Land. Where the band's first album was \"murky\" in its depiction of London, Merrie Land \" the contorted confusion of Brexit\", and \"widens its focus beyond the capital and has an even sharper sense of place.\" Simonon also highlighted the album's title as \"kind of  to people's nostalgic, sentimental vision of how England used to be.
