  "biography": "Slade may have never truly caught on with global audiences (often narrow-mindedly deemed \"too British-sounding\"), but the group became a sensation in their homeland with their anthemic brand of glam rock in the early '70s, as they scored a staggering 11 Top Five hits in a four-year span from 1971 to 1974 (five of which topped the charts). Comprised of singer/guitarist Noddy Holder (born Neville Holder, June 15, 1946 in Walsall, Staffordshire, England), guitarist Dave Hill (born April 4, 1946, in Fleet Castle, Devon, England), bassist Jim Lea (born June 14, 1949, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England), and drummer Don Powell (born September 10, 1946, Bilston, Staffordshire, England), the group originally formed in the spring of 1966 under the name the In-Be-Tweens, playing out regularly with a mixture of soul and rock tracks. But besides a lone obscure single, \"You Better Run\" (penned by future Runaways svengali Kim Fowley), the band never issued any other recordings. By the end of '60s, the group had changed their name to Ambrose Slade and signed on with the Fontana label. They released Beginnings in 1969.   Soon after, the quartet hooked up with Animals bass player-turned-manager Chas Chandler (who had discovered Jimi Hendrix a few years prior), who promptly suggested the group shorten the name to just Slade and assume a \"skinhead\" look (Dr. Martin boots, shaved heads) as a gimmick.\n\nAfter several albums featuring few original compositions from the quartet came and went (1969's Beginnings, 1970's Play It Loud), the group began to write their own tunes, grew their hair long, and assumed the look of the then-burgeoning glam movement, joining the same cause championed by such fellow Brits as David Bowie and T. Rex. This new direction paid off in 1971 with the number 16 U.K. single \"Get Down and Get With It,\" which soon touched off a string of classic singles and led to Slade becoming one of the most beloved party bands back home. They released Slayed? in 1972. Slade also utilized another gimmick, humorously misspelled song titles, as evidenced by such singles as \"Coz I Luv You,\" \"Look Wot You Dun,\" \"Take Me Bak 'Ome,\" \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now,\" \"Gudbuy t'Jane,\" \"Cum on Feel the Noize,\" \"Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me,\" and \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" (the latter of which re-entered the charts every holiday season for years afterward). Several attempts at cracking the U.S. market came up empty (with track listings between their U.K. and U.S. full-lengths differing), although such albums as Slade Alive! and Slayed? are considered to be some of the finest albums of the glam era.\n\nSlade continued to score further hit singles back home, including such correctly spelled tracks as \"My Friend Stan,\" \"Everyday,\" \"Bangin' Man,\" \"Far Far Away,\" \"How Does it Feel,\" and \"In for a Penny,\" but with glam rock's dissolution and punk's emergence by the mid-'70s, the hits eventually dried up for the quartet. Despite the change in musical climate, Slade stuck to their guns and kept touring and releasing albums, as the title to their 1977 album, Whatever Happened to Slade, proved that the group's humor remained intact despite their fall from the top of the charts. A large, dedicated following still supported the group as they offered a performance at the 1980 Reading Festival that was considered one of the day's best, resulting in sudden renewed interest in the group back home and Slade scored their first true hit singles in six years with 1981's \"We'll Bring the House Down\" and \"Lock up Your Daughters.\"\n\nSlade received a boost stateside around this time as well, courtesy of the U.S. pop-metal outfit Quiet Riot, who made a smash hit out of \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" in 1983 that resulted in a strong chart showing for Slade's 1984 release Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply  (issued as The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome  in the U.K. a year earlier). Slade then enjoyed a pair of U.S. MTV/radio hits, \"Run Runaway\" and \"My Oh My.\" Holder and Lea also tried their hand at producing another artist around this time as well, as they manned the boards for Girlschool's 1983 release Play Dirty. Despite another all-new studio release, Rogues Gallery, and Quiet Riot covering another classic Slade tune (\"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\"), Slade was unable to retain their newfound American audience or rekindled British following and they eventually faded from sight once more, this time without a comeback waiting around the corner. During the '90s, a truncated version of the group dubbed Slade II was formed (without Holder or Lea in attendance), while Holder became a popular U.K. television personality as well as the host of his own '70s rock radio show. A 21-track singles compilation, Feel the Noize: The Very Best of Slade, was issued in 1997 (re-released under the simple title of Greatest Hits a couple of years later), which proved to be a popular release in England.\n\nDiscography\nBeginnings  (as Ambrose Slade, 1969)\nPlay It Loud (1970)\nSlayed?

With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", has sold in excess of one million copies.\r\n\r\nThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.\r\n\r\nThe group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.\r\n\r\nWhile Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, \"the one we kept returning to was Slade,\" and \"we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style\". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used \"every cheap trick in the book\", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song \"When the Lights are Out\" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" and \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.\r\n\r\nAfter Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name.",

With seventeen consecutive Top 20 hits and six number ones, the British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s. They were the first act to have three singles enter at #1, and all six of the Wolverhampton band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best selling single, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", has sold in excess of one million copies.\r\n\r\nThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music has also made mention of Holder's powerful vocals and guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense along with the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known.\r\n\r\nThe group started off as [a673208], as which they recorded two singles and built up a reputation on the nationwide touring circuit. They were reluctantly renamed [a=Ambrose Slade] to satisfy the terms of their new record deal with [l=Fontana Records]. They released one commercially unsuccessful LP under the Ambrose Slade name, before coming under the management of [a=Chas Chandler] who shortened the name to Slade.\r\n\r\nWhile Slade's attempts at cracking the United States market were largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on several US bands who cite Slade as an influence. [a=Kiss] bassist [a=Gene Simmons] admitted that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance style was influenced by Slade. In his book, Kiss and Make-Up, Simmons wrote on page 85, \"the one we kept returning to was Slade,\" and \"we liked the way they connected with the crowd, and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity. but we wanted it American-style\". [a=Tom Petersson] of [a=Cheap Trick] said on their From Tokyo to You DVD that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they used \"every cheap trick in the book\", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick covered the song \"When the Lights are Out\" (the original appeared on Old New Borrowed and Blue) on their 2009 release, The Latest. [a=Quiet Riot] had US hits with their covers of \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" and \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot dated back to the early 1970s, when [a=Kevin DuBrow] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearances at the Whisky a Go Go.\r\n\r\nAfter Lea and Holder left the band, the remaining members performed for some time as [a=Slade II] before returning to the original name.",

      "bio_content": "Slade may have never truly caught on with global audiences (often narrow-mindedly deemed \"too British-sounding\"), but the group became a sensation in their homeland with their anthemic brand of glam rock in the early '70s, as they scored a staggering 11 Top Five hits in a four-year span from 1971 to 1974 (five of which topped the charts). Comprised of singer/guitarist Noddy Holder (born Neville Holder, June 15, 1946 in Walsall, Staffordshire, England), guitarist Dave Hill (born April 4, 1946, in Fleet Castle, Devon, England), bassist Jim Lea (born June 14, 1949, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England), and drummer Don Powell (born September 10, 1946, Bilston, Staffordshire, England), the group originally formed in the spring of 1966 under the name the In-Be-Tweens, playing out regularly with a mixture of soul and rock tracks. But besides a lone obscure single, \"You Better Run\" (penned by future Runaways svengali Kim Fowley), the band never issued any other recordings. By the end of '60s, the group had changed their name to Ambrose Slade and signed on with the Fontana label. They released Beginnings in 1969.   Soon after, the quartet hooked up with Animals bass player-turned-manager Chas Chandler (who had discovered Jimi Hendrix a few years prior), who promptly suggested the group shorten the name to just Slade and assume a \"skinhead\" look (Dr. Martin boots, shaved heads) as a gimmick.\n\nAfter several albums featuring few original compositions from the quartet came and went (1969's Beginnings, 1970's Play It Loud), the group began to write their own tunes, grew their hair long, and assumed the look of the then-burgeoning glam movement, joining the same cause championed by such fellow Brits as David Bowie and T. Rex. This new direction paid off in 1971 with the number 16 U.K. single \"Get Down and Get With It,\" which soon touched off a string of classic singles and led to Slade becoming one of the most beloved party bands back home. They released Slayed? in 1972. Slade also utilized another gimmick, humorously misspelled song titles, as evidenced by such singles as \"Coz I Luv You,\" \"Look Wot You Dun,\" \"Take Me Bak 'Ome,\" \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now,\" \"Gudbuy t'Jane,\" \"Cum on Feel the Noize,\" \"Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me,\" and \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" (the latter of which re-entered the charts every holiday season for years afterward). Several attempts at cracking the U.S. market came up empty (with track listings between their U.K. and U.S. full-lengths differing), although such albums as Slade Alive! and Slayed? are considered to be some of the finest albums of the glam era.\n\nSlade continued to score further hit singles back home, including such correctly spelled tracks as \"My Friend Stan,\" \"Everyday,\" \"Bangin' Man,\" \"Far Far Away,\" \"How Does it Feel,\" and \"In for a Penny,\" but with glam rock's dissolution and punk's emergence by the mid-'70s, the hits eventually dried up for the quartet. Despite the change in musical climate, Slade stuck to their guns and kept touring and releasing albums, as the title to their 1977 album, Whatever Happened to Slade, proved that the group's humor remained intact despite their fall from the top of the charts. A large, dedicated following still supported the group as they offered a performance at the 1980 Reading Festival that was considered one of the day's best, resulting in sudden renewed interest in the group back home and Slade scored their first true hit singles in six years with 1981's \"We'll Bring the House Down\" and \"Lock up Your Daughters.\"\n\nSlade received a boost stateside around this time as well, courtesy of the U.S. pop-metal outfit Quiet Riot, who made a smash hit out of \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" in 1983 that resulted in a strong chart showing for Slade's 1984 release Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply  (issued as The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome  in the U.K. a year earlier). Slade then enjoyed a pair of U.S. MTV/radio hits, \"Run Runaway\" and \"My Oh My.\" Holder and Lea also tried their hand at producing another artist around this time as well, as they manned the boards for Girlschool's 1983 release Play Dirty. Despite another all-new studio release, Rogues Gallery, and Quiet Riot covering another classic Slade tune (\"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\"), Slade was unable to retain their newfound American audience or rekindled British following and they eventually faded from sight once more, this time without a comeback waiting around the corner. During the '90s, a truncated version of the group dubbed Slade II was formed (without Holder or Lea in attendance), while Holder became a popular U.K. television personality as well as the host of his own '70s rock radio show. A 21-track singles compilation, Feel the Noize: The Very Best of Slade, was issued in 1997 (re-released under the simple title of Greatest Hits a couple of years later), which proved to be a popular release in England.\n\nDiscography\nBeginnings  (as Ambrose Slade, 1969)\nPlay It Loud (1970)\nSlayed?

      "bio_summary": "Slade may have never truly caught on with global audiences (often narrow-mindedly deemed \"too British-sounding\"), but the group became a sensation in their homeland with their anthemic brand of glam rock in the early '70s, as they scored a staggering 11 Top Five hits in a four-year span from 1971 to 1974 (five of which topped the charts).
