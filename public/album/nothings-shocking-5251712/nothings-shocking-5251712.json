      "biography": "Jane's Addiction are an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1985. The band consists of vocalist Perry Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery.\n\nFounded by Farrell and original bass guitarist Eric Avery, following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band Psi Com, Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. Jane's Addiction's first release was a self-titled live album in 1987 and quickly caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The band's first two studio albums, Nothing's Shocking (1988) and Ritual de lo Habitual (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing cult fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the \"Alternative Nation\". The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival.\n\nThe band briefly reunited in 1997, with Flea, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, replacing Avery on bass guitar. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble—and later Chris Chaney—occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third studio album, Strays, before dissolving again the following year.\n\nIn 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Eric Avery, however, subsequently left the band in early 2010 as the group began working on new material. The band released its fourth studio album The Great Escape Artist in 2011, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour. In 2016, Jane's Addiction were nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n2024: Reunion tour, stage altercation and hiatus\n\nOn May 23, 2024, the classic Jane's Addiction line-up of Farrell, Navarro, Avery and Perkins performed at the 400-capacity Bush Hall in London, marking the first time the four-piece had performed together since 2010. The band debuted new material at the show, their first with Avery in thirty-four years, ahead of a full European tour. Both The Guardian and NME, awarded five-star reviews to the band's performance at London's Roundhouse, with The Guardian writing: \"They’ve not sounded this vivid and alive in decades. It might finally be time to believe in Jane's Addiction again – after all, they clearly do,\" and NME describing them as \"a force to be reckoned with\". Navarro said \"some of those UK club dates are among my favorite Jane’s Addiction shows that I’ve ever played\".\n\nJane's Addiction announced a US tour, with support from Love and Rockets, with whom the band had previously toured in 1987. On July 24, 2024, they released the single \"Imminent Redemption\", the first original song with Avery in 34 years. The band stated: \"It is different this time. To have everyone back together, releasing new music. It's time. Welcome to the next chapter of Jane's Addiction. 'Imminent Redemption' is only the beginning.\"The band confirmed that they had been working on several other new songs, with Avery saying he was \"guardedly optimistic\" that they could complete new music: \"The phrase that Dave and I were talking about the other day is: 'If there is a Jane's Addiction in 2025, then there will be new music for sure.' But you just never know if there's going to be a band at all.\"\n\nThe Guardian reported that there were tensions between band members when they played in New York City in September. On September 13, a concert at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston was cut short after Farrell shoved and punched Navarro and was restrained by the crew members. Farrell's wife, Etty Lau Farrell, said Farrell had been suffering from tinnitus and a sore throat and felt his voice was being drowned out by the band. The following day, Jane's Addiction issued an apology and canceled their scheduled show at Bridgeport, Connecticut. On September 16, they canceled the remainder of the tour and said they would \"take some time away as a group\". Navarro, Avery and Perkins released a joint statement attributing the cancellation to Farrell's behavior and mental health, while Farrell released an apology, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\".\n\nOn September 18, the band released a second new song with the reunited line-up, \"True Love\", which had been scheduled for release prior to the band's hiatus. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jane%27s+Addiction\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Nothing's Shocking is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band Jane's Addiction, released on August 23, 1988 through Warner Bros. Records. The album showcases the band's funk-oriented musical style through Dave Navarro's heavy guitar riffs and the distinctive singing style of vocalist Perry Farrell, and was one of the leading albums of the funk metal genre that made its breakthrough in the late 80's and 90's. Nothing's Shocking was well received by critics upon release and is often cited as the band's best album. Despite this, it peaked at number 103 on the Billboard 200 and produced only one noteworthy single, \"Jane Says\", which reached number six on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks in 1988. The album was ranked 305 on Rolling Stones' \"500 Greatest Albums of All-Time\"\n\nWarner Bros. gave Jane's Addiction a list of producers to choose from. The group chose Dave Jerden, whose work as engineer on the David Byrne and Brian Eno album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts frontman Perry Farrell appreciated. Jerden said he \"jumped\" at the chance to work with the group.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Farrell stated he wanted fifty percent of the band's publishing royalties for writing the lyrics, as well as a portion of the remaining half for writing music. Bassist Eric Avery said he and the other band members, guitarist Dave Navarro and drummer Stephen Perkins, were stunned by Farrell's demands. Farrell refused to compromise. One day Jerden drove up to the studio to find Farrell, Navarro, and Perkins leaving; Farrell told him that the band had broken up and that there would be no record. Warner Bros. called an emergency meeting to resolve the situation. Farrell got the royalty percentage he sought, and the other band members received 12.5 percent each. Avery said the incident had a profound effect on the band, creating an internal fracture.\n\nNot long after the royalties dispute, Farrell and Avery (who had formed the band together) had a falling out. This was the result of Avery's newfound sobriety as well as an incident where Farrell believed that the bassist had drunkenly tried to pick up his girlfriend. Tensions existed in the band between all the members during recording except for Perkins, who got along with Navarro, Avery and Farrell.\n\nThe songwriting process for Nothing's Shocking varied from song to song. Navarro noted, \"Some came from Eric's bass lines, some from guitar, some came from Perry, some came from drum riffs, and some just came from free-form jams. There was really no formula.\" Eric Avery wrote several songs, including \"Mountain Song\", \"Had a Dad\", \"Jane Says\", and \"Summertime Rolls\" (the latter two of which he also created the guitar parts for). With his songs, Avery came up with conceptual ideas for lyrics that Perry Farrell would then create the actual lyrics for; for example, \"Had a Dad\" dealt with Avery discovering he had a different biological father.\n\nPerry Farrell created the cover image to Nothing's Shocking, which features a pair of nude female Siamese twins sitting on a sideways rocking chair with their heads on fire. Farrell said the image, like much of his artwork, came to him in a dream.

      "wiki_content": "Nothing's Shocking is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band Jane's Addiction, released on August 23, 1988 through Warner Bros. Records. The album showcases the band's funk-oriented musical style through Dave Navarro's heavy guitar riffs and the distinctive singing style of vocalist Perry Farrell, and was one of the leading albums of the funk metal genre that made its breakthrough in the late 80's and 90's. Nothing's Shocking was well received by critics upon release and is often cited as the band's best album. Despite this, it peaked at number 103 on the Billboard 200 and produced only one noteworthy single, \"Jane Says\", which reached number six on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks in 1988. The album was ranked 305 on Rolling Stones' \"500 Greatest Albums of All-Time\"\n\nWarner Bros. gave Jane's Addiction a list of producers to choose from. The group chose Dave Jerden, whose work as engineer on the David Byrne and Brian Eno album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts frontman Perry Farrell appreciated. Jerden said he \"jumped\" at the chance to work with the group.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Farrell stated he wanted fifty percent of the band's publishing royalties for writing the lyrics, as well as a portion of the remaining half for writing music. Bassist Eric Avery said he and the other band members, guitarist Dave Navarro and drummer Stephen Perkins, were stunned by Farrell's demands. Farrell refused to compromise. One day Jerden drove up to the studio to find Farrell, Navarro, and Perkins leaving; Farrell told him that the band had broken up and that there would be no record. Warner Bros. called an emergency meeting to resolve the situation. Farrell got the royalty percentage he sought, and the other band members received 12.5 percent each. Avery said the incident had a profound effect on the band, creating an internal fracture.\n\nNot long after the royalties dispute, Farrell and Avery (who had formed the band together) had a falling out. This was the result of Avery's newfound sobriety as well as an incident where Farrell believed that the bassist had drunkenly tried to pick up his girlfriend. Tensions existed in the band between all the members during recording except for Perkins, who got along with Navarro, Avery and Farrell.\n\nThe songwriting process for Nothing's Shocking varied from song to song. Navarro noted, \"Some came from Eric's bass lines, some from guitar, some came from Perry, some came from drum riffs, and some just came from free-form jams. There was really no formula.\" Eric Avery wrote several songs, including \"Mountain Song\", \"Had a Dad\", \"Jane Says\", and \"Summertime Rolls\" (the latter two of which he also created the guitar parts for). With his songs, Avery came up with conceptual ideas for lyrics that Perry Farrell would then create the actual lyrics for; for example, \"Had a Dad\" dealt with Avery discovering he had a different biological father.\n\nPerry Farrell created the cover image to Nothing's Shocking, which features a pair of nude female Siamese twins sitting on a sideways rocking chair with their heads on fire. Farrell said the image, like much of his artwork, came to him in a dream. Farrell hired Warner Bros. employees to create the cover sculpture; after learning how to create sculptures by watching them closely, he fired the Warner Bros. staff and created the artwork himself. Farrell hired someone to help create a full body casting of his girlfriend for use as the sculptures. Retailers objected to the album's cover. Nine out of the eleven leading record store chains refused to carry Nothing's Shocking, and the record had to be issued covered with brown paper.\n\nNothing's Shocking was released in 1988. \"Mountain Song\" was released as a single; however, MTV refused to air the song's music video due to a scene containing nudity.
