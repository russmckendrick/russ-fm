  "biography": "The Sha La Das are an American pop band rooted in doo wop, blues and soul, featuring former band members of the late Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and Charles Bradley. Based in Brooklyn, NY, their début LP, Love In The Wind is set for a September 2018 release.\n\nThe band features four Schaldas: father Bill (who sang in vocal group, The Montereys, in the 1960s) and his sons Will a.k.a. Swivs (keyboards for Charles Bradley & His Extraordinaires), Paul (guitar & vocals for Paul and The Tall Trees, as well as Charles Bradley & His Extraordinaires) and Carmine. \n\nThere's something special when a family can meld voices in close harmony: The Everly Brothers had it, the Beach Boys had it, the Schaldas have it. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sha+La+Das\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
