  "biography": "Garrett Dutton (born October 3, 1972), better known as G. Love, is the frontman for the band G. Love & Special Sauce. \n\nBiography:\nDutton, the son of a banking lawyer, was born in the Society Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, and began playing guitar at age eight. He wrote his first song by the time he was in the ninth grade and began playing harmonica in a wire rack. Dutton credits Bob Dylan and John Hammond Jr., as well as the then-contemporary \"old school\" hip-hop sounds of Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Philadelphia's own Schoolly D, as influences. \nDutton, who attended high school at the private Germantown Friends School, began playing solo on the streets of Philadelphia. After one year at Skidmore College, also a private school, Dutton dropped out and relocated to Boston, working as a fundraiser for Peace Action and playing wherever and whenever he could. One of his few indoor gigs at this time was a Boston bar called The Tam O'Shanter, where he met drummer Jeffrey \"The Houseman\" Clemens in January 1993. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, they were joined a few months later by bassist Jim \"Jimi Jazz\" Prescott and became the house band on Mondays at The Plough and Stars in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \nThe \"G\" stands for Garrett as said in many radio interviews. He said in an interview that the \"Love\" was just there because it sounded right. \nG. Love featured Jack Johnson on his 1999 album Philadelphonic playing an early version of Jack Johnson's \"Rodeo Clowns\" when Jack was an unknown artist. Jack later featured the song on his 2003 album On and On. \nGarrett dated Tristan Prettyman and wrote the song \"Beautiful\" with her while they were dating. \nKnown nowadays for his live shows, he is often seen touring with Jack Johnson. As a producer, Johnson signed G. Love to his record label Brushfire Records. He has made appearances on the records of artists such as Slightly Stoopid and Donavon Frankenreiter. And also recently went on tour with Dave Matthews. \nIn 2009, he collaborated with Zap Mama on their album ReCreation, singing on the single \"Drifting.\" \nIn 2010, G. Love joined forces with The Avett Brothers who produced and are featured on his newest album \"Fixin' to Die\". The album was released under the Brushfire label on February 22, 2011. This album showcased G. Love's love of back road blues.",

      "biography_en": "Garrett Dutton (born October 3, 1972), better known as G. Love, is the frontman for the band G. Love & Special Sauce. \n\nBiography:\nDutton, the son of a banking lawyer, was born in the Society Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, and began playing guitar at age eight. He wrote his first song by the time he was in the ninth grade and began playing harmonica in a wire rack. Dutton credits Bob Dylan and John Hammond Jr., as well as the then-contemporary \"old school\" hip-hop sounds of Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Philadelphia's own Schoolly D, as influences. \nDutton, who attended high school at the private Germantown Friends School, began playing solo on the streets of Philadelphia. After one year at Skidmore College, also a private school, Dutton dropped out and relocated to Boston, working as a fundraiser for Peace Action and playing wherever and whenever he could. One of his few indoor gigs at this time was a Boston bar called The Tam O'Shanter, where he met drummer Jeffrey \"The Houseman\" Clemens in January 1993. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, they were joined a few months later by bassist Jim \"Jimi Jazz\" Prescott and became the house band on Mondays at The Plough and Stars in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \nThe \"G\" stands for Garrett as said in many radio interviews. He said in an interview that the \"Love\" was just there because it sounded right. \nG. Love featured Jack Johnson on his 1999 album Philadelphonic playing an early version of Jack Johnson's \"Rodeo Clowns\" when Jack was an unknown artist. Jack later featured the song on his 2003 album On and On. \nGarrett dated Tristan Prettyman and wrote the song \"Beautiful\" with her while they were dating. \nKnown nowadays for his live shows, he is often seen touring with Jack Johnson. As a producer, Johnson signed G. Love to his record label Brushfire Records. He has made appearances on the records of artists such as Slightly Stoopid and Donavon Frankenreiter. And also recently went on tour with Dave Matthews. \nIn 2009, he collaborated with Zap Mama on their album ReCreation, singing on the single \"Drifting.\" \nIn 2010, G. Love joined forces with The Avett Brothers who produced and are featured on his newest album \"Fixin' to Die\". The album was released under the Brushfire label on February 22, 2011. This album showcased G. Love's love of back road blues.",

      "bio_content": "G. Love & Special Sauce is an alternative blues band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Formed in 1992, the group (Garrett Dutton, better known as G. Love, Jeffrey Clemens on drums, Mark Boyce on keyboards, and Timo Shanko on bass) are known for their unique \"laid back\" blues sound.\n\nThe group released their self-titled first album in 1994 on Okeh/Epic, a subsidiary of Sony Music. On the strength of the single \"Cold Beverage\", in part due to MTV rotation, the album nearly went gold. After which, trying to capitalize on the success of the album, the group toured heavily, eventually landing a spot on the H.O.R.D.E. tour.\n\nIn 1995 they released their follow up album Coast to Coast Motel. Though it did not sell as well as the first album, it is generally considered among critics as the stronger of the two albums.\n\nOn tour following the release of the second album the group nearly broke up, due to bickering about finances. Deciding on a hiatus the three members went their separate ways, working on various side projects.\n\nBy October 1997 the group had reconciled their differences and released their third album, Yeah, It's That Easy, which along with their own work, showcased their collaboration with several other bands and musicians, including All Fellas Band, Philly Cartel, King's Court, and Dr. John. This soul-influenced album was more similar to their debut album than their previous release.\n\nSoon after G. Love & Special Sauce set out on another world tour, returning to Philadelphia in 1999 for the release of their fourth album, Philadelphonic. Philadelphonic was followed up with Electric Mile in 2001, an album that shows the wide-ranging influences of the group, incorporating hip-hop, funk, psychedlia, blues, and soul in equal and ambitious measure. Ever the road band, the release of \"Electric Mile\" was followed by extensive touring.\n\nBy 2004 and The Hustle, G. Love (with the help of his bandmates and others) went solo and had eased up a little on the kitchen sink approach, offering instead a cohesive, dry groove reminiscent of his earliest efforts. Hustle was also the first G. Love release under Jack Johnson's Brushfire Records banner; the two had been pals at least since Philadelphonic, which Johnson had been a guest on.\n\nSpecial Sauce did a series of shows in 2004 with Jack Johnson and fellow Brushfire artist Donavon Frankenreiter, and the trio also found time to issue a brief live EP, titled Some Live Songs.\n\nIn the summer 2005, the band was featured (along with the less well known Philly local Chuck Treece of 80's skate-rock band McRad) in an advertisement for the launch of Coca-Cola Zero, featuring the groups own unique version of the noted Coca-Cola advertising song I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.\n\nG. Love's 2nd electrical solo release Lemonade also included Special Sauce on some tracks. Jack Johnson, Tristan Prettyman, Ben Harper, Jasper, and Blackalicious also contrbuted. \n\nG. Love still continues to tour with the Special Sauce in the meantime. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/G.+Love+&+Special+Sauce\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Love & Special Sauce. \n\nBiography:\nDutton, the son of a banking lawyer, was born in the Society Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, and began playing guitar at age eight. He wrote his first song by the time he was in the ninth grade and began playing harmonica in a wire rack. Dutton credits Bob Dylan and John Hammond Jr., as well as the then-contemporary \"old school\" hip-hop sounds of Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Philadelphia's own Schoolly D, as influences. \nDutton, who attended high school at the private Germantown Friends School, began playing solo on the streets of Philadelphia. After one year at Skidmore College, also a private school, Dutton dropped out and relocated to Boston, working as a fundraiser for Peace Action and playing wherever and whenever he could. One of his few indoor gigs at this time was a Boston bar called The Tam O'Shanter, where he met drummer Jeffrey \"The Houseman\" Clemens in January 1993. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, they were joined a few months later by bassist Jim \"Jimi Jazz\" Prescott and became the house band on Mondays at The Plough and Stars in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \nThe \"G\" stands for Garrett as said in many radio interviews. He said in an interview that the \"Love\" was just there because it sounded right. \nG. Love featured Jack Johnson on his 1999 album Philadelphonic playing an early version of Jack Johnson's \"Rodeo Clowns\" when Jack was an unknown artist. Jack later featured the song on his 2003 album On and On. \nGarrett dated Tristan Prettyman and wrote the song \"Beautiful\" with her while they were dating. \nKnown nowadays for his live shows, he is often seen touring with Jack Johnson. As a producer, Johnson signed G. Love to his record label Brushfire Records. He has made appearances on the records of artists such as Slightly Stoopid and Donavon Frankenreiter. And also recently went on tour with Dave Matthews. \nIn 2009, he collaborated with Zap Mama on their album ReCreation, singing on the single \"Drifting.\" \nIn 2010, G. Love joined forces with The Avett Brothers who produced and are featured on his newest album \"Fixin' to Die\". The album was released under the Brushfire label on February 22, 2011. This album showcased G. Love's love of back road blues.",
