  "biography": "Prefab Sprout debuted in 1982 with their self-released single, \"Lions In My Own Garden: Exit Someone\" - songwriter Paddy McAloon wanted a song title where the first letters of the words spelled out Limoges, the French city where his former girlfriend was staying at the time. Music journalist Stuart Maconie described the track as \"enigmatic, melancholy, tuneful and therefore perfect for a jobless literature graduate with girlfriend problems\". Their debut album, Swoon, was released on the Kitchenware label in March 1984. The following album, the Thomas Dolby-produced Steve McQueen, (released in America as Two Wheels Good after McQueen's estate expressed their displeasure with the title) was highly praised by critics. Their Protest Songs album was recorded next, but was not released until 1989. It included the song \"Life of Surprises\", which later became the title track for their greatest hits compilation album.\nTheir biggest commercial success in the UK came with the 1988 single \"The King of Rock 'N' Roll\", taken from the album From Langley Park to Memphis. It reached No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, their only single to reach the Top 10. From Langley Park to Memphis included guest appearances from Stevie Wonder and Pete Townshend.\nIn 1990, Jordan: The Comeback, again produced by Thomas Dolby, was nominated for a BRIT Award. Though the music was more accessible than their earlier material, the lyrics and subject matter remained characteristically oblique and suggestive (McAloon has often cited Stephen Sondheim as an influence). McAloon has alluded in interviews to several albums-worth of songs that he has written but are unreleased/unrecorded including amongst others, concept albums based on the life of Michael Jackson (Behind the Veil), the history of the world (Earth: The Story So Far) and (Zorro the Fox) about a fictional superhero.\nTheir greatest hits, A Life of Surprises - The Best of Prefab Sprout, gave them their biggest US hit, \"If You Don't Love Me\", which spent several weeks in the Top 10 on the dance chart. McAloon joked in the album liner notes about the band's lack of touring over the past decade.\nPrefab Sprout released Andromeda Heights in the UK in 1997 and embarked on a short UK tour in 2000. This tour, and the subsequent album, did not feature Wendy Smith, who by this time had reportedly left the band. A double album anthology, the 38 Carat Collection was released by CBS in 1999 as the group was leaving the record label. Unexpectedly, the group's US label, Epic, belatedly reissued this set as The Collection in early 2001. Smith left the group during this period, after the birth of her first child.\nIn 2001 the band released The Gunman and Other Stories a concept album themed on the American Wild West. The opening track \"Cowboy Dreams\" was a hit for the British actor-singer Jimmy Nail. Though critically acclaimed, neither enjoyed major commercial success.\nAfter being diagnosed with a medical disorder that seriously impaired his vision, Paddy McAloon released the album I Trawl The Megahertz under his own name in 2003 on the EMI Liberty label. As of 2006, McAloon had suffered another setback: his hearing had deteriorated, reportedly due to Ménière's disease. In early 2007 a remastered Steve McQueen was released in a two-CD package, containing new versions of eight of the songs from the original album, in different arrangements performed by McAloon on acoustic guitar.\nPrefab Sprout's first album of new material since 2001, Let's Change the World with Music, was released on 7 September 2009. Reviews in the UK press were favourable (e.g. 5/5 in The Times, 4/5 in The Guardian, 4/5 in Record Collector). The release was also accompanied by a few interviews (e.g. Mojo).\nIn June 2013, a leak of ten previously unreleased songs on Soundcloud led to speculation that a new Prefab Sprout album was being recorded. A rumoured title was \"Trapdoor Melancholy.\" A proposed 7 October 2013 release date was subsequently confirmed on 14 July, with the official title given as Crimson/Red.\nCrimson/Red was indeed released on 7 October 2013. The album was made available on vinyl and CD on the Icebreaker records label. A limited edition box set featuring an interview CD was also released. 200 of these were available as signed copies. The album was a 100% Paddy McAloon effort, featuring no other members of Prefab Sprout. The lead single was \"The Best Jewel Thief in the World.\" A video for this track (produced by Tylar Cornak) was originally posted to Vimeo\n(wiki)",

      "biography_en": "Prefab Sprout debuted in 1982 with their self-released single, \"Lions In My Own Garden: Exit Someone\" - songwriter Paddy McAloon wanted a song title where the first letters of the words spelled out Limoges, the French city where his former girlfriend was staying at the time. Music journalist Stuart Maconie described the track as \"enigmatic, melancholy, tuneful and therefore perfect for a jobless literature graduate with girlfriend problems\". Their debut album, Swoon, was released on the Kitchenware label in March 1984. The following album, the Thomas Dolby-produced Steve McQueen, (released in America as Two Wheels Good after McQueen's estate expressed their displeasure with the title) was highly praised by critics. Their Protest Songs album was recorded next, but was not released until 1989. It included the song \"Life of Surprises\", which later became the title track for their greatest hits compilation album.\nTheir biggest commercial success in the UK came with the 1988 single \"The King of Rock 'N' Roll\", taken from the album From Langley Park to Memphis. It reached No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, their only single to reach the Top 10. From Langley Park to Memphis included guest appearances from Stevie Wonder and Pete Townshend.\nIn 1990, Jordan: The Comeback, again produced by Thomas Dolby, was nominated for a BRIT Award. Though the music was more accessible than their earlier material, the lyrics and subject matter remained characteristically oblique and suggestive (McAloon has often cited Stephen Sondheim as an influence). McAloon has alluded in interviews to several albums-worth of songs that he has written but are unreleased/unrecorded including amongst others, concept albums based on the life of Michael Jackson (Behind the Veil), the history of the world (Earth: The Story So Far) and (Zorro the Fox) about a fictional superhero.\nTheir greatest hits, A Life of Surprises - The Best of Prefab Sprout, gave them their biggest US hit, \"If You Don't Love Me\", which spent several weeks in the Top 10 on the dance chart. McAloon joked in the album liner notes about the band's lack of touring over the past decade.\nPrefab Sprout released Andromeda Heights in the UK in 1997 and embarked on a short UK tour in 2000. This tour, and the subsequent album, did not feature Wendy Smith, who by this time had reportedly left the band. A double album anthology, the 38 Carat Collection was released by CBS in 1999 as the group was leaving the record label. Unexpectedly, the group's US label, Epic, belatedly reissued this set as The Collection in early 2001. Smith left the group during this period, after the birth of her first child.\nIn 2001 the band released The Gunman and Other Stories a concept album themed on the American Wild West. The opening track \"Cowboy Dreams\" was a hit for the British actor-singer Jimmy Nail. Though critically acclaimed, neither enjoyed major commercial success.\nAfter being diagnosed with a medical disorder that seriously impaired his vision, Paddy McAloon released the album I Trawl The Megahertz under his own name in 2003 on the EMI Liberty label. As of 2006, McAloon had suffered another setback: his hearing had deteriorated, reportedly due to Ménière's disease. In early 2007 a remastered Steve McQueen was released in a two-CD package, containing new versions of eight of the songs from the original album, in different arrangements performed by McAloon on acoustic guitar.\nPrefab Sprout's first album of new material since 2001, Let's Change the World with Music, was released on 7 September 2009. Reviews in the UK press were favourable (e.g. 5/5 in The Times, 4/5 in The Guardian, 4/5 in Record Collector). The release was also accompanied by a few interviews (e.g. Mojo).\nIn June 2013, a leak of ten previously unreleased songs on Soundcloud led to speculation that a new Prefab Sprout album was being recorded. A rumoured title was \"Trapdoor Melancholy.\" A proposed 7 October 2013 release date was subsequently confirmed on 14 July, with the official title given as Crimson/Red.\nCrimson/Red was indeed released on 7 October 2013. The album was made available on vinyl and CD on the Icebreaker records label. A limited edition box set featuring an interview CD was also released. 200 of these were available as signed copies. The album was a 100% Paddy McAloon effort, featuring no other members of Prefab Sprout. The lead single was \"The Best Jewel Thief in the World.\" A video for this track (produced by Tylar Cornak) was originally posted to Vimeo\n(wiki)",

Though critically acclaimed, and considered by many to have released some of the best pop albums of the decade, the band never matched this acclaim with commercial success. The band's best known lineup comprised Paddy McAloon (vocals, guitar, keyboard), Wendy Smith (vocals, guitar, keyboard), Martin McAloon (bass), and Neil Conti (drums).\n\nTheir biggest commercial and critical success came with 1990's Jordan: The Comeback (one of two albums produced by Thomas Dolby), which was a hit in the UK and nominated for a BRIT award. The band also had a UK Top 10 hit with their 1988 song The King of Rock 'n' Roll.\n\nPerhaps their finest album, Steve McQueen (originally released in June 1985) was re-released in August 2007 as a 2-CD deluxe edition, with a bonus disc of eight acoustic reinterpretations of some of the original tracks. Of the release, the record company said: \"Digitally remastered by original producer Thomas Dolby, the album is sounding even better than ever.  As if that weren't enough it is complemented here with a second disc containing eight sublime acoustic versions, which have been specially re-recorded for this release by Paddy McAloon.\"\n\nSteve McQueen was released in the US under the title Two Wheels Good following pressure from the late actor's estate.\n\nPrefab Sprout released Let's Change the World With Music - The Blueprint in 2009 on the Kitchenware Records label (website).

      "biography_en": "Prefab Sprout debuted in 1982 with their self-released single, \"Lions In My Own Garden: Exit Someone\" - songwriter Paddy McAloon wanted a song title where the first letters of the words spelled out Limoges, the French city where his former girlfriend was staying at the time. Music journalist Stuart Maconie described the track as \"enigmatic, melancholy, tuneful and therefore perfect for a jobless literature graduate with girlfriend problems\". Their debut album, Swoon, was released on the Kitchenware label in March 1984. The following album, the Thomas Dolby-produced Steve McQueen, (released in America as Two Wheels Good after McQueen's estate expressed their displeasure with the title) was highly praised by critics. Their Protest Songs album was recorded next, but was not released until 1989. It included the song \"Life of Surprises\", which later became the title track for their greatest hits compilation album.\nTheir biggest commercial success in the UK came with the 1988 single \"The King of Rock 'N' Roll\", taken from the album From Langley Park to Memphis. It reached No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, their only single to reach the Top 10. From Langley Park to Memphis included guest appearances from Stevie Wonder and Pete Townshend.\nIn 1990, Jordan: The Comeback, again produced by Thomas Dolby, was nominated for a BRIT Award. Though the music was more accessible than their earlier material, the lyrics and subject matter remained characteristically oblique and suggestive (McAloon has often cited Stephen Sondheim as an influence). McAloon has alluded in interviews to several albums-worth of songs that he has written but are unreleased/unrecorded including amongst others, concept albums based on the life of Michael Jackson (Behind the Veil), the history of the world (Earth: The Story So Far) and (Zorro the Fox) about a fictional superhero.\nTheir greatest hits, A Life of Surprises - The Best of Prefab Sprout, gave them their biggest US hit, \"If You Don't Love Me\", which spent several weeks in the Top 10 on the dance chart. McAloon joked in the album liner notes about the band's lack of touring over the past decade.\nPrefab Sprout released Andromeda Heights in the UK in 1997 and embarked on a short UK tour in 2000. This tour, and the subsequent album, did not feature Wendy Smith, who by this time had reportedly left the band. A double album anthology, the 38 Carat Collection was released by CBS in 1999 as the group was leaving the record label. Unexpectedly, the group's US label, Epic, belatedly reissued this set as The Collection in early 2001. Smith left the group during this period, after the birth of her first child.\nIn 2001 the band released The Gunman and Other Stories a concept album themed on the American Wild West. The opening track \"Cowboy Dreams\" was a hit for the British actor-singer Jimmy Nail. Though critically acclaimed, neither enjoyed major commercial success.\nAfter being diagnosed with a medical disorder that seriously impaired his vision, Paddy McAloon released the album I Trawl The Megahertz under his own name in 2003 on the EMI Liberty label. As of 2006, McAloon had suffered another setback: his hearing had deteriorated, reportedly due to Ménière's disease. In early 2007 a remastered Steve McQueen was released in a two-CD package, containing new versions of eight of the songs from the original album, in different arrangements performed by McAloon on acoustic guitar.\nPrefab Sprout's first album of new material since 2001, Let's Change the World with Music, was released on 7 September 2009. Reviews in the UK press were favourable (e.g. 5/5 in The Times, 4/5 in The Guardian, 4/5 in Record Collector). The release was also accompanied by a few interviews (e.g. Mojo).\nIn June 2013, a leak of ten previously unreleased songs on Soundcloud led to speculation that a new Prefab Sprout album was being recorded. A rumoured title was \"Trapdoor Melancholy.\" A proposed 7 October 2013 release date was subsequently confirmed on 14 July, with the official title given as Crimson/Red.\nCrimson/Red was indeed released on 7 October 2013. The album was made available on vinyl and CD on the Icebreaker records label. A limited edition box set featuring an interview CD was also released. 200 of these were available as signed copies. The album was a 100% Paddy McAloon effort, featuring no other members of Prefab Sprout. The lead single was \"The Best Jewel Thief in the World.\" A video for this track (produced by Tylar Cornak) was originally posted to Vimeo\n(wiki)",
