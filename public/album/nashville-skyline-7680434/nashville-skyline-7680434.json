      "biography": "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on 24  May 1941, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and artist. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for five decades. Zimmerman changed his surname to Dylan in homage to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who had frequented the streets and bars of New York's Greenwich Village a generation earlier. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\", became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" has been described as radically altering the parameters of popular music in 1965. His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.\n\nDylan's lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, and the music and performance styles of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Elvis Presley, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored numerous distinct traditions in American song-from folk, blues and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.\n\nDylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.",

      "editorial_notes": "“Truly he is what the land and country is all about,” Bob Dylan wrote in 2003, soon after Johnny Cash died, “the heart and soul of it personified and what it means to be here; and he said it all in plain English.” Dylan had been reared on country music, of course, and Cash was one of the brightest stars in that constellation. When Cash lashed out at the folk-music press for decrying Dylan’s new direction as the 1960s progressed, Dylan rejoiced, leading to their status as pen pals—and then real pals. When the two finally met, Dylan purportedly jumped up and down on a bed, exclaiming, “I met Johnny Cash.” Though they long talked of working together, their schedules interfered until they both happened to be working at Nashville’s Columbia outpost in early February 1969. After sharing dinner, Dylan and Cash cut 18 songs together in a late-night marathon.\n\nOne of those songs, a gentle duet of “Girl From the North Country”, leads 1969’s <i>Nashville Skyline</i>, Dylan’s brief-but-reverent entry into classic country. The singer had begun the decade with a famously nasal sneer, but he’d wound up quitting cigarettes, and his voice here is rich, nearly matching Cash’s stentorian baritone. What’s more, Dylan’s dense poetics from earlier in the decade had given way to something like simplicity, with the singer engaging in stick-with-me-baby entreaties during “Tell Me That It Isn’t True” and grandiose yearning during “I Threw It All Away”. Four years earlier, it would have been unfathomable to consider him singing something so blunt as “Love is all there is/It makes the world go ’round.” His sincerity and commitment on <i>Nashville Skyline</i>, though, are endearing.\n\nBy the the end of the 1960s, Dylan was one of music’s biggest stars, independent of genre. For his third album in Nashville, he plucked from the best of the best, with a line-up that includes Pete Drake on pedal steel, Charlie Daniels on bass and Norman Blake on guitar. Together, they ripple like lean muscle during the instrumental “Nashville Skyline Rag,” sit perfectly in the pocket during “Lay, Lady, Lay” and dance with a silly grin for “Country Pie”, a saucy number about the rural lifestyle and loving. “This man can rhyme the tick of time,” Cash wrote in the liner notes, again offering his imprimatur for his bold friend. “The edge of pain, the what of sane.”",
