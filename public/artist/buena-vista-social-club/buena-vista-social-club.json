  "biography": "The Buena Vista Social Club was a members club in Havana, Cuba that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 50 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.\nThe recording, named Buena Vista Social Club after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in Carnegie Hall, New York City for a documentary that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film, also called Buena Vista Social Club, was released to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards.\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, laúd player Barbarito Torres and trombonist and conductor Jesus \"Aguaje\" Ramos currently tour worldwide, to popular acclaim, with new members such as the singer Carlos Calunga, virtuoso pianist Rolando Luna and occasionally the solo singer Omara Portuondo, as part of a 13 member band called Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club.",

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for many years.\r\n\r\nMusicians:\r\nLuis Barzaga\r\nJoachim Cooder\r\nRy Cooder\r\nJulio Alberto Fernández\r\nIbrahim Ferrer\r\nCarlos González\r\nJuan de Marcos González\r\nRubén González\r\nSalvador Repilado Labrada\r\nManuel 'Puntillita' Licea\r\nOrlando 'Cachaito' López\r\nBenito Suárez Magana\r\nManuel 'Guajiro' Mirabal\r\nEliades Ochoa\r\nOmara Portuondo\r\nJulienne Oviedo Sánchez\r\nCompay Segundo\r\nBarbarito Torres\r\nAlberto 'Virgilio' Valdés\r\nLázaro Villa",

German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film for a documentary—also called Buena Vista Social Club—that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders\\' film was released in June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards. This was followed up by a second documentary Buena Vista Social Club: Adios in 2017.\\n\\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba\\'s \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died aged 95, 84, and 78 respectively; Compay Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\\n\\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as tresero Eliades Ochoa, veteran singer Omara Portuondo, trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, and laúd player Barbarito Torres currently tour worldwide.\\n\\nThe original Buenavista Social Club\\nThe Buenavista Social Club was a members-only club originally located in Buenavista (literally good view), a quarter in the current neighbourhood of Playa (before 1976 part of Marianao), one of the 15 municipalities in Cuba\\'s capital, Havana. The original club was founded in 1932 in a small wooden venue at calle Consulado y pasaje \"A\" (currently calle 29, n. 6007). In 1939, due to lack of space the club relocated to number 4610 on Avenue 31, between calles 46 and 48, in Almendares, Marianao. This location is recalled by Juan Cruz, former director of the Marianao Social Club and master of ceremonies at the Salón Rosado de la Tropical (other nightclubs in Havana). As seen in the Buena Vista Social Club documentary, when musicians Ry Cooder, Compay Segundo and a film crew attempted to identify the location of the club in the 1990s, local people could not agree on where it had stood.\\n\\nAt the time, clubs in Cuba were segregated; there were sociedades de blancos (white societies), sociedades de negros (black societies), etc. The Buenavista Social Club operated as a black society, which was rooted in a cabildo. Cabildos were fraternities organized during the 19th century by African slaves. The existence of many other black societies such as Marianao Social Club, Unión Fraternal, Club Atenas (whose members included doctors and engineers), and Buenavista Social Club, exemplified the remnants of institutionalized racial discrimination against Afro-Cubans. These societies operated as recreational centers where workers went to drink, play games, dance and listen to music. \\n\\nIn the words of Ry Cooder:\\n\"Society in Cuba and in the Caribbean including New Orleans, as far as I know, was organized around these fraternal social clubs. There were clubs of cigar wrappers, clubs for baseball players and they\\'d play sports and cards—whatever it is they did in their club—and they had mascots, like dogs. At the Buena Vista Social Club, musicians went there to hang out with each other, like they used to do at musicians\\' unions in the U.S., and they\\'d have dances and activities.\"\\n\\nAs a music venue, the Buenavista Social Club experienced the peak of Havana\\'s nightclub life, when charangas and conjuntos played several sets every night, going from club to club over the course of a week. Often, bands would dedicate songs to the clubs where they played. In the case of the Buenavista Social Club, an eponymous danzón was composed by Israel López \"Cachao\" in 1938, and performed with Arcaño y sus Maravillas. In addition, Arsenio Rodríguez dedicated \"Buenavista en guaguancó\" to the same place. Together with Orquesta Melodías del 40, the Maravillas and Arsenio\\'s conjunto were known as Los Tres Grandes (The Big Three), drawing the largest audiences wherever they played. These vibrant times in Havana were described by pianist Rubén González, who played in Arsenio\\'s conjunto, as \"an era of real musical life in Cuba, when there was very little money to earn, but everyone played because they really wanted to\".\\n\\nAfter the Revolution\\nShortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleó, a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana\\'s hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left in an effort to build a \"classless and colourblind society\", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers\\' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common.\\n\\nCuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as National Geographic notes:\\n\"Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba\\'s dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances...\"\\n\\nThe occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.\\n\\nAlbum\\nIn 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which African musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. On Cooder\\'s arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it transpired that the musicians from Mali had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.\\n\\nAlready on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist Orlando \"Cachaíto\" López, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos González, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea, pianist Rubén González and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.\\n\\nWithin three days of the project\\'s birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana\\'s EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s. Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that \"musicians understand each other through means other than speaking\".\\n\\nThe album was recorded in just six days and contained fourteen tracks; opening with \"Chan Chan\" written by Compay Segundo, a four chord son that was to become what Cooder described as \"the Buena Vista\\'s calling card\"; and ending with a rendition of \"La Bayamesa\", a romantic criolla composed by Sindo Garay (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name). The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release, Introducing...Rubén González, which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist.\\n\\nOne of the songs that featured on the album was \"Buena Vista Social Club\", a danzón written by Orestes López, the father of bass player \"Cachaíto\". The song spotlighted the piano work of Rubén González and it was recorded after Cooder heard González improvising around the tune\\'s musical theme before a day\\'s recording session. After playing the piece, González explained to Cooder the history of the social club and that the song was the club\\'s \"mascot tune\". When searching for a name for the overall project, manager Nick Gold chose the song\\'s title. \\n\\nAccording to Cooder:\\n\"It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon. It felt like a club, so let\\'s call it that. That\\'s what gave it a handle.\"\\n\\nUpon release on 17 September 1997, the CD became a huge \"word of mouth hit\", far beyond that of most world music releases. It sold more than one million copies and won a Grammy award in 1998. In 2003 it was listed by the New York-based Rolling Stone magazine as #260 in The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\\n\\nMusicians\\nA total of twenty musicians contributed to the recording including Ry Cooder\\'s son Joachim Cooder, who at the time was a 19-year-old scholar of Latin percussion and provided drums for the band. Ry Cooder himself played slide guitar on several songs and helped produce and mix the album, afterwards describing the sessions as \"the greatest musical experience of my life\". Ry Cooder had been a successful American guitarist since the 1960s, recording with Captain Beefheart and the Rolling Stones. Known for his slide guitar work, his interest in roots music led him to record music from diverse genres including Tex-Mex, Hawaiian and Tuvan throat singing. He was later prosecuted and fined $25,000 by U.S. authorities for his work on the Buena Vista Social Club, having broken the Trading with the Enemy Act, a clause that forms part of the ongoing United States embargo.\\n\\nMany of the Cuban musicians who featured on the album were at their musical prime in the 1940s and 1950s. After the success of the 1997 record they became known in Cuba as \"Los Superabuelos\" (the Super-Grandfathers). Juan de Marcos González, a Cuban folk revivalist who was younger than the bulk of performers introduced Cooder to veteran singer Ibrahim Ferrer. Ferrer (1927–2005) had been lead vocalist for bandleader Pacho Alonso, and also sang for Beny Moré, Cuba\\'s most prominent performer in the 1940s, before his soft singing style fell out of fashion. Having found the semi-retired seventy-year-old Ferrer taking his daily stroll on the streets of Havana and shining shoes for extra money, González signed him up for the project. Cooder later described the discovery as something that happens \"perhaps once in your life\", and Ferrer as \"the Cuban Nat King Cole\". Ferrer became a prominent member of the group, and the success of the record was attributed in part to the popularity of his vocal performances. The singer went on to record a number of successful solo albums and performed with contemporary acts such as the Gorillaz before his death in 2005 at the age of 78.\\n\\nVirtuoso pianist Rubén González (1919–2003) also had further success releasing two solo albums after working on the initial project. González was a pianist for bandleader Arsenio Rodríguez in the 1940s, and is attributed with helping establish Cuban piano styles that were to dominate Latin music for the remainder of the century. Despite suffering from arthritis and not even owning a piano at the time of recording with Cooder, (due to an infestation of termites whilst living in South America) the American guitarist described him as \"the greatest piano soloist I have ever heard\". After the success of the 1997 record, González recorded and toured with bassist Orlando \"Cachaíto\" López, who was the only musician to play on all of the songs on the Buena Vista Social Club album. \"Cachaito\" (1933–2009) was the son of multi-instrumentalist Orestes López and the nephew of fellow bassist Israel \"Cachao\" López, the brothers often attributed with inventing the mambo. Named after his prestigious uncle, \"Cachaito\" (little Cachao) was a leading Descarga musician in the 1950s and 1960s, a musical form that takes its influence from modern jazz, and he became the ever-present bassist at Buena Vista Social Club performances and recordings.\\n\\nOne of the first to come on board the project was Compay Segundo (born Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz) (1907–2003), who at 89 years old was the oldest of the performers. During a discussion about politics, the veteran Segundo said: \"Politics? This new guy (Fidel Castro) is good. The 1930s were rough. That\\'s when we had the really bad times.\" Segundo was an accomplished guitarist and tres player who started his career playing with established bands of the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1940s, he gained fame as one half of the Los Compadres duo, and then formed Los Muchachos, a band that he led until his death in 2003. For the Buena Vista Social Club recording and performances, Segundo played a unique seven-stringed instrument, a hybrid between a guitar and a tres, which he devised himself and called an armónico. He also sang, mostly doing background vocals, in a number of songs in his baritone voice, including the self-penned opening track, Chan Chan, with Eliades Ochoa as the leading voice. Cowboy hat wearing Eliades Ochoa (b. 1946), who had collaborated previously with Segundo and was a well established traditional Cuban folk performer, played guitar and sang for the group. Omara Portuondo (b. 1930), a bolero singer and the only female in the collective, sang \"Veinte Años\" on the record and duets with Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer during live performances.\\n\\nOther performers included singer Pío Leyva (1917–2006) who had been working with Segundo since the early 1950s, and fellow and singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea (1927–2000), who had performed with Celia Cruz and Benny Moré. Additional improvised percussion was provided by Amadito Valdés and Carlos González. The youngest established member of the group was Barbarito Torres, (b. 1956) a virtuoso player of the laúd, a Cuban offshoot of the lute. Trumpet was provided by Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, (1933-2024) who went on to release solo records under the Buena Vista presents... title.\\n\\nFilm\\nShortly after returning from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders\\' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it was an effort to force Cooder to focus on the project, \"He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, and I knew he was back in Havana.\" Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer\\'s first solo album, in 1998.\\n\\nWenders filmed the recording sessions on the recently enhanced format Digital Video with the help of cinematographer Robert Müller, and then shot interviews with each \"Buena Vista\" ensemble member in different Havana locations. Wenders was also present to film the group\\'s first performance with a full line-up in Amsterdam in April 1998 (two nights) and a second time in Carnegie Hall, New York City on 1 July 1998. The completed documentary was released on 17 September 1999, and included scenes in New York of the Cubans, some of whom had never left the island, window shopping and visiting tourist sites. According to Sight & Sound magazine, these scenes of \"innocents abroad\" were the film\\'s most moving moments, as the contrasts between societies of Havana and New York become evident on the faces of the performers. Ferrer, from an impoverished background and staunchly anti consumerist, was shown describing the city as \"beautiful\" and finding the experience overwhelming. Upon completion of filming, Wenders felt that the film \"didn\\'t feel really like it was a documentary anymore. It felt like it was a true character piece\".\\n\\nThe film became a box office success, grossing $23,002,182 worldwide. Critics were generally enthusiastic about the story and especially the music, although leading U.S. film critic Roger Ebert and the British Film Institute\\'s Peter Curran felt that Wenders had lingered too long on Cooder during the performances; and the editing, which interspersed interviews with music, had disrupted the continuity of the songs. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature in 1999. It won best documentary at the European Film Awards and received seventeen other major accolades internationally.\\n\\nLive performances\\nThe first performances by the full line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and television appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Rubén González performed together in Los Angeles in 1998 to an audience that included Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez, Ferrer dedicating the song Mami Me Gusto to the Hispanic Lopez.\\n\\nPerformances in Florida, which has a large Cuban exile and Cuban American community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate. In the late 1990s, a concert by Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba turned into a near riot when concert goers were attacked and spat at by protesters opposed to the Cuban government. When \"Buena Vista\" musicians played for a music industry conference at Miami Beach in 1998, hundreds of protesters chanted outside and the convention center hall was cleared briefly because of a bomb threat. In 1999, Ferrer and Ruben González were forced to cancel Miami shows citing fears for their safety after fellow-Cubans Los Van Van drew 4,000 protesters at a previous show, and Compay Segundo was forced to cut short a 1999 Miami performance due to another bomb threat. When touring the U.S., the Cubans are only entitled to their per diem (transportation and lodging) and are not permitted performance fees due to the U.S. embargo. In 2001 a Buena Vista Social Club (with Ibrahim Ferrer) performance was recorded in Austin for PBS and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002.\\n\\nMusicians associated with Buena Vista Social Club have toured throughout the world as Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club, and despite the deaths of six of the original members, the collective performed with many of the remaining ensemble members including Barbarito Torres and \"Guajiro\" Mirabal. Ry Cooder\\'s guitar parts were handled by Manuel Galbán, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer\\'s first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders\\' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as \"something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they\\'ve never really had one defining front person\", adding, \"It\\'s hard to know what to expect from what is more of a brand than a band.\"\\n\\nCultural impact\\nThe international success of the Buena Vista Social Club generated a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music as a whole. Musical director Juan de Marcos felt that the recordings serve \"as a symbol of the power of Cuban music, and which to a certain degree have contributed to Cuban music regaining the status it always had in Latin American and world music.\"\\n\\nCuba\\'s burgeoning tourist industry of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, \"In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It\\'s as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner.\" The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite the appeal of the \"Buena Vista\" ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the \"Buena Vista Social Club\" than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.\\n\\nMari Marques, a Cuban American who leads cultural tours to Cuba, contests that the preponderance of traditional musicians was not solely a consequence of the \"Buena Vista Social Club\". Marques believes the notion that some music had been completely neglected in Cuba is \"a romantic exaggeration that was propagated by U.S. media coverage\", and the reality is that son trios have existed \"everywhere in cities such as Santiago de Cuba in the east of the island.\" British world music record label Tumi Music, who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians, all as good as, and some as old as the \"Buena Vista\" participants, \"but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world.\" The label lamented that, \"for the West to pay any real attention and consume the product, you needed someone like Ry Cooder to give it a stamp of approval first.\"\\n\\nBritish Socialist Workers Party member and Marxist writer Mike Gonzalez believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to \"timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music\". Gonzalez asserts that the aura evoked did not represent \"the real Cuba\" before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to \"enjoy the fruits of this confusion\". The American Historical Review suggested that the Buena Vista Social Club\\'s mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s–30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959—which \"no longer seems so bad\".\\n\\nA stage musical adaptation with the same name as the album and focusing on the history and performers of the group was staged Off-Broadway in 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Buena+Vista+Social+Club\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the members\\' club of the same name in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, some of whom had been retired for many years.\\n\\nThe group\\'s eponymous studio album was recorded in March 1996 and released in September 1997, quickly becoming an international success, which prompted the ensemble to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam and New York in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film for a documentary—also called Buena Vista Social Club—that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders\\' film was released in June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards. This was followed up by a second documentary Buena Vista Social Club: Adios in 2017.\\n\\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba\\'s \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died aged 95, 84, and 78 respectively; Compay Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\\n\\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as tresero Eliades Ochoa, veteran singer Omara Portuondo, trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, and laúd player Barbarito Torres currently tour worldwide.\\n\\nThe original Buenavista Social Club\\nThe Buenavista Social Club was a members-only club originally located in Buenavista (literally good view), a quarter in the current neighbourhood of Playa (before 1976 part of Marianao), one of the 15 municipalities in Cuba\\'s capital, Havana. The original club was founded in 1932 in a small wooden venue at calle Consulado y pasaje \"A\" (currently calle 29, n. 6007). In 1939, due to lack of space the club relocated to number 4610 on Avenue 31, between calles 46 and 48, in Almendares, Marianao. This location is recalled by Juan Cruz, former director of the Marianao Social Club and master of ceremonies at the Salón Rosado de la Tropical (other nightclubs in Havana). As seen in the Buena Vista Social Club documentary, when musicians Ry Cooder, Compay Segundo and a film crew attempted to identify the location of the club in the 1990s, local people could not agree on where it had stood.\\n\\nAt the time, clubs in Cuba were segregated; there were sociedades de blancos (white societies), sociedades de negros (black societies), etc. The Buenavista Social Club operated as a black society, which was rooted in a cabildo. Cabildos were fraternities organized during the 19th century by African slaves. The existence of many other black societies such as Marianao Social Club, Unión Fraternal, Club Atenas (whose members included doctors and engineers), and Buenavista Social Club, exemplified the remnants of institutionalized racial discrimination against Afro-Cubans. These societies operated as recreational centers where workers went to drink, play games, dance and listen to music. \\n\\nIn the words of Ry Cooder:\\n\"Society in Cuba and in the Caribbean including New Orleans, as far as I know, was organized around these fraternal social clubs. There were clubs of cigar wrappers, clubs for baseball players and they\\'d play sports and cards—whatever it is they did in their club—and they had mascots, like dogs. At the Buena Vista Social Club, musicians went there to hang out with each other, like they used to do at musicians\\' unions in the U.S., and they\\'d have dances and activities.\"\\n\\nAs a music venue, the Buenavista Social Club experienced the peak of Havana\\'s nightclub life, when charangas and conjuntos played several sets every night, going from club to club over the course of a week. Often, bands would dedicate songs to the clubs where they played. In the case of the Buenavista Social Club, an eponymous danzón was composed by Israel López \"Cachao\" in 1938, and performed with Arcaño y sus Maravillas. In addition, Arsenio Rodríguez dedicated \"Buenavista en guaguancó\" to the same place. Together with Orquesta Melodías del 40, the Maravillas and Arsenio\\'s conjunto were known as Los Tres Grandes (The Big Three), drawing the largest audiences wherever they played. These vibrant times in Havana were described by pianist Rubén González, who played in Arsenio\\'s conjunto, as \"an era of real musical life in Cuba, when there was very little money to earn, but everyone played because they really wanted to\".\\n\\nAfter the Revolution\\nShortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleó, a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana\\'s hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left in an effort to build a \"classless and colourblind society\", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers\\' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common.\\n\\nCuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as National Geographic notes:\\n\"Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba\\'s dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances...\"\\n\\nThe occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.\\n\\nAlbum\\nIn 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which African musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. On Cooder\\'s arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it transpired that the musicians from Mali had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.\\n\\nAlready on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist Orlando \"Cachaíto\" López, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos González, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea, pianist Rubén González and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.\\n\\nWithin three days of the project\\'s birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana\\'s EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s. Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that \"musicians understand each other through means other than speaking\".\\n\\nThe album was recorded in just six days and contained fourteen tracks; opening with \"Chan Chan\" written by Compay Segundo, a four chord son that was to become what Cooder described as \"the Buena Vista\\'s calling card\"; and ending with a rendition of \"La Bayamesa\", a romantic criolla composed by Sindo Garay (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name). The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release, Introducing...Rubén González, which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist.\\n\\nOne of the songs that featured on the album was \"Buena Vista Social Club\", a danzón written by Orestes López, the father of bass player \"Cachaíto\". The song spotlighted the piano work of Rubén González and it was recorded after Cooder heard González improvising around the tune\\'s musical theme before a day\\'s recording session. After playing the piece, González explained to Cooder the history of the social club and that the song was the club\\'s \"mascot tune\". When searching for a name for the overall project, manager Nick Gold chose the song\\'s title. \\n\\nAccording to Cooder:\\n\"It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon. It felt like a club, so let\\'s call it that. That\\'s what gave it a handle.\"\\n\\nUpon release on 17 September 1997, the CD became a huge \"word of mouth hit\", far beyond that of most world music releases. It sold more than one million copies and won a Grammy award in 1998. In 2003 it was listed by the New York-based Rolling Stone magazine as #260 in The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\\n\\nMusicians\\nA total of twenty musicians contributed to the recording including Ry Cooder\\'s son Joachim Cooder, who at the time was a 19-year-old scholar of Latin percussion and provided drums for the band. Ry Cooder himself played slide guitar on several songs and helped produce and mix the album, afterwards describing the sessions as \"the greatest musical experience of my life\". Ry Cooder had been a successful American guitarist since the 1960s, recording with Captain Beefheart and the Rolling Stones. Known for his slide guitar work, his interest in roots music led him to record music from diverse genres including Tex-Mex, Hawaiian and Tuvan throat singing. He was later prosecuted and fined $25,000 by U.S. authorities for his work on the Buena Vista Social Club, having broken the Trading with the Enemy Act, a clause that forms part of the ongoing United States embargo.\\n\\nMany of the Cuban musicians who featured on the album were at their musical prime in the 1940s and 1950s. After the success of the 1997 record they became known in Cuba as \"Los Superabuelos\" (the Super-Grandfathers). Juan de Marcos González, a Cuban folk revivalist who was younger than the bulk of performers introduced Cooder to veteran singer Ibrahim Ferrer. Ferrer (1927–2005) had been lead vocalist for bandleader Pacho Alonso, and also sang for Beny Moré, Cuba\\'s most prominent performer in the 1940s, before his soft singing style fell out of fashion. Having found the semi-retired seventy-year-old Ferrer taking his daily stroll on the streets of Havana and shining shoes for extra money, González signed him up for the project. Cooder later described the discovery as something that happens \"perhaps once in your life\", and Ferrer as \"the Cuban Nat King Cole\". Ferrer became a prominent member of the group, and the success of the record was attributed in part to the popularity of his vocal performances. The singer went on to record a number of successful solo albums and performed with contemporary acts such as the Gorillaz before his death in 2005 at the age of 78.\\n\\nVirtuoso pianist Rubén González (1919–2003) also had further success releasing two solo albums after working on the initial project. González was a pianist for bandleader Arsenio Rodríguez in the 1940s, and is attributed with helping establish Cuban piano styles that were to dominate Latin music for the remainder of the century. Despite suffering from arthritis and not even owning a piano at the time of recording with Cooder, (due to an infestation of termites whilst living in South America) the American guitarist described him as \"the greatest piano soloist I have ever heard\". After the success of the 1997 record, González recorded and toured with bassist Orlando \"Cachaíto\" López, who was the only musician to play on all of the songs on the Buena Vista Social Club album. \"Cachaito\" (1933–2009) was the son of multi-instrumentalist Orestes López and the nephew of fellow bassist Israel \"Cachao\" López, the brothers often attributed with inventing the mambo. Named after his prestigious uncle, \"Cachaito\" (little Cachao) was a leading Descarga musician in the 1950s and 1960s, a musical form that takes its influence from modern jazz, and he became the ever-present bassist at Buena Vista Social Club performances and recordings.\\n\\nOne of the first to come on board the project was Compay Segundo (born Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz) (1907–2003), who at 89 years old was the oldest of the performers. During a discussion about politics, the veteran Segundo said: \"Politics? This new guy (Fidel Castro) is good. The 1930s were rough. That\\'s when we had the really bad times.\" Segundo was an accomplished guitarist and tres player who started his career playing with established bands of the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1940s, he gained fame as one half of the Los Compadres duo, and then formed Los Muchachos, a band that he led until his death in 2003. For the Buena Vista Social Club recording and performances, Segundo played a unique seven-stringed instrument, a hybrid between a guitar and a tres, which he devised himself and called an armónico. He also sang, mostly doing background vocals, in a number of songs in his baritone voice, including the self-penned opening track, Chan Chan, with Eliades Ochoa as the leading voice. Cowboy hat wearing Eliades Ochoa (b. 1946), who had collaborated previously with Segundo and was a well established traditional Cuban folk performer, played guitar and sang for the group. Omara Portuondo (b. 1930), a bolero singer and the only female in the collective, sang \"Veinte Años\" on the record and duets with Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer during live performances.\\n\\nOther performers included singer Pío Leyva (1917–2006) who had been working with Segundo since the early 1950s, and fellow and singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea (1927–2000), who had performed with Celia Cruz and Benny Moré. Additional improvised percussion was provided by Amadito Valdés and Carlos González. The youngest established member of the group was Barbarito Torres, (b. 1956) a virtuoso player of the laúd, a Cuban offshoot of the lute. Trumpet was provided by Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, (1933-2024) who went on to release solo records under the Buena Vista presents... title.\\n\\nFilm\\nShortly after returning from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders\\' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it was an effort to force Cooder to focus on the project, \"He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, and I knew he was back in Havana.\" Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer\\'s first solo album, in 1998.\\n\\nWenders filmed the recording sessions on the recently enhanced format Digital Video with the help of cinematographer Robert Müller, and then shot interviews with each \"Buena Vista\" ensemble member in different Havana locations. Wenders was also present to film the group\\'s first performance with a full line-up in Amsterdam in April 1998 (two nights) and a second time in Carnegie Hall, New York City on 1 July 1998. The completed documentary was released on 17 September 1999, and included scenes in New York of the Cubans, some of whom had never left the island, window shopping and visiting tourist sites. According to Sight & Sound magazine, these scenes of \"innocents abroad\" were the film\\'s most moving moments, as the contrasts between societies of Havana and New York become evident on the faces of the performers. Ferrer, from an impoverished background and staunchly anti consumerist, was shown describing the city as \"beautiful\" and finding the experience overwhelming. Upon completion of filming, Wenders felt that the film \"didn\\'t feel really like it was a documentary anymore. It felt like it was a true character piece\".\\n\\nThe film became a box office success, grossing $23,002,182 worldwide. Critics were generally enthusiastic about the story and especially the music, although leading U.S. film critic Roger Ebert and the British Film Institute\\'s Peter Curran felt that Wenders had lingered too long on Cooder during the performances; and the editing, which interspersed interviews with music, had disrupted the continuity of the songs. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature in 1999. It won best documentary at the European Film Awards and received seventeen other major accolades internationally.\\n\\nLive performances\\nThe first performances by the full line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and television appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Rubén González performed together in Los Angeles in 1998 to an audience that included Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez, Ferrer dedicating the song Mami Me Gusto to the Hispanic Lopez.\\n\\nPerformances in Florida, which has a large Cuban exile and Cuban American community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate. In the late 1990s, a concert by Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba turned into a near riot when concert goers were attacked and spat at by protesters opposed to the Cuban government. When \"Buena Vista\" musicians played for a music industry conference at Miami Beach in 1998, hundreds of protesters chanted outside and the convention center hall was cleared briefly because of a bomb threat. In 1999, Ferrer and Ruben González were forced to cancel Miami shows citing fears for their safety after fellow-Cubans Los Van Van drew 4,000 protesters at a previous show, and Compay Segundo was forced to cut short a 1999 Miami performance due to another bomb threat. When touring the U.S., the Cubans are only entitled to their per diem (transportation and lodging) and are not permitted performance fees due to the U.S. embargo. In 2001 a Buena Vista Social Club (with Ibrahim Ferrer) performance was recorded in Austin for PBS and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002.\\n\\nMusicians associated with Buena Vista Social Club have toured throughout the world as Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club, and despite the deaths of six of the original members, the collective performed with many of the remaining ensemble members including Barbarito Torres and \"Guajiro\" Mirabal. Ry Cooder\\'s guitar parts were handled by Manuel Galbán, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer\\'s first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders\\' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as \"something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they\\'ve never really had one defining front person\", adding, \"It\\'s hard to know what to expect from what is more of a brand than a band.\"\\n\\nCultural impact\\nThe international success of the Buena Vista Social Club generated a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music as a whole. Musical director Juan de Marcos felt that the recordings serve \"as a symbol of the power of Cuban music, and which to a certain degree have contributed to Cuban music regaining the status it always had in Latin American and world music.\"\\n\\nCuba\\'s burgeoning tourist industry of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, \"In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It\\'s as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner.\" The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite the appeal of the \"Buena Vista\" ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the \"Buena Vista Social Club\" than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.\\n\\nMari Marques, a Cuban American who leads cultural tours to Cuba, contests that the preponderance of traditional musicians was not solely a consequence of the \"Buena Vista Social Club\". Marques believes the notion that some music had been completely neglected in Cuba is \"a romantic exaggeration that was propagated by U.S. media coverage\", and the reality is that son trios have existed \"everywhere in cities such as Santiago de Cuba in the east of the island.\" British world music record label Tumi Music, who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians, all as good as, and some as old as the \"Buena Vista\" participants, \"but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world.\" The label lamented that, \"for the West to pay any real attention and consume the product, you needed someone like Ry Cooder to give it a stamp of approval first.\"\\n\\nBritish Socialist Workers Party member and Marxist writer Mike Gonzalez believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to \"timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music\". Gonzalez asserts that the aura evoked did not represent \"the real Cuba\" before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to \"enjoy the fruits of this confusion\". The American Historical Review suggested that the Buena Vista Social Club\\'s mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s–30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959—which \"no longer seems so bad\".\\n\\nA stage musical adaptation with the same name as the album and focusing on the history and performers of the group was staged Off-Broadway in 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Buena+Vista+Social+Club\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "The Buena Vista Social Club was a members club in Havana, Cuba that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 50 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.\nThe recording, named Buena Vista Social Club after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in Carnegie Hall, New York City for a documentary that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film, also called Buena Vista Social Club, was released to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards.\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, laúd player Barbarito Torres and trombonist and conductor Jesus \"Aguaje\" Ramos currently tour worldwide, to popular acclaim, with new members such as the singer Carlos Calunga, virtuoso pianist Rolando Luna and occasionally the solo singer Omara Portuondo, as part of a 13 member band called Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club.",
      "biography_es": "Buena Vista Social Club fue un club social de La Habana, Cuba, donde sus miembros practicaban actividades relacionadas con el baile y la música. Se convirtió en un sitio muy popular, donde se encontraban e interpretaban música quienes formaban parte de él.\n\nEn los años 1990, casi 50 años después de que el club se cerrase, inspiró una grabación hecha por el músico cubano Juan de Marcos González y el guitarrista estadounidense Ry Cooder con músicos cubanos tradicionales, muchos de ellos antiguos miembros del club en el que se presentaron cuando su popularidad estaba en la cumbre. La grabación, llamada Buena Vista Social Club, por esa institución de La Habana, fue un éxito internacional y el grupo se presentó con su formación completa en Ámsterdam en 1998. El director de cine alemán Wim Wenders grabó la presentación, seguida de un segundo concierto en el Carnegie Hall, de Nueva York, concierto éste que fue la cumbre del documental que resultó del trabajo de Wenders. El documental también incluye entrevistas con los músicos llevadas a cabo en La Habana. La película de Wenders, también nombrada Buena Vista Social Club, fue aclamada por los críticos y recibió una nominación al Óscar al mejor documental largo y numerosos galardones, entre los que se incluye Mejor Documental en el European Film Awards.\n\nTanto el éxito del álbum como el de la película produjeron un gran interés por la música cubana tradicional y la música latinoamericana en general, en todo el mundo. Algunos de los músicos cubanos lanzaron después álbumes en solitario que fueron bien acogidos, y grabaron otros en colaboración con diversas estrellas de la música internacional de distintos géneros. El nombre \"Buena Vista Social Club\" se convirtió en un término que abarcaba este tipo de presentaciones y lanzamientos en colaboración, además de relacionarse con una etiqueta que encapsula la \"Edad de Oro de la música Cubana\", entre los 1930 y los 1950. El nuevo éxito fue efímero para la mayoría de los miembros del grupo: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, Ibrahim Ferrer y Pío Leyva, ya que murieron pocos años después, a los 95, 84, 78 y 89 años respectivamente; Segundo y González en 2003, Ferrer en 2005 y Leyva en 2006. Se mantienen vigentes otros de los miembros principales como:Omara Portuondo, Eliades Ochoa, el trompetista Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, el percusionista Amadito Valdés, el laudista Barbarito Torres, el guitarrista Ry Cooder, su hijo el percusionista Joachim Cooder, el productor Juan de Marcos Gónzalez, Ibrahim Ferrer Jr. y Salvador Repilado (hijo de Compay Segundo).",
      "biography_fr": "Le Buena Vista Social Club était une mythique boîte de nuit dans la banlieue de La Havane à Cuba (situé « Calle 41 » entre les numéros 46 et 48, dans le quartier Marianao). Après la révolution cubaine de 1959, cette boîte de nuit disparu.\nCinquante ans après sa fermeture, son nom fut repris pour un projet musical, imaginé par Nick Gold de la maison de disques World Circuit et le guitariste américain Ry Cooder. L'idée de ce projet était de réunir dans un même enregistrement des musiciens cubains « campesinos » (soneros légendaires des années 1930, 40 et 50), et des musiciens d'Afrique de l'Ouest. Retenus à l'aéroport de Paris, les Africains ne purent se rendre à Cuba, et finalement l'enregistrement de l'album s'effectua sans eux.\nL'album (intitulé Buena Vista Social Club) rencontra un tel succès que le groupe fut incité à se produire sur scène à Amsterdam en 1998, suivi de plusieurs concerts au Carnegie Hall de New York.\nLe cinéaste Wim Wenders fut sollicité pour les filmer. Il en fit un documentaire, en ajoutant les interviews, effectués à La Havane, des différents musiciens. Le film fut lui aussi intitulé Buena Vista Social Club.",

      "biography_nl": "Buena Vista Social Club is een groep Cubaanse muzikanten. De groep is vernoemd naar een club met dezelfde naam die tot in de jaren veertig bestond in de Cubaanse hoofdstad Havana. Deze club was destijds een trefpunt voor muzikaal Havana. In 1996 werd de band opgericht onder leiding van de Amerikaans gitarist en producer Ry Cooder en de Cubaan Juan de Marcos González. Het bijzondere van deze band is dat alle leden mannen op leeftijd zijn. Een aantal van hen had destijds al in de betreffende club gespeeld en pakten hun muziekcarrière weer op. De allereerste opname was zo'n succes dat ze wereldberoemd werden, wat leidde tot optredens in onder meer Theater Carré in Amsterdam en Carnegie Hall in New York. Hun meest bekende nummer is Chan Chan uit 1997.\n\nWim Wenders heeft in 1999 een documentaire over de band gemaakt met als naam Buena Vista Social Club. Deze film werd genomineerd voor een Academy Award voor Beste Documentaire.\n\nEen aantal leden is inmiddels overleden en vervangen door jongere muzikanten.

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for many years.\r\n\r\nMusicians:\r\nLuis Barzaga\r\nJoachim Cooder\r\nRy Cooder\r\nJulio Alberto Fernández\r\nIbrahim Ferrer\r\nCarlos González\r\nJuan de Marcos González\r\nRubén González\r\nSalvador Repilado Labrada\r\nManuel 'Puntillita' Licea\r\nOrlando 'Cachaito' López\r\nBenito Suárez Magana\r\nManuel 'Guajiro' Mirabal\r\nEliades Ochoa\r\nOmara Portuondo\r\nJulienne Oviedo Sánchez\r\nCompay Segundo\r\nBarbarito Torres\r\nAlberto 'Virgilio' Valdés\r\nLázaro Villa",

      "bio_content": "Buena Vista Social Club was a musical ensemble primarily made up of Cuban musicians, formed in 1996. The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the members' club of the same name in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, some of whom had been retired for many years.\n\nThe group's eponymous studio album was recorded in March 1996 and released in September 1997, quickly becoming an international success, which prompted the ensemble to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam and New York in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film for a documentary—also called Buena Vista Social Club—that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film was released in June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards. This was followed up by a second documentary Buena Vista Social Club: Adios in 2017.\n\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died aged 95, 84, and 78 respectively; Compay Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\n\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as tresero Eliades Ochoa, veteran singer Omara Portuondo, trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, and laúd player Barbarito Torres currently tour worldwide.\n\nThe original Buenavista Social Club\nThe Buenavista Social Club was a members-only club originally located in Buenavista (literally good view), a quarter in the current neighbourhood of Playa (before 1976 part of Marianao), one of the 15 municipalities in Cuba's capital, Havana. The original club was founded in 1932 in a small wooden venue at calle Consulado y pasaje \"A\" (currently calle 29, n. 6007). In 1939, due to lack of space the club relocated to number 4610 on Avenue 31, between calles 46 and 48, in Almendares, Marianao. This location is recalled by Juan Cruz, former director of the Marianao Social Club and master of ceremonies at the Salón Rosado de la Tropical (other nightclubs in Havana). As seen in the Buena Vista Social Club documentary, when musicians Ry Cooder, Compay Segundo and a film crew attempted to identify the location of the club in the 1990s, local people could not agree on where it had stood.\n\nAt the time, clubs in Cuba were segregated; there were sociedades de blancos (white societies), sociedades de negros (black societies), etc. The Buenavista Social Club operated as a black society, which was rooted in a cabildo. Cabildos were fraternities organized during the 19th century by African slaves. The existence of many other black societies such as Marianao Social Club, Unión Fraternal, Club Atenas (whose members included doctors and engineers), and Buenavista Social Club, exemplified the remnants of institutionalized racial discrimination against Afro-Cubans. These societies operated as recreational centers where workers went to drink, play games, dance and listen to music. \n\nIn the words of Ry Cooder:\n\"Society in Cuba and in the Caribbean including New Orleans, as far as I know, was organized around these fraternal social clubs. There were clubs of cigar wrappers, clubs for baseball players and they'd play sports and cards—whatever it is they did in their club—and they had mascots, like dogs. At the Buena Vista Social Club, musicians went there to hang out with each other, like they used to do at musicians' unions in the U.S., and they'd have dances and activities.\"\n\nAs a music venue, the Buenavista Social Club experienced the peak of Havana's nightclub life, when charangas and conjuntos played several sets every night, going from club to club over the course of a week. Often, bands would dedicate songs to the clubs where they played. In the case of the Buenavista Social Club, an eponymous danzón was composed by Israel López \"Cachao\" in 1938, and performed with Arcaño y sus Maravillas. In addition, Arsenio Rodríguez dedicated \"Buenavista en guaguancó\" to the same place. Together with Orquesta Melodías del 40, the Maravillas and Arsenio's conjunto were known as Los Tres Grandes (The Big Three), drawing the largest audiences wherever they played. These vibrant times in Havana were described by pianist Rubén González, who played in Arsenio's conjunto, as \"an era of real musical life in Cuba, when there was very little money to earn, but everyone played because they really wanted to\".\n\nAfter the Revolution\nShortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleó, a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana's hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left in an effort to build a \"classless and colourblind society\", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common.\n\nCuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as National Geographic notes:\n\"Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba's dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances...\"\n\nThe occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.\n\nAlbum\nIn 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which African musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it transpired that the musicians from Mali had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.\n\nAlready on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist Orlando \"Cachaíto\" López, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos González, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea, pianist Rubén González and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.\n\nWithin three days of the project's birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana's EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s. Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that \"musicians understand each other through means other than speaking\".\n\nThe album was recorded in just six days and contained fourteen tracks; opening with \"Chan Chan\" written by Compay Segundo, a four chord son that was to become what Cooder described as \"the Buena Vista's calling card\"; and ending with a rendition of \"La Bayamesa\", a romantic criolla composed by Sindo Garay (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name). The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release, Introducing...Rubén González, which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist.\n\nOne of the songs that featured on the album was \"Buena Vista Social Club\", a danzón written by Orestes López, the father of bass player \"Cachaíto\". The song spotlighted the piano work of Rubén González and it was recorded after Cooder heard González improvising around the tune's musical theme before a day's recording session. After playing the piece, González explained to Cooder the history of the social club and that the song was the club's \"mascot tune\". When searching for a name for the overall project, manager Nick Gold chose the song's title. \n\nAccording to Cooder:\n\"It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon. It felt like a club, so let's call it that. That's what gave it a handle.\"\n\nUpon release on 17 September 1997, the CD became a huge \"word of mouth hit\", far beyond that of most world music releases. It sold more than one million copies and won a Grammy award in 1998. In 2003 it was listed by the New York-based Rolling Stone magazine as #260 in The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nMusicians\nA total of twenty musicians contributed to the recording including Ry Cooder's son Joachim Cooder, who at the time was a 19-year-old scholar of Latin percussion and provided drums for the band. Ry Cooder himself played slide guitar on several songs and helped produce and mix the album, afterwards describing the sessions as \"the greatest musical experience of my life\". Ry Cooder had been a successful American guitarist since the 1960s, recording with Captain Beefheart and the Rolling Stones. Known for his slide guitar work, his interest in roots music led him to record music from diverse genres including Tex-Mex, Hawaiian and Tuvan throat singing. He was later prosecuted and fined $25,000 by U.S. authorities for his work on the Buena Vista Social Club, having broken the Trading with the Enemy Act, a clause that forms part of the ongoing United States embargo.\n\nMany of the Cuban musicians who featured on the album were at their musical prime in the 1940s and 1950s. After the success of the 1997 record they became known in Cuba as \"Los Superabuelos\" (the Super-Grandfathers). Juan de Marcos González, a Cuban folk revivalist who was younger than the bulk of performers introduced Cooder to veteran singer Ibrahim Ferrer. Ferrer (1927–2005) had been lead vocalist for bandleader Pacho Alonso, and also sang for Beny Moré, Cuba's most prominent performer in the 1940s, before his soft singing style fell out of fashion. Having found the semi-retired seventy-year-old Ferrer taking his daily stroll on the streets of Havana and shining shoes for extra money, González signed him up for the project. Cooder later described the discovery as something that happens \"perhaps once in your life\", and Ferrer as \"the Cuban Nat King Cole\". Ferrer became a prominent member of the group, and the success of the record was attributed in part to the popularity of his vocal performances. The singer went on to record a number of successful solo albums and performed with contemporary acts such as the Gorillaz before his death in 2005 at the age of 78.\n\nVirtuoso pianist Rubén González (1919–2003) also had further success releasing two solo albums after working on the initial project. González was a pianist for bandleader Arsenio Rodríguez in the 1940s, and is attributed with helping establish Cuban piano styles that were to dominate Latin music for the remainder of the century. Despite suffering from arthritis and not even owning a piano at the time of recording with Cooder, (due to an infestation of termites whilst living in South America) the American guitarist described him as \"the greatest piano soloist I have ever heard\". After the success of the 1997 record, González recorded and toured with bassist Orlando \"Cachaíto\" López, who was the only musician to play on all of the songs on the Buena Vista Social Club album. \"Cachaito\" (1933–2009) was the son of multi-instrumentalist Orestes López and the nephew of fellow bassist Israel \"Cachao\" López, the brothers often attributed with inventing the mambo. Named after his prestigious uncle, \"Cachaito\" (little Cachao) was a leading Descarga musician in the 1950s and 1960s, a musical form that takes its influence from modern jazz, and he became the ever-present bassist at Buena Vista Social Club performances and recordings.\n\nOne of the first to come on board the project was Compay Segundo (born Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz) (1907–2003), who at 89 years old was the oldest of the performers. During a discussion about politics, the veteran Segundo said: \"Politics? This new guy (Fidel Castro) is good. The 1930s were rough. That's when we had the really bad times.\" Segundo was an accomplished guitarist and tres player who started his career playing with established bands of the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1940s, he gained fame as one half of the Los Compadres duo, and then formed Los Muchachos, a band that he led until his death in 2003. For the Buena Vista Social Club recording and performances, Segundo played a unique seven-stringed instrument, a hybrid between a guitar and a tres, which he devised himself and called an armónico. He also sang, mostly doing background vocals, in a number of songs in his baritone voice, including the self-penned opening track, Chan Chan, with Eliades Ochoa as the leading voice. Cowboy hat wearing Eliades Ochoa (b. 1946), who had collaborated previously with Segundo and was a well established traditional Cuban folk performer, played guitar and sang for the group. Omara Portuondo (b. 1930), a bolero singer and the only female in the collective, sang \"Veinte Años\" on the record and duets with Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer during live performances.\n\nOther performers included singer Pío Leyva (1917–2006) who had been working with Segundo since the early 1950s, and fellow and singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea (1927–2000), who had performed with Celia Cruz and Benny Moré. Additional improvised percussion was provided by Amadito Valdés and Carlos González. The youngest established member of the group was Barbarito Torres, (b. 1956) a virtuoso player of the laúd, a Cuban offshoot of the lute. Trumpet was provided by Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, (1933-2024) who went on to release solo records under the Buena Vista presents... title.\n\nFilm\nShortly after returning from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it was an effort to force Cooder to focus on the project, \"He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, and I knew he was back in Havana.\" Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer's first solo album, in 1998.\n\nWenders filmed the recording sessions on the recently enhanced format Digital Video with the help of cinematographer Robert Müller, and then shot interviews with each \"Buena Vista\" ensemble member in different Havana locations. Wenders was also present to film the group's first performance with a full line-up in Amsterdam in April 1998 (two nights) and a second time in Carnegie Hall, New York City on 1 July 1998. The completed documentary was released on 17 September 1999, and included scenes in New York of the Cubans, some of whom had never left the island, window shopping and visiting tourist sites. According to Sight & Sound magazine, these scenes of \"innocents abroad\" were the film's most moving moments, as the contrasts between societies of Havana and New York become evident on the faces of the performers. Ferrer, from an impoverished background and staunchly anti consumerist, was shown describing the city as \"beautiful\" and finding the experience overwhelming. Upon completion of filming, Wenders felt that the film \"didn't feel really like it was a documentary anymore. It felt like it was a true character piece\".\n\nThe film became a box office success, grossing $23,002,182 worldwide. Critics were generally enthusiastic about the story and especially the music, although leading U.S. film critic Roger Ebert and the British Film Institute's Peter Curran felt that Wenders had lingered too long on Cooder during the performances; and the editing, which interspersed interviews with music, had disrupted the continuity of the songs. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature in 1999. It won best documentary at the European Film Awards and received seventeen other major accolades internationally.\n\nLive performances\nThe first performances by the full line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and television appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Rubén González performed together in Los Angeles in 1998 to an audience that included Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez, Ferrer dedicating the song Mami Me Gusto to the Hispanic Lopez.\n\nPerformances in Florida, which has a large Cuban exile and Cuban American community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate. In the late 1990s, a concert by Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba turned into a near riot when concert goers were attacked and spat at by protesters opposed to the Cuban government. When \"Buena Vista\" musicians played for a music industry conference at Miami Beach in 1998, hundreds of protesters chanted outside and the convention center hall was cleared briefly because of a bomb threat. In 1999, Ferrer and Ruben González were forced to cancel Miami shows citing fears for their safety after fellow-Cubans Los Van Van drew 4,000 protesters at a previous show, and Compay Segundo was forced to cut short a 1999 Miami performance due to another bomb threat. When touring the U.S., the Cubans are only entitled to their per diem (transportation and lodging) and are not permitted performance fees due to the U.S. embargo. In 2001 a Buena Vista Social Club (with Ibrahim Ferrer) performance was recorded in Austin for PBS and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002.\n\nMusicians associated with Buena Vista Social Club have toured throughout the world as Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club, and despite the deaths of six of the original members, the collective performed with many of the remaining ensemble members including Barbarito Torres and \"Guajiro\" Mirabal. Ry Cooder's guitar parts were handled by Manuel Galbán, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer's first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as \"something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they've never really had one defining front person\", adding, \"It's hard to know what to expect from what is more of a brand than a band.\"\n\nCultural impact\nThe international success of the Buena Vista Social Club generated a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music as a whole. Musical director Juan de Marcos felt that the recordings serve \"as a symbol of the power of Cuban music, and which to a certain degree have contributed to Cuban music regaining the status it always had in Latin American and world music.\"\n\nCuba's burgeoning tourist industry of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, \"In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner.\" The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite the appeal of the \"Buena Vista\" ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the \"Buena Vista Social Club\" than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.\n\nMari Marques, a Cuban American who leads cultural tours to Cuba, contests that the preponderance of traditional musicians was not solely a consequence of the \"Buena Vista Social Club\". Marques believes the notion that some music had been completely neglected in Cuba is \"a romantic exaggeration that was propagated by U.S. media coverage\", and the reality is that son trios have existed \"everywhere in cities such as Santiago de Cuba in the east of the island.\" British world music record label Tumi Music, who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians, all as good as, and some as old as the \"Buena Vista\" participants, \"but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world.\" The label lamented that, \"for the West to pay any real attention and consume the product, you needed someone like Ry Cooder to give it a stamp of approval first.\"\n\nBritish Socialist Workers Party member and Marxist writer Mike Gonzalez believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to \"timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music\". Gonzalez asserts that the aura evoked did not represent \"the real Cuba\" before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to \"enjoy the fruits of this confusion\". The American Historical Review suggested that the Buena Vista Social Club's mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s–30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959—which \"no longer seems so bad\".\n\nA stage musical adaptation with the same name as the album and focusing on the history and performers of the group was staged Off-Broadway in 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Buena+Vista+Social+Club\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mit über acht Millionen Verkäufen ist es das erfolgreichste Album des Genres Weltmusik.\n\nNach dem großen internationalen Erfolg der CD, der durch den 1999 erschienenen gleichnamigen Dokumentarfilm von Wim Wenders noch erheblich verstärkt wurde, veröffentlichte das Label World Circuit nach dem ursprünglichen Album unter Nutzung des bekannt gewordenen Namens eine Reihe von Tonträgern, an dem ein wachsender Kreis kubanischer Musiker beteiligt war, von denen einige bis heute (Stand 2014) unter Fortführung der Bezeichnung Buena Vista Social Club in unterschiedlicher Besetzung auf internationalen Tourneen auftreten.\n\nDer Name stammt von einem auf dem ersten Album enthaltenen Instrumentalstück, das einem in den Jahrzehnten vor der Kubanischen Revolution von 1959 bedeutenden afrokubanischen Kulturverein gewidmet war, dem sogenannten Club Social des Stadtviertels Buena Vista der Hauptstadt Havanna. 2017 wurde der Dokumentarfilm Buena Vista Social Club: Adios veröffentlicht.

      "biography_en": "The Buena Vista Social Club was a members club in Havana, Cuba that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 50 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.\nThe recording, named Buena Vista Social Club after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in Carnegie Hall, New York City for a documentary that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film, also called Buena Vista Social Club, was released to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards.\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, laúd player Barbarito Torres and trombonist and conductor Jesus \"Aguaje\" Ramos currently tour worldwide, to popular acclaim, with new members such as the singer Carlos Calunga, virtuoso pianist Rolando Luna and occasionally the solo singer Omara Portuondo, as part of a 13 member band called Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club.",
      "biography_es": "Buena Vista Social Club fue un club social de La Habana, Cuba, donde sus miembros practicaban actividades relacionadas con el baile y la música. Se convirtió en un sitio muy popular, donde se encontraban e interpretaban música quienes formaban parte de él.\n\nEn los años 1990, casi 50 años después de que el club se cerrase, inspiró una grabación hecha por el músico cubano Juan de Marcos González y el guitarrista estadounidense Ry Cooder con músicos cubanos tradicionales, muchos de ellos antiguos miembros del club en el que se presentaron cuando su popularidad estaba en la cumbre. La grabación, llamada Buena Vista Social Club, por esa institución de La Habana, fue un éxito internacional y el grupo se presentó con su formación completa en Ámsterdam en 1998. El director de cine alemán Wim Wenders grabó la presentación, seguida de un segundo concierto en el Carnegie Hall, de Nueva York, concierto éste que fue la cumbre del documental que resultó del trabajo de Wenders. El documental también incluye entrevistas con los músicos llevadas a cabo en La Habana. La película de Wenders, también nombrada Buena Vista Social Club, fue aclamada por los críticos y recibió una nominación al Óscar al mejor documental largo y numerosos galardones, entre los que se incluye Mejor Documental en el European Film Awards.\n\nTanto el éxito del álbum como el de la película produjeron un gran interés por la música cubana tradicional y la música latinoamericana en general, en todo el mundo. Algunos de los músicos cubanos lanzaron después álbumes en solitario que fueron bien acogidos, y grabaron otros en colaboración con diversas estrellas de la música internacional de distintos géneros. El nombre \"Buena Vista Social Club\" se convirtió en un término que abarcaba este tipo de presentaciones y lanzamientos en colaboración, además de relacionarse con una etiqueta que encapsula la \"Edad de Oro de la música Cubana\", entre los 1930 y los 1950. El nuevo éxito fue efímero para la mayoría de los miembros del grupo: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, Ibrahim Ferrer y Pío Leyva, ya que murieron pocos años después, a los 95, 84, 78 y 89 años respectivamente; Segundo y González en 2003, Ferrer en 2005 y Leyva en 2006. Se mantienen vigentes otros de los miembros principales como:Omara Portuondo, Eliades Ochoa, el trompetista Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, el percusionista Amadito Valdés, el laudista Barbarito Torres, el guitarrista Ry Cooder, su hijo el percusionista Joachim Cooder, el productor Juan de Marcos Gónzalez, Ibrahim Ferrer Jr. y Salvador Repilado (hijo de Compay Segundo).",
      "biography_fr": "Le Buena Vista Social Club était une mythique boîte de nuit dans la banlieue de La Havane à Cuba (situé « Calle 41 » entre les numéros 46 et 48, dans le quartier Marianao). Après la révolution cubaine de 1959, cette boîte de nuit disparu.\nCinquante ans après sa fermeture, son nom fut repris pour un projet musical, imaginé par Nick Gold de la maison de disques World Circuit et le guitariste américain Ry Cooder. L'idée de ce projet était de réunir dans un même enregistrement des musiciens cubains « campesinos » (soneros légendaires des années 1930, 40 et 50), et des musiciens d'Afrique de l'Ouest. Retenus à l'aéroport de Paris, les Africains ne purent se rendre à Cuba, et finalement l'enregistrement de l'album s'effectua sans eux.\nL'album (intitulé Buena Vista Social Club) rencontra un tel succès que le groupe fut incité à se produire sur scène à Amsterdam en 1998, suivi de plusieurs concerts au Carnegie Hall de New York.\nLe cinéaste Wim Wenders fut sollicité pour les filmer. Il en fit un documentaire, en ajoutant les interviews, effectués à La Havane, des différents musiciens. Le film fut lui aussi intitulé Buena Vista Social Club.",

      "biography_nl": "Buena Vista Social Club is een groep Cubaanse muzikanten. De groep is vernoemd naar een club met dezelfde naam die tot in de jaren veertig bestond in de Cubaanse hoofdstad Havana. Deze club was destijds een trefpunt voor muzikaal Havana. In 1996 werd de band opgericht onder leiding van de Amerikaans gitarist en producer Ry Cooder en de Cubaan Juan de Marcos González. Het bijzondere van deze band is dat alle leden mannen op leeftijd zijn. Een aantal van hen had destijds al in de betreffende club gespeeld en pakten hun muziekcarrière weer op. De allereerste opname was zo'n succes dat ze wereldberoemd werden, wat leidde tot optredens in onder meer Theater Carré in Amsterdam en Carnegie Hall in New York. Hun meest bekende nummer is Chan Chan uit 1997.\n\nWim Wenders heeft in 1999 een documentaire over de band gemaakt met als naam Buena Vista Social Club. Deze film werd genomineerd voor een Academy Award voor Beste Documentaire.\n\nEen aantal leden is inmiddels overleden en vervangen door jongere muzikanten. Ook heeft een aantal leden naast hun optredens voor de groep een solocarrière gehad.",

Ao longo dos anos novos membros entraram no grupo.\n\nNa década de 1990, aproximadamente 40 anos após o fechamento do clube, inspirou uma gravação do músico cubano Juan de Marcos González e o guitarrista americano Ry Cooder com os músicos tradicionais, o disco, chamado Buena Vista Social Club tornou-se um sucesso internacional. Foi quando então o diretor alemão Wim Wenders filmou a apresentação do grupo na Holanda, e uma segunda apresentação no famoso Carnegie Hall em Nova York, transformando num documentário, acompanhado de entrevistas feitas em Havana com os músicos.\n\nO filme, chamado Buena Vista Social Club, foi aclamado pela crítica, sendo indicado ao Oscar na categoria Melhor Documentário e ganhando o prêmio de Melhor documentário no European Film Awards.\n\nBUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Performance.\n\nEm 2006 foi lançado Rhythms del Mundo, um ábum com as estrelas do Buena Vista e da música cubana Ibrahim Ferrer (sua última gravação antes de morrer em 2005) e Omara Portuondo com artistas como U2, Coldplay, Sting, Jack Johnson, Maroon 5, Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs entre outros.",
