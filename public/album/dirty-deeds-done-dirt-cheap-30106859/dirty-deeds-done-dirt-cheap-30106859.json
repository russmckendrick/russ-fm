      "biography": "AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, who continued as members until Malcolm's illness and departure in 2014. Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply \"rock and roll\".\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same—their longest unchanged line-up—until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles.\nAC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, making them the tenth-best-selling band in the United States and one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist – and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\"In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".",

            "content": "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is the second international studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in December 1976 in Europe and delayed for release in the U.S. until April 1981. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nOriginally released on Atlantic Records, it peaked at #3 and is currently certified 6x platinum by the RIAA. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\n\n \nOverview\nThis edition of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is considerably different from the original Australian edition released in September 1976, featuring a different cover and track order.\n\nOn this album, the Australian version's \"R.I.P. (Rock in Peace)\" and \"Jailbreak\" are replaced by \"Rocker\" (from 1975's T.N.T.) and \"Love at First Feel\", the latter being one of only two tracks from international AC/DC albums not available on the band's Australian albums. (The other is \"Cold Hearted Man\", released on European pressings of Powerage.) Conversely, several songs that are available on Australian AC/DC albums have not seen overseas release. However, \"Love at First Feel\" was released in Australia as a single.\n\nThough the international album was released by Atlantic Records in Europe in 1976 it was not picked up for U.S. release at the time. Following the American success of Highway To Hell in late 1979 import copies of the album, began to appear as imports in the U.S. Some of these imports were the original Australian edition on Albert Productions. However Atlantic Records also pressed the international version in Australia and many of these copies were also exported to the U.S. Strong demand for both import versions eventually led the U.S. division of Atlantic to finally authorize an official U.S. release in April 1981 which went straight to #3 on the Billboard album charts.\n\nTwo songs on the international album were edited from the full length versions on the original Australian album. The full length \"Dirty Deeds\" has the title of the song chanted 4 times starting at 3:09, but on the edited version the chant is heard only 2 times. \"Ain't No Fun\" lasted 7:29 on the Australian album but was faded out early to 6:57 on the international version. However, both these full length versions were restored on the 1994 Atco Records remastered CD of the international album. The most recent 2003 CD edition on Epic Records goes back to the edited versions as on the 1976 and 1981 international vinyl editions.\n\nAdditionally, a song titled \"I'm a Rebel\" was recorded during the Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap sessions in September 1976, with music and lyrics written by Angus and Malcolm Young's older brother, Alex Young. This song was never released and remains in Albert Productions' vaults.\n\nAngus came up with the title of the album when he was watching an episode of Beany And Cecil. The antagonist, Dishonest John, carried a card that read: \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Special Holidays, Sundays and Rates\".\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\n\nSide A\n\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" – 4:11 (full length version) 3:52 (edited version) \n\"Love at First Feel\" – 3:13 \n\"Big Balls\" – 2:39 \n\"Rocker\" – 2:52 \n\"Problem Child\" – 5:47 \n\nSide B\n\"There's Gonna Be Some Rockin'\" – 3:18 \n\"Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)\" – 7:29 (full length version), 6:58 (edited version) \n\"Ride On\" – 5:54 \n\"Squealer\" – 5:27 \nMost editions of this album contain edited versions of the title track and \"Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire).\" The 1994 remastered CD on Atco Records contains full length versions of both songs. \nThe track \"Rocker\" was originally released on T.N.T. in 1975. \n\nPersonnel\nBon Scott – lead vocals \nAngus Young – lead guitar/backing vocals on 1 \nMalcolm Young – rhythm guitar, backing vocals \nMark Evans – bass guitar/backing vocals on 2-9 \nPhil Rudd – drums \n\n Production\nProducers: Harry Vanda, George Young \nMastering supervisors: Michael Fraser, Al Quaglieri \nDigital remastering: George Marino \nDigital assembly: Eugene Nastasi \nCover design: Hipgnosis \nSleeve photo: Paul Canty \nPhotography: Hipgnosis, Philip Morris, Michael Putland, Neil Zlozower \n\n Charts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1981 Pop Albums 3 \n\nSingles - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Single Chart Position \n1981 \"Big Balls\" Mainstream Rock 26 \n1981 \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" Mainstream Rock 4 \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/Dirty+Deeds+Done+Dirt+Cheap\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
