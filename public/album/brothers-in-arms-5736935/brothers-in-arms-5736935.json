      "biography": "Dire Straits were a British rock band formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). They were active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.\n\nTheir first single, \"Sultans of Swing\", from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by a series of hit singles including \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1981), \"Private Investigations\" (1982), \"Twisting by the Pool\" (1983), \"Money for Nothing\" (1985), and \"Walk of Life\" (1985). Their most commercially successful album, \"Brothers in Arms\" (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc (CD) and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK history. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, the fifth most of all time.\n\nDire Straits' sound drew from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who remained with the band for its whole history. After their first breakup in 1988, Mark Knopfler told Rolling Stone: \"A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.\" They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined numerous reunion offers.\n\nDire Straits were called \"the biggest British rock band of the 80s\" by Classic Rock magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold between 100 and 120 million units worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Straits\n\nDiscography\nDire Straits (1978)\nCommuniqué (1979)\nMaking Movies (1980)\nLove over Gold (1982)\nBrothers in Arms (1985)\nOn Every Street (1991) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dire+Straits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The first half of the album is a development of their unique brand of arena rock which had evolved in their music since the 1980 album Making Movies, while the second half consists of more folk-influenced material. The whole album maintains the original Dire Straits' bluesy and laid back guitar-based sound whilst retaining a more lavish and bombastic production and overall sound. It is the band's best selling album. \n\nBrothers in Arms was one of the first albums to be directed at the CD market, and was a full digital recording (DDD), at a time when most popular music was recorded on analog equipment. It was also released on vinyl and cassette.\n\nBrothers in Arms was the first album to sell one million copies in the CD format and to outsell its LP version. A Rykodisc staffer would subsequently write, \" were fighting to get our CDs manufactured because the entire worldwide manufacturing capacity was overwhelmed by demand for a single rock title (Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms).\"\n\nIt was remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the U.S. and on September 19, 2000 in the United States. It was also released in XRCD2 format in 2000, Super Audio CD format on July 26, 2005 and DualDisc format on August 16, 2005, winning a Grammy for Best Surround Sound Album.\n\nIn 2006, a half-speed-mastered vinyl version of the album was issued. Mastered by the renowned Stan Ricker, this version puts the full-length songs on vinyl for the first time. In order to do this, the album spans four sides on two 33 1/3 rpm discs.\n\nIn 2000 Q magazine placed Brothers in Arms at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 351 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In November 2006, the results of a national poll conducted by the public of Australia revealed their top 100 favourite albums. Brothers in Arms came in at number 64 (see \"My Favourite Album\").\n\nAs of April 30 2008, Brothers in Arms was 5th on the list of best-selling albums (UK) and is the 107th best-selling album in the United States.\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards.\n\nPersonnel:\nMark Knopfler: guitar, lead vocals\nJohn Illsley: bass, vocals\nAlan Clark: organ, synth, piano\nGuy Fletcher: synth, vocals\nTerry Williams: drums\nAdditional Personnel:\nOmar Hakim: drums\nJack Sonni: guitar\nMichael Brecker: saxophone\nRandy Brecker: horn\nMalcolm Duncan: tenor saxophone\nNeil Jason: bass\nTony Levin: bass\nJimmy Maelen: percussion\nMichael Mainieri: background vocals\nDave Plews: horn\nSting: vocals on Money for Nothing\"\n\nReleased 13 May 1985\nRecorded November 1984 - March 1985 AIR Studios, Montserrat\nAIR Studios, London - Power Station, New York\nLength 55:07 (CD)\n47:21 (LP)\nLabel Vertigo (UK), Warner Bros.
