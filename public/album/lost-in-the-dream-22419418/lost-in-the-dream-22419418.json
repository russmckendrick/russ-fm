      "biography": "The War on Drugs is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed in 2005. The band consists of Adam Granduciel (vocals, guitar), David Hartley (bass), Robbie Bennett (keyboards), Charlie Hall (drums), Jon Natchez (saxophone) and Anthony LaMarca (guitar). \nFounded by close collaborators Granduciel and Kurt Vile, The War on Drugs released their debut studio album, Wagonwheel Blues, in 2008. Vile departed shortly after its release to focus on his solo career. The band's second studio album Slave Ambient was released in 2011 to critical acclaim and extensive touring. \nWritten and recorded following extensive touring and a period of loneliness and depression for primary songwriter Granduciel, the band's third album, Lost in the Dream, was released in 2014 to widespread critical acclaim and increased exposure. Previous collaborator Charlie Hall joined the band as its full-time drummer during the recording process, with saxophonist Jon Natchez and additional guitarist Anthony LaMarca accompanying the band for its world tour. \n\nHistory:\n\nBeginnings and Wagonwheel Blues (2003-2008):\nIn 2003, frontman Adam Granduciel moved from Oakland, California to Philadelphia, where he met Kurt Vile, who had also recently moved back to Philadelphia after living in Boston for two years. The duo subsequently began writing, recording and performing music together. Vile stated, \"Adam was the first dude I met when I moved back to the Philadelphia in 2003. We saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things. I was obsessed with Bob Dylan at the time, and we totally geeked-out on that. We started playing together in the early days and he would be in my band, The Violators. Then, eventually I played in The War On Drugs.\" \nGranduciel and Vile began playing as The War on Drugs in 2005, self-releasing a demo EP. Regarding the band's name, Granduciel noted, \"My friend Julian and I came up with it a few years ago over a couple bottles of red wine and a few typewriters when we were living in Oakland. We were writing a lot back then, working on a dictionary, and it just came out and we were like \"hey, good band name\" so eventually when I moved to Philadelphia and got a band together I used it. It was either that or The Rigatoni Danzas. I think we made the right choice. I always felt though that it was the kind of name I could record all sorts of different music under without any sort of predictability inherent in the name\" \nWhile Vile and Granduciel formed the backbone of the band, they had a number of accompanists early in the group's career, before finally settling on a lineup that added Charlie Hall as drummer/organist, Kyle Lloyd as drummer and Dave Hartley on bass. Granduciel had previously toured and recorded with The Capitol Years, and Vile has several solo albums. The group gave away its Barrel of Batteries EP for free early in 2008. Their debut LP for Secretly Canadian, Wagonwheel Blues, was released in 2008. \nFollowing the album's release, and subsequent European tour, Vile departed from the band to focus on his solo career, stating, \"I only went on the first European tour when their album came out, and then I basically left the band. I knew if I stuck with that, it would be all my time and my goal was to have my own musical career.\" Fellow Kurt Vile & the Violators bandmate Mike Zanghi joined the band at this time, with Vile noting, \"Mike was my drummer first and then when The War On Drugs' first record came out I thought I was lending Mike to Adam for the European tour but then he just played with them all the time so I kind of had to like, while they were touring a lot, figure out my own thing.\" \n\nSlave Ambient (2008-2012):\nThe lineup underwent several changes, and by the end of 2008, Kurt Vile, Charlie Hall, and Kyle Lloyd had all exited the group. At that time Granduciel and Hartley were joined by drummer Mike Zanghi. After Zanghi's exit in 2010, Steven Urgo took over drum duties and Robbie Bennett joined on keys. The band's second studio album, Slave Ambient was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2011. \nIn 2012, Patrick Berkery replaced Urgo as the band's drummer. \n\nLost in the Dream (2013-present):\n\nOn 4 December 2013 the band announced the upcoming release of its third studio album, Lost in the Dream (March 18, 2014). The band streamed the album in its entirety on NPR's First Listen site for a week before its release. \n\nSide projects and collaborations:\n\nKurt Vile & the Violators:\nAdam Granduciel and Mike Zanghi are both former members of founding guitarist Kurt Vile's backing band The Violators, with Granduciel noting, \"There was never, despite what lazy journalists have assumed, any sort of falling out, or resentment\" following Vile's departure from The War on Drugs. In 2011, Vile stated, \"When my record came out, I assumed Adam would want to focus on The War On Drugs but he came with us in The Violators when we toured the States. The Violators became a unit, and although the cast does rotate, we've developed an even tighter unity and sound. Adam is an incredible guitar player these days and there is a certain feeling between us that nobody else can tap into. We don't really have to tell each other what to play, it just happens.\" \n\nSharon Van Etten:\nBoth David Hartley and Adam Granduciel contributed to singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten's fourth studio album, Are We There (2014). Hartley performs bass guitar on the entire album, with Granduciel contributing guitar on two tracks. \n\nSore Eros:\nAdam Granduciel is currently producing the new Sore Eros album. They have been recording it in Philadelphia on and off for the past year and half. \n\nMembers:\n\nCurrent \nAdam Granduciel - vocals, guitars, harmonica, keyboards, samplers (2005-present), \nDavid Hartley - bass guitar, electric guitars (2005-present), \nRobbie Bennett - keyboards, piano, guitars (2010-present), \nCharlie Hall - drums, organ (2013-present, previously an occasional member), \nJon Natchez - saxophone, keyboards (2014 - present), \nAnthony LaMarca - guitar, keyboards (2014-present), \nFormer \nPatrick Berkery - drums, percussion (2012-2013), \nSteven Urgo - drums, percussion, sampler (2010-2012), \nMike Zanghi - drums, percussion, sampler (2008-2010), \nKyle Lloyd - drums, \nKurt Vile - electric guitar (2005-2009)",

The War on Drugs’ fourth full-length operates with a bigger, bolder agenda—evident in the clattering electronics and hypnotic production of the nearly nine-minute opener, “Under the Pressure”. From there, <i>Lost in the Dream</i> unfolds with warm, melancholic rock that combines Granduciel’s mystical tenor with a blurry haze of vintage synths, chiming guitars, horn accents and reverb-soaked ambience. Uptempo tracks like “Red Eyes” and “An Ocean in Between the Waves” juxtapose pulsing, mechanical backbeats with droning synths. Ballads, like the heartbreaking “Suffering” and the gently paced title track, float along in a beautiful fog. After <i>Lost in the Dream</i> closes with a couple of minutes of wordless feedback, the album leaves a hypnotic, lingering impression.",

            "content": "Lost In The Dream is the third album by Philadelphia band The War on Drugs, but in many ways, it feels like the first. Around the release of the 2011 breakthrough Slave Ambient, Adam Granduciel spent the bulk of two years on the road, touring through progressively larger rock clubs, festival stages and late-night television slots. As these dozen songs shifted and grew beyond what they'd been in the studio, The War on Drugs became a bona fide rock 'n' roll band.\n\nThat essence drives Lost In The Dream, a 10-song set produced by Granduciel and longtime engineer Jeff Zeigler. In the past, Granduciel built the core of songs largely by himself. But these tunes were played and recorded by the group that had solidified so much on the road: Dave Hartley, (his favorite bassist in the world), who had played a bit on The War on Drugs' 2008 debut Wagonwheel Blues, and pianist Robbie Bennett, a multi-instrumentalist who contributed to Slave Ambient. This unit spent eight months bouncing between a half-dozen different studios that stretched from the mountains of North Carolina to the boroughs of New York City. Only then did Granduciel--the proudly self-professed gearhead, and unrepentant perfectionist--add and subtract, invite guests and retrofit pieces. He sculpted these songs into a musical rescue mission, through and then beyond personal despair and anxiety. Lost In The Dream represents the trials of the trip and the triumphs of its destination.\n\n\"I wanted there to be a singular voice, but I wanted it to be a project of great friends. Everyone in the band cares about it so much,\" he says. \"That is the crux of it--growing up, dealing with life, having close friends, helping each other get by. That is what the record's all about.\"\n\nAs such, these tunes reveal a careful and thrilling reinvention of the sound that's become The War on Drugs' trademark. The signature meld of long tones and scattershot layers still stands, with phantom drum machines and organ lines dotting the musical middle distance all across Lost In The Dream. Note the way the keys whisper against the guitar's growl as the tempestuous \"An Ocean in Between the Waves\" approaches pentecostal heat. Hear how, when a sharp and hard riff cuts into the inescapable chorus of \"Red Eyes,\" synthetic strings and baritone saxophone shape a soft, infinite bed beneath it.\n\nBut there's a newfound directness to these tunes, too. Granduciel's voice steps out from behind its typical web of effects--louder now, with more experiences to share and more steel from having survived them. He sounds less like a prismatic reflection of a rock bandleader, more like the emboldened actualization of that idea. With its crisp, unencumbered delivery, \"Eyes to the Wind\" becomes the album's centerpiece and the group's new anthem. This is Granduciel's to-date triumph and the exact moment where Lost In The Dream moves from a tale of confusion to one of resolve. Throughout most of the record, grips loosen and senses fail, memories are mourned and expectations are abandoned. But after the Rolling Thunder lift of \"Eyes to the Wind,\" Granduciel finds new contentment and direction. Anguish sublimates into deliverance. Backed by his bros, Granduciel becomes a preacher in a new pulpit.\n\n(SC310 released: 03/18/14) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+War+on+Drugs/Lost+in+the+Dream\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
