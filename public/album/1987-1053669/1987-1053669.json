      "biography": "Whitesnake are an English hard rock band formed in London in 1978. The group was originally put together as the backing band for singer David Coverdale, who had recently left Deep Purple. Though the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout their history.\n\nWhitesnake enjoyed much success in the UK, Europe and Japan through their early years. Their albums Ready an' Willing, Come an' Get It and Saints & Sinners all reached the top ten on the UK Albums Chart. By the mid-1980s, however, Coverdale had set his sights on breaking through in North America, where Whitesnake remained largely unknown. With the backing of American label Geffen Records, Whitesnake released Slide It In in 1984, followed by an eponymous album in 1987, which became their biggest success to date, selling over eight million copies in the US and spawning the hit singles \"Here I Go Again\" and \"Is This Love\".\n\nWhitesnake also adopted a more contemporary look, akin to the Los Angeles glam metal scene. After releasing Slip of the Tongue in 1989, Coverdale decided to put Whitesnake on hold to take a break from the music industry. Aside from a few short-lived reunions in the 1990s, Whitesnake remained mostly inactive until 2003, when Coverdale put together a new line-up to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary. Since then Whitesnake have released four more studio albums and toured extensively around the world.\n\nWhitesnake's early sound has been characterized by critics as blues rock, but by the mid-1980s the band slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible hard rock style. Topics such as love and sex are common in Whitesnake's lyrics, which have been criticized for their excessive use of sexual innuendos and double entendres. Whitesnake have been nominated for several awards during their career, including Best British Group at the 1988 Brit Awards. They have also been featured on lists of the greatest hard rock bands of all time by several media outlets, while their songs and albums have appeared on many \"best of\" lists by outlets, such as VH1 and Rolling Stone.",

            "content": "Whitesnake (also known as Serpens Albus in Japan and 1987 in the UK and Europe) is the eighth studio album by British hard rock band of the same name (Whitesnake), released in 1987. The album was a major crossover hit and one of the top-selling albums in the glam metal genre, eventually selling over eight million copies in the United States alone (and thus going eight times platinum). The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Its success even boosted its predecessor, Slide It In, from gold to double platinum status.\n\nIn Europe the album was called 1987 which featured a different running order and two extra tracks, \"Looking for Love\" and \"You're Gonna Break My Heart Again\"; and in Japan the album was \"titled\" / \"catch phrased\" on the obi strips as Serpens Albus because of the text on the albums artwork which, in Latin, means \"Whitesnake\"). The two extra European tracks would be released in America in the 90s on Whitesnake's Greatest Hits.\n\nAfter the album was recorded, lead singer David Coverdale fired the band members who had played on the recordings: John Sykes (guitar), who went on to found Blue Murder; Neil Murray (bass); and Aynsley Dunbar (drums). Adrian Vandenberg, who played on the solo to \"Here I Go Again,\" joined the band on a full-time basis after the other members were gone.\n\nThe album produced three major crossover hit singles: the Led Zeppelin-influenced \"Still of the Night\", \"Here I Go Again\", the band's only #1 single in the U.S. and the power ballad \"Is This Love\", which reached #2 on the U.S. singles chart. They also had hits in Britain with the aforementioned three singles, as well as \"Give Me All Your Love\", which reached #18.\n\n\"Here I Go Again\" and \"Crying In The Rain\" originally appeared on the Saints & Sinners album. These songs were rerecorded for the new release here. An alternate radio version of \"Here I Go Again\" of this album's recording did not appear on the album but was later included as a bonus track on Whitesnake's Greatest Hits.\n\nAll videos from the album earned substantial airplay on MTV in part due to appearances by Tawny Kitaen, then the wife of Whitesnake lead singer David Coverdale.\n\nThe album's success paved the way for other Zeppelin-derived acts, such as Kingdom Come, to find commercial success in the U.S.\n\nA remastered reissue of the album featuring a DVD with videoclips and live performances was released as a 20th anniversary edition.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by David Coverdale and John Sykes except where noted.\n\n\n North American version\n\"Crying in the Rain 87\" (Coverdale) – 5:37 \n\"Bad Boys\" – 4:09 \n\"Still of the Night\" – 6:41 \n\"Here I Go Again 87\" (Coverdale, Bernie Marsden) – 4:35 \n\"Give Me All Your Love\" – 3:30 \n\"Is This Love\" – 4:45 \n\"Children of the Night\" – 4:24 \n\"Straight for the Heart\" – 3:40 \n\"Don't Turn Away\" – 5:11 \n\n European version (1987)\n\"Still of the Night\" – 6:36 \n\"Bad Boys\" – 4:06 \n\"Give Me All Your Love\" – 3:31 \n\"Looking for Love\" – 6:33 (not on US release) \n\"Crying in the Rain 87\" (Coverdale) – 5:37 \n\"Is This Love\" – 4:43 \n\"Straight for the Heart\" – 3:39 \n\"Don't Turn Away\" – 5:10 \n\"Children of the Night\" – 4:24 \n\"Here I Go Again 87\" (Coverdale, Marsden) – 4:34 \n\"You're Gonna Break My Heart Again\" – 4:11 (not on US release) \n\"Here I Go Again\" (Radio Mix, Bonus track) - 3:53 \n\nThe two tracks not on the US release were eventually given an American release on Whitesnake's Greatest Hits.\n\nFor Here I Go Again and Crying in the Rain, the \"87\" is not actually part of the song title. Rather, it has been included to avoid confusion with the earlier versions of these songs that appeared on older Whitesnake albums.\n\nTrack 12 is included in Greatest Hits compilation released in 1994\n\n\n20th Anniversary Edition\nCD Bonus Tracks\n\nLive...In The Shadow Of The Blues\n\nGive Me All Your Love \nIs This Love \nHere I Go Again \nStill Of The Night \nDVD\n\nThe Videos \"Trilogy\"\n\nStill Of The Night \nHere I Go Again \nIs This Love \nGive Me All Your Love \nLive...In The Still Of The Night\n\nGive Me All Your Love \nIs This Love \nHere I Go Again \nStill Of The Night \n\n Singles\n\"Here I Go Again 87\" \n\"Is This Love\" \n\"Still of the Night\" \n\"Give Me All Your Love\" \n\nPersonnel\nDavid Coverdale – lead vocals \nJohn Sykes – guitar, backing vocals \nNeil Murray – bass \nAynsley Dunbar – drums \n\n Special guests\nDon Airey – keyboards \nBill Cuomo – keyboards \nAdrian Vandenberg – guitar solo (\"Here I Go Again 87\") \nDann Huff - guitar (\"Here I Go Again 87\" - Radio Mix/Edit version) \nDenny Carmassi - drums (\"Here I Go Again 87\" - Radio Mix/Edit version) \nVivian Campbell - guitar solo (\"Give Me All Your Love\" - Radio Mix/Edit version) \n\nAdditional\nProduced by Mike Stone & Keith Olsen \nMixed by Keith Olsen at Goodnight LA \nMastered by Greg Fulginiti at Artisan Sound Recorders \nJohn Kalodner - A&R \nCover by Hugh Syme \n\nChart positions\n\nAlbum\nYear Chart Position \n1987 The Billboard 200 2 \n1987 U.K. Albums Chart 8 \n\n\nSingles\nYear Single Chart Position \n1987 \"Still of the Night\" The Billboard Hot 100 79 \n1987 \"Still of the Night\" Mainstream Rock Tracks 18 \n1987 \"Here I Go Again\" The Billboard Hot 100 1 \n1987 \"Here I Go Again\" Mainstrean Rock Tracks 3 \n1987 \"Is This Love\" The Billboard Hot 100 2 \n1987 \"Is This Love\" Mainstrean Rock Tracks 13 \n1988 \"Give Me All of Your Love\" The Billboard Hot 100 48 \n1987 \"Give Me All of Your Love\" Mainstrean Rock Tracks 22 \n\n\nTrivia\n Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided.

(October 2007) \n\nIn the video for \"Still of the Night\", part of the instrumental string interlude is visualized using a bow on an electric guitar but the strings were recorded by Don Airey using either a synthesizer or a sampler. \nThe videos for \"Still of the Night\",\"Here I Go Again\", \"Is This Love\" and \"Give Me All Your Love\", apart of David Coverdale himself, feature the touring line-up of Vivian Campbell, Adrian Vandenberg, Rudy Sarzo, and Tommy Aldridge, though they never took part on the recordings, except for Vandenberg, who played on the solo for \"Here I Go Again\", and Campbell who re-recorded the solo for the video and single version of \"Give Me All Your Love\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Whitesnake/1987\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

An alternate radio version of \"Here I Go Again\" of this album's recording did not appear on the album but was later included as a bonus track on Whitesnake's Greatest Hits.\n\nAll videos from the album earned substantial airplay on MTV in part due to appearances by Tawny Kitaen, then the wife of Whitesnake lead singer David Coverdale.\n\nThe album's success paved the way for other Zeppelin-derived acts, such as Kingdom Come, to find commercial success in the U.S.\n\nA remastered reissue of the album featuring a DVD with videoclips and live performances was released as a 20th anniversary edition.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by David Coverdale and John Sykes except where noted.\n\n\n North American version\n\"Crying in the Rain 87\" (Coverdale) – 5:37 \n\"Bad Boys\" – 4:09 \n\"Still of the Night\" – 6:41 \n\"Here I Go Again 87\" (Coverdale, Bernie Marsden) – 4:35 \n\"Give Me All Your Love\" – 3:30 \n\"Is This Love\" – 4:45 \n\"Children of the Night\" – 4:24 \n\"Straight for the Heart\" – 3:40 \n\"Don't Turn Away\" – 5:11 \n\n European version (1987)\n\"Still of the Night\" – 6:36 \n\"Bad Boys\" – 4:06 \n\"Give Me All Your Love\" – 3:31 \n\"Looking for Love\" – 6:33 (not on US release) \n\"Crying in the Rain 87\" (Coverdale) – 5:37 \n\"Is This Love\" – 4:43 \n\"Straight for the Heart\" – 3:39 \n\"Don't Turn Away\" – 5:10 \n\"Children of the Night\" – 4:24 \n\"Here I Go Again 87\" (Coverdale, Marsden) – 4:34 \n\"You're Gonna Break My Heart Again\" – 4:11 (not on US release) \n\"Here I Go Again\" (Radio Mix, Bonus track) - 3:53 \n\nThe two tracks not on the US release were eventually given an American release on Whitesnake's Greatest Hits.\n\nFor Here I Go Again and Crying in the Rain, the \"87\" is not actually part of the song title. Rather, it has been included to avoid confusion with the earlier versions of these songs that appeared on older Whitesnake albums.\n\nTrack 12 is included in Greatest Hits compilation released in 1994\n\n\n20th Anniversary Edition\nCD Bonus Tracks\n\nLive...In The Shadow Of The Blues\n\nGive Me All Your Love \nIs This Love \nHere I Go Again \nStill Of The Night \nDVD\n\nThe Videos \"Trilogy\"\n\nStill Of The Night \nHere I Go Again \nIs This Love \nGive Me All Your Love \nLive...In The Still Of The Night\n\nGive Me All Your Love \nIs This Love \nHere I Go Again \nStill Of The Night \n\n Singles\n\"Here I Go Again 87\" \n\"Is This Love\" \n\"Still of the Night\" \n\"Give Me All Your Love\" \n\nPersonnel\nDavid Coverdale – lead vocals \nJohn Sykes – guitar, backing vocals \nNeil Murray – bass \nAynsley Dunbar – drums \n\n Special guests\nDon Airey – keyboards \nBill Cuomo – keyboards \nAdrian Vandenberg – guitar solo (\"Here I Go Again 87\") \nDann Huff - guitar (\"Here I Go Again 87\" - Radio Mix/Edit version) \nDenny Carmassi - drums (\"Here I Go Again 87\" - Radio Mix/Edit version) \nVivian Campbell - guitar solo (\"Give Me All Your Love\" - Radio Mix/Edit version) \n\nAdditional\nProduced by Mike Stone & Keith Olsen \nMixed by Keith Olsen at Goodnight LA \nMastered by Greg Fulginiti at Artisan Sound Recorders \nJohn Kalodner - A&R \nCover by Hugh Syme \n\nChart positions\n\nAlbum\nYear Chart Position \n1987 The Billboard 200 2 \n1987 U.K. Albums Chart 8 \n\n\nSingles\nYear Single Chart Position \n1987 \"Still of the Night\" The Billboard Hot 100 79 \n1987 \"Still of the Night\" Mainstream Rock Tracks 18 \n1987 \"Here I Go Again\" The Billboard Hot 100 1 \n1987 \"Here I Go Again\" Mainstrean Rock Tracks 3 \n1987 \"Is This Love\" The Billboard Hot 100 2 \n1987 \"Is This Love\" Mainstrean Rock Tracks 13 \n1988 \"Give Me All of Your Love\" The Billboard Hot 100 48 \n1987 \"Give Me All of Your Love\" Mainstrean Rock Tracks 22 \n\n\nTrivia\n Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or articles. (October 2007) \n\nIn the video for \"Still of the Night\", part of the instrumental string interlude is visualized using a bow on an electric guitar but the strings were recorded by Don Airey using either a synthesizer or a sampler. \nThe videos for \"Still of the Night\",\"Here I Go Again\", \"Is This Love\" and \"Give Me All Your Love\", apart of David Coverdale himself, feature the touring line-up of Vivian Campbell, Adrian Vandenberg, Rudy Sarzo, and Tommy Aldridge, though they never took part on the recordings, except for Vandenberg, who played on the solo for \"Here I Go Again\", and Campbell who re-recorded the solo for the video and single version of \"Give Me All Your Love\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Whitesnake/1987\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
