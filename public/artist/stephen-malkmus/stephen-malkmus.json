His works released under his own name or as part of Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks include Stephen Malkmus (2001. with The Jicks), Pig Lib (2003, with The Jicks), Face the Truth (2005), Real Emotional Trash (2008, with The Jicks) and several singles. \n\nMalkmus knew fellow Pavement songwriter Scott Kannberg (aka Spiral Stairs), of the Preston School of Industry, since childhood in Stockton, California.  Malkmus attended the University of Virginia, where his father is also an alumnus. While at UVA, he also met Bob Nastanovich, another member of Pavement.  \n\nMalkmus currently resides in Portland, Oregon with his partner, artist Jessica Jackson Hutchins. In 2005, Hutchins gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Lottie.\n\nIn 2008 Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks released the album, Real Emotional Trash — the group’s first album with new drummer Janet Weiss from Sleater-Kinney.  In 2020, Stephen released Traditional Techniques.  Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as \"an amiably trippy and decisively mellow psych-folk adventure.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Malkmus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
