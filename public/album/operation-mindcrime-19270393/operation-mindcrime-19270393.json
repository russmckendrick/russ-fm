      "biography": "Queensrÿche are an American heavy metal band. They formed in 1980 in Bellevue, Washington, out of the local band the Mob. The band has released 15 studio albums, one EP, and several DVDs, and continues to tour and record. The original lineup consisted of guitarists Michael Wilton and Chris DeGarmo, drummer Scott Rockenfield, bassist Eddie Jackson, and lead vocalist Geoff Tate.\n\nQueensrÿche has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including over 6 million albums in the United States. They are considered one of the leaders of the progressive metal scene of the mid-to-late 1980s, and often referred to as one of the \"Big Three\" of the genre, along with Dream Theater and Fates Warning. The band received worldwide acclaim after the release of their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime, which is often considered one of the greatest heavy metal concept albums of all time. Their follow-up release, Empire, released in 1990, was also very successful and included the hit single \"Silent Lucidity\". The band has received three Grammy Award nominations for songs from both albums. In 1998, drummer Rockenfield received an individual Grammy nomination.\n\nAlso in 1998, guitarist and primary songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons, returning briefly in 2003 to write and record the Tribe album. Over the years, his replacements have been Kelly Gray, Mike Stone, and Parker Lundgren. Following a highly publicized backstage altercation before a show in São Paulo, Brazil, in April 2012, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with then-Crimson Glory singer Todd La Torre. In response to his dismissal, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005 to 2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The ruling in the preliminary injunction was that both parties were allowed to use the name Queensrÿche until a court ruling or a settlement decided who would get to use the name. A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014, in which founding members Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson were awarded the rights to the band trademark, continuing to play with the lineup that additionally includes singer La Torre and guitarist Lundgren.\n\nDuring the time, both parties could use the name Queensrÿche, Tate created his own lineup featuring former guitarist Gray and musicians from bands including Blue Öyster Cult, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake, Dio, AC/DC and Quiet Riot. This version of Queensrÿche with Geoff Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23, 2013, while Queensrÿche (with La Torre replacing Tate) released their eponymous album on June 24 and 25, 2013 (European and American release date, respectively). Both bands toured in 2013 and 2014.\n\nFull article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensrÿche\n\nStudio albums\nThe Warning (1984)\nRage for Order (1986)\nOperation: Mindcrime (1988)\nEmpire (1990)\nPromised Land (1994)\nHear in the Now Frontier (1997)\nQ2K (1999)\nTribe (2003)\nOperation: Mindcrime II (2006)\nTake Cover (2007)\nAmerican Soldier (2009)\nDedicated to Chaos (2011)\nQueensrÿche (2013)\nCondition Hüman (2015)\nThe Verdict (2019)\nDigital Noise Alliance (2022)\n\nGeoff Tate's Queensrÿche\nFrequency Unknown (2013) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Queensr%C3%BFche\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Operation: Mindcrime is Queensrÿche's third full-length album, which was released on May 3, 1988. It is a concept album about a man becoming disillusioned with American society, and joining in a conspiratorial plot to assassinate its corrupt leaders, with spoken dialogue between songs that advances the story and ties the songs together. The album is generally considered to be the first, and still one of the most important and popular, progressive metal recordings. In January 1989, it ranked #34 on Kerrang! magazine's \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums Of All Time\".\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the tour promoting the 1990 album Empire, Operation: Mindcrime was performed in its entirety. The stage show featured video, animation and guest singer Pamela Moore as Sister Mary. This live show was successful enough that the band released it as a box set called Operation: LIVEcrime. The story was initially explored in a series of video clips for MTV in the 1989 VHS video, Video: Mindcrime.\n\nBefore filming Video: Mindcrime, the band shot a one-off promotional video in 1988 for the song \"Speak\" which only consisted of performance footage and did not include any of the story concepts that dominated the album.\n\nIn the United States, the album was certified gold a year after its release and was certified platinum in 1991.\n\nIn 2003, a 24-bit remastered version of Operation: Mindcrime was released that included live versions of \"The Mission\" and \"My Empty Room\" as bonus tracks.\n\nIn 2006, EMI released a deluxe Operation: Mindcrime box set that included the 2003 remaster, as well as an audio disc of a November 15, 1990 Hammersmith Odeon concert, with the band performing the entire album, and a bonus DVD containing Video: Mindcrime and bonus clips.\n\nThe sequel, Operation: Mindcrime II, was released on April 4, 2006, with Ronnie James Dio taking over the role of Dr. X. The subsequent tour consisted of the band performing both Operation: Mindcrime and its sequel in their entireties, back-to-back, with actors, props, an elaborate stage set, and a video screen. The live act from that tour also definitively answered the long-asked question, \"Who killed Mary?\"\n\n\nStory\nThe album begins with the protagonist, Nikki, lying in a hospital bed. He lies in a nearly catatonic state, unable to remember anything but snippets from his past. Suddenly, Nikki has a violent flashback in which his memories come flooding back in a torrent (\"I Remember Now\", \"Anarchy-X\"). He remembers how, as a heroin addict and would-be political radical frustrated with contemporary society, he was manipulated into joining a supposed secret organization dedicated to revolution (\"Revolution Calling\"). At the head of this organization is a political and religious demagogue known only as Dr. X, who, manipulating Nikki through a combination of his heroin addiction and brainwashing techniques (à la The Manchurian Candidate), uses Nikki as an assassin. Whenever Dr. X uses the word \"mindcrime\" Nikki becomes his docile puppet, a state which Dr. X uses to command Nikki to undertake any murder that the Doctor wishes (\"Operation: Mindcrime\", \"Speak\"). Through one of Dr. X's probable associates, a corrupt priest named Father William, Nikki is offered the services of a prostitute-turned-nun named Sister Mary. Details are vague whether these services are sexual or simply emotional (\"Spreading the Disease\"), though the lyrics for \"Suite Sister Mary\" seem to indicate that is the first time they engage in sex (\"Your precious cross is gone. It made me wait so long for what you gave to everyone\"). However, through his friendship and growing affection toward Sister Mary, Nikki begins to question the nature of what he is doing (\"The Mission\"). Dr. X notices this and, seeing a potential threat in Mary, orders Nikki to kill both her and the priest. Nikki goes to Mary's church and kills the priest, but after confronting Mary fails to comply with the command to murder her (\"Suite Sister Mary\"). He and Mary decided to leave the organization together, and Nikki goes to Dr. X to tell him that they are out. Dr. X, however, reminds Nikki that he is an addict, and that he is the only one who can provide his daily fix (\"The Needle Lies\"). Nikki leaves conflicted and returns to Mary, only to find her dead (\"Electric Requiem\"). He cannot cope with the loss, as well as the possibility that he himself may have killed her and not known it, and begins to succumb to insanity (\"Breaking the Silence\", \"I Don't Believe in Love\"). The police, arriving on the scene, arrest him for Mary's murder and the murders he committed for Dr. X (\"Waiting for 22\"). Because he is in a near-catatonic state, he is put into a hospital, where he starts to remember… (\"My Empty Room\", \"Eyes of a Stranger\").\n\nMary's death\nDetails about this crucial point of the story are ambiguous (in the album itself). The lyrics themselves do not hold clues, and the booklet remains vague about this part of the story.\n\nFour possible situations can be taken into account:\n\nNikki killed Mary in a brainwashed state under X's command, thus he doesn't remember. \nDr. X realized Nikki won't be able to perform the murder, so he took matters into his own hands and killed Mary himself. (Or perhaps through other mindcrimers.) \nMary committed suicide. \nThere was a third party involved \nThere are some possible interpretations on some existing clues:\n\nChris DeGarmo in an interview has noted that \"Electric Requiem\" is how \"Nikki comes back to the church and finds Mary dead hanging by her rosary\", but states that \"You don't quite know who killed her. Was it X or Nikki?\", excluding her suicide. \nThe cinematic video snippets shown during the Livecrime concerts and in the \"I Don't Believe in Love\" and \"Eyes of a Stranger\" music videos show Dr. X approaching Mary while wrapping a rosary around his fist, likely to strangle her. \nThe band released a VHS recording called Video: Mindcrime in 1989. At the time of its release, EMI claimed that Video: Mindcrime contained the answer to the question of who killed Mary. It contained videos for several songs on the album, as well as a \"hidden\" bonus video for the song \"I Don't Believe In Love,\" which appeared after the ending credits. The video featured split-screen images which \"match\" only once, toward the end of the song, to form the word \"suicide.\" \nIn the live performances of the Operation: Mindcrime album (An Evening With Queensrÿche) in 2004, Mary was shown sitting down by a telephone and receiving a \"Mindcrime!\" phone call from Dr. X, similar to Nikki's earlier; he commands her to shoot herself; she is unable to resist and complies.\n\nFeature film\nIn April 2006, while doing press for sequel Operation: Mindcrime II, vocalist Geoff Tate told MTV.com that there were plans to make feature films out of both Operation: Mindcrime and its sequel. While details since then have been virtually nonexistent, Tate stated in the interview that he had worked on a script with a screenwriter named Mark Shepherd and that the band was shipping the completed script to various Hollywood studios.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\"I Remember Now\" (Chris DeGarmo, Geoff Tate, Michael Wilton ) – 1:17 \n\"Anarchy-X\" (DeGarmo) – 1:27 \n\"Revolution Calling\" (Tate, Wilton) – 4:42 \n\"Operation: Mindcrime\" (DeGarmo, Tate, Wilton) – 4:43 \n\"Speak\" (Tate, Wilton) – 3:42 \n\"Spreading the Disease\" (Tate, Wilton) – 4:07 \n\"The Mission\" (DeGarmo) – 5:46 \n\"Suite Sister Mary\" (DeGarmo, Tate) – 10:41 \n\"The Needle Lies\" (Tate, Wilton) – 3:08 \n\"Electric Requiem\" (Scott Rockenfield, Tate) – 1:22 \n\"Breaking the Silence\" (DeGarmo, Tate) – 4:34 \n\"I Don't Believe in Love\" (DeGarmo, Tate) – 4:23 \n\"Waiting for 22\" (DeGarmo) – 1:05 \n\"My Empty Room\" (Tate, Wilton) – 1:28 \n\"Eyes of a Stranger\" (DeGarmo, Tate) – 6:39 \n\n2003 CD reissue bonus tracks\n\"The Mission (Live)\" (DeGarmo) - 6:11 \n\"My Empty Room (Live)\" (Tate, Wilton) -2:43 \nPersonnel\nBand\nGeoff Tate - Vocals \nChris DeGarmo - Guitar, background vocals \nEddie Jackson - Bass, background vocals \nMichael Wilton - Guitar, background vocals \nScott Rockenfield - Drums, percussion, keyboards \n\nCast\nPamela Moore - as Sister Mary \nAnthony Valentine - as Dr. X \nDebbie Wheeler - as the Nurse \nMike Snyder - as the Anchorman \nScott Mateer - as the Preacher \nThe Moronic Monks of Morin Heights - Choir \n\nCredits\nPeter Collins - Producer \nMichael Kamen - Orchestral arrangement \nJames Barton - Engineer, Mixing \nJim Campbell - Assistant Engineer \nBob Ludwig - Mastering \nPaul Milner - Assistant Engineer \nPaul Northfield - Engineer \nRonald Prent - Mixing Assistant \nGlen Robinson - Assistant Engineer \nSnakemeister - Conductor \n\nCharts\n\nAlbum\nBillboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1988 The Billboard 200 50 \n\n\nSingles\nYear Name Chart Position \n1989 \"Eyes of a Stranger\" US Mainstream Rock Tracks #35 \n1989 \"I Don't Believe in Love\" US Mainstream Rock Tracks #41 \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queensr%C3%BFche/Operation:+Mindcrime\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
