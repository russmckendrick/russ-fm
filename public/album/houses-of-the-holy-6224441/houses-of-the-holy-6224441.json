      "biography": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band, active in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in the history of music.\nAfter changing their name, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. Led Zeppelin disliked the releasing of tracks as singles, preferring their albums to be viewed as indivisible, whole listening experiences, helping to promote the concept of album-orientated rock. Their first two albums, with their heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound, led to Led Zeppelin being regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, even though the band's individualistic style drew from varied sources and transcends any single music genre. Their next two albums incorporated wider musical influences, particularly from folk music; the fourth, untitled album, which featured the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars\". Subsequent albums saw greater musical experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which, like the group's previous tours, earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's sudden death in 1980.",

It remains among rock’s essential albums. The follow-up never tries to emulate that achievement. Instead, <i>Houses of the Holy</i> approaches things from a diverse, genre-busting side. “The Song Remains the Same” opens things at their leisure, opting for a dense guitar-heavy maelstrom that soon gives way to the meditative seven-and-a-half minutes of “The Rain Song.” Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones work in lockstep, weaving mystical passages (the shivering mellotron-heavy “No Quarter”), dynamic acoustic/electric rock (“Over the Hills and Far Away”), reggae (“D’Yer Maker”) and both pseudo-funk (the James Brown homage “The Crunge”) and their own legitimate brand of groove rock (“The Ocean,” “Dancing Days”) always with a sense of musical space that allowed each instrument to shine individually and work within the context of the group. Led Zeppelin mastered each genre they attempted. They never shied from a new idea. And they often succeeded brilliantly with each risk.",

The album title is a dedication by the band to their fans who appeared at venues they dubbed \"Houses of the Holy.\" It was the first Led Zeppelin album to not be, at least unofficially, titled after the band. The album represents a musical turning point for Led Zeppelin, as they began to use more layering and production techniques in recording their songs. It is also the first of three albums to be completely original, the first four albums featuring at least one cover. The other two albums are Presence and In Through the Out Door.\n\nAlthough Houses of the Holy initially received mixed reviews, it has since become regarded by critics as one of Led Zeppelin's finest albums. The album provided notable additions to the band's catalogue, including \"Over the Hills and Far Away\", \"Dancing Days\", \"The Song Remains the Same\", \"D'yer Mak'er\", \"No Quarter\" and \"The Ocean\", and it has sold over 11 million copies in the United States. In 2003, the album was ranked number 149 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThis album was a stylistic turning point in the lifespan of Led Zeppelin. Guitar riffs became more layered within Jimmy Page's production techniques and departed from the blues influences of earlier records. In the album's opening opus, \"The Song Remains the Same\", and its intricate companion suite, \"The Rain Song\", Robert Plant's lyrics matured toward a less overt form of the mysticism and fantasy of previous efforts. \n\nHouses of the Holy also featured styles not heard on the first four Led Zeppelin albums. For example, \"D'yer Mak'er\" is a reggae-based tune; \"No Quarter\" features atmospheric keyboard sounds and an acoustic piano solo from John Paul Jones; \"The Crunge\" is a funk tribute to James Brown; and \"The Rain Song\" is embellished by Jones on his newly-acquired mellotron. The album's closing song \"The Ocean\", which featues an a cappella section and a doo-wop influenced coda, is dedicated to \"the ocean\" of fans who at this point of the band's career massed to Led Zeppelin concerts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Houses+of+the+Holy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
