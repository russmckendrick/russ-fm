      "biography": "Tubeway Army's main claim to fame is that Gary Webb (aka Gary Numan) first came to the public's attention here.  The band was formed in London, UK in 1977 by Gary Numan and the late Paul Gardiner.  What started as a British punk band would evolve into something quite different.  During the recording of their self-titled first album (\"Tubeway Army\") in 1978, Numan came across a Minimoog synthesizer accidentally left in the studio which would end up being used in several of the album's songs.  The change in sound served well for the band as their first album would go on to sell out its small initial pressing despite not charting.\n\nThe release of their second album \"Replicas\" in 1979 finally gave Numan the success he had been trying to achieve from the start with the single \"Are Friends Electric?\", the song topping the British charts for four weeks.  The band's cold electronic take on minimalistic pop took a little while to catch on with the music audience at large, but proved to be of lasting influence. Combining the artistic and poetic tendencies of David Bowie (especially the Berlin years) with sequenced synthesizers along the lines of Kraftwerk presaged the whole genre of techno-pop in the 1980s.\n\nIn late 1979, after the success of \"Replicas\", Numan dropped Tubeway Army and went on to record as a solo artist.\n\nIt's also worthy of note that during 1979, while his band \"Ultravox\" were on hiatus, Billy Currie collaborated with Gary on material for both \"Replicas\" and Gary's first solo album \"The Pleasure Principle\".\n\n\nThe official website can be found here: www.garynuman.co.uk\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Replicas is an album by the British band Tubeway Army, released in 1979. It was the second and final Tubeway Army LP, following a self-titled debut the previous year. After this, Tubeway Army frontman Gary Numan would continue to release records under his own name, though the musicians in Tubeway Army would continue to work with him for some time. Replicas was the first album of what Numan later termed the \"machine\" phase of his career, preceding The Pleasure Principle and Telekon, a collection linked by common themes of a dystopian science fiction future and transmutation of man/machine, coupled with an androgynous image and a synthetic rock sound.\n\nFuelled by a surprise number one hit single, \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\", the album also reached number one in the UK charts in July 1979 and was certified Gold by the BPI for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.\n\nBackground\nSomething of a concept album, Replicas was based on a book Numan hoped to complete someday, set in a not-too-distant future metropolis where Machmen (androids with cloned human skin) and other machines keep the general public cowed on orders from the Grey Men (shadowy officials). Whilst the album’s setting and lyrics were directly inspired by the science fiction of Philip K. Dick, particularly his seminal work Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the title was not. Though similar to \"Replicants\", the term used for androids in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner, based on Dick’s book, Scott’s film came out three years after Tubeway Army’s album and Dick never used the word \"Replicant\" in his original 1968 novel.\n\nRecording and music\nMusically, Numan’s main influence was the commercially unsuccessful John Foxx-led incarnation of Ultravox. Tracks like \"Speed of Life\" and \"Breaking Glass\" from David Bowie’s Low have also been cited, as have Kraftwerk’s The Man-Machine, in particular the long and wistful track \"Neon Lights\".\n\nThe recording was a development of the sound of the first Tubeway Army album. Whilst tracks like \"You Are in My Vision\" and \"It Must Have Been Years\" recalled the earlier album’s guitar-orientated rock, the rest were built solidly around an analog synthesizer, the Minimoog. Along with \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\", this included \"Me! I Disconnect from You\", the atmospheric \"Down in the Park\" (released as a single prior to the album and acquiring cult status though not commercial success), the multi-layered title track and the closing instrumentals \"When the Machines Rock\" and \"I Nearly Married a Human\", the latter featuring Numan's first use of a primitive drum machine; it made an appearance the following year in Carl Sagan's TV series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.\n\nLegacy\nReplicas' synthesizer sound and occasionally nihilistic lyrics had a major impact on the industrial acts that came to prominence in the mid-nineties such as Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails, each of whom have covered Numan's songs on record. Both Manson and Foo Fighters released versions of \"Down in the Park\" whilst \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" has been covered by a number of artists and was most notably the basis for Sugababes' number one hit \"Freak Like Me\" in 2002. Numan has continued to play tracks from Replicas on his live tours, with \"Me! I Disconnect from You\", \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" and \"Down in the Park\" being mainstays, whilst \"Praying to the Aliens\" and \"Replicas\" have also lately become part of his live repertoire.\n\nOf the bonus tracks released on CD, \"Do You Need the Service?\" and \"We Are So Fragile\" were B-sides on the vinyl singles \"Down In The Park\" and \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\", respectively. \"I Nearly Married a Human (2)\" was an additional B-side on the \"Down in the Park\" 12-inch; and \"The Crazies\", \"Only a Downstat\" and \"We Have a Technical\" were outtakes from the Replicas sessions first released on vinyl in 1985. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tubeway+Army/Replicas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
