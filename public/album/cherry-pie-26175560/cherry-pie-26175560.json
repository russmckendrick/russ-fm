      "biography": "Warrant are a glam metal band from Los Angeles, California that enjoyed its greatest success in 1990 with the album 'Cherry Pie'. Spearheaded by frontman Jani Lane, the band's brand of metal was often loud, cheesy, sex-obsessed, and usually delivered with a mischievous sense of humor. The generally lighthearted band became known for raucous party anthems (such as \"Down Boys\" and \"Cherry Pie\") but also featured a versatility producing sentimental, melodic power ballads (such as \"Bed of Roses\", \"Heaven\", and \"I Saw Red\").\n\nFormed in 1984, the group endured several line-up changes and soul-searching before coalescing around vocalist Jani Lane, guitarist Erik Turner, guitarist Joey Allen, bassist Jerry Dixon, and drummer Steven Sweet. In January 1988, Warrant signed a contract with Columbia Records. They then released their debut album, which they titled 'Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich'. Although coming in at the tail end of the 80s pop metal boom, their tuneful rock brought them some critical and commercial acclaim, the album reaching the #10 slot on the Billboard 200 top albums chart.\n\nThe band's second record, 'Cherry Pie', was released in March 1990, and spawned the hits \"Cherry Pie\", \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", and \"I Saw Red\". It reached the Top Ten in the United States, and went on to sell over three million copies. The group found the title song, written by the band under studio pressure with the lyrics literally composed on a pizza box, a 'throw-away' type tune, giving them a commercial breakthrough. Yet their other tracks showed a desire to branch out into diverse subject matter and styles. For example, their southern rock inspired track \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" alludes to the famous 1852 novel on racial divisions and features lyrics discussing shocking, covered-up murders while power ballad \"Bed of Roses\" discusses a romance beset by poverty and struggles reminiscent of Bon Jovi's \"Livin' on a Prayer\".\n\nThrough riding high after their multi-platinum success and passionate touring, the band found itself in the middle of the rise of alternative music in the early 90s. In 1992, Warrant released 'Dog Eat Dog'. The record, an attempt by the band to evolve in the face of changing musical trends, received some critical acclaim but achieved only moderate commercial success. Single \"Machine Gun\", the title alone showing the change in direction, still managed to reach the top 40 rock charts. \n\nAfter this, the band would begin a long string of member changes, including even singer Jani Lane leaving the band briefly. Lane achieved some small success producing work without the group, doing some covers of other hard rock and metal bands. He would then return before the band released 'Ultraphobic' in 1995 and 'Belly to Belly, Vol. 1' in 1998. These were released on a smaller label and featured a new darker sound. Neither album would remotely come close to the success of the earlier albums. A live album and an album of re-recorded classic tracks as well as an all-covers disc, titled 'Under the Influence', followed these.\n\nJani Lane would once again leave the band in 2004. Ironically, all the other original members would return to the band the same year. Vocalist Jaime St. James, known for serving as the frontman of Black 'n Blue, would take over as singer. In 2006, Warrant released 'Born Again', which was their first album to not have Lane on vocals.\n\nOn March 4, 2008, Warrant announced that Lane had returned to the band.  Lane toured with the band through 2008, but he left the band once again soon after. On August 11, 2011, Lane was found dead in a hotel room in Woodland Hills, California. He was 47, and condolences poured in from hard rock fans.\nThere is another band with the same name:\n\n2) Warrant is, secondly, the name of an 80s-era Speed Metal band from Germany. This Warrant was formed in 1983 in Düsseldorf and has featured an aggressive heavy metal sound akin to contemporaries Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. The band's original line-up was Jörg Juraschek (vocals and bass), Thomas Klein (guitar) and Lothar Wieners (drums). Oliver May (guitar) followed shortly afterwards.\n\nIn early 1985, Warrant released the EP 'First Strike', and they soon also released 'The Enforcer'. They went on tour with Warlock later that year. The band sadly split up not too long later, with Juraschek and May going on to form Punchline while Wieners formed Monroxe.\n\nIn 1999, the band (with Jörg and Oliver) briefly reunited and recorded two new songs. Both of Warrant's albums were reissued on a single disc in 2000, with those new tracks included. In 2010, 'First Strike' and 'The Enforcer' were re-released, this meaning new artwork as well as the inclusion of some some live recordings.\n\nThe band also notably performed several live shows with Necronomicon and starred in some music festivals. In August 2010, they signed a deal with PSR. Fans rejoiced as the group had new life breathed into it. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Warrant\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Cherry Pie is the second music album by American Glam metal band Warrant. The record—which spawned the hits \"Cherry Pie\", \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", and \"I Saw Red\"—is the band's best-known and highest-selling release.\n\nCherry Pie was released on September 11, 1990 through CBS Records. Like its predecessor, Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich, it was recorded at The Enterprise in Burbank, California.\n\nIt is widely rumored that Erik Turner and Joey Allen had not played a note on the album and that all guitar work had been performed by ex-Streets guitarist and session musician Mike Slamer. The rumor has never been verified, although Slamer's wife confirmed in 1998 that her husband played guitar on the record. The album's liner notes refer to Turner's function as \"G-string\" and Allen's as \"Bong Riffs\", adding that \"Erik & Joey would like to thank Mike Slamer & Tommy Girvin for their Wielding G string Inspirations\".\n\nSlamer was joined by numerous other guest performers; the record also features contributions from Jani Lane's brother Erik Oswald, guitarist C. C. DeVille from Poison, guitarist and bassist Bruno Ravel and drummer Steve West from Danger Danger, and singer Fiona.\n\nThe album carried a parental advisory sticker in the United States, due to the final track entitled \"Ode to Tipper Gore\", which consisted of a collection of swear words cut from the band's live performances. A \"clean\" version of the album also existed, with the final track removed, and an audible \"bleep\" of a curse in a previous song.\n\nCanadian cable-TV music network, MuchMusic, refused to air the \"Cherry Pie\" video on the grounds that it was \"offensively sexist\".\n\nThe albums themes include sex (\"Cherry Pie\", \"Sure Feels Good to Me\", \"Love in Stereo\"), love and devotion (\"Mr. Rainmaker\", \"Blind Faith\"), and betrayal (\"I Saw Red\", \"Train, Train\"). The song \"Train, Train\" is a cover version of a song originally performed by the band Blackfoot on their 1979 album Strikes.\n\n\"Cherry Pie\", which is probably Warrant's best-known song, was dedicated to president of Sony Music Entertainment US Don Ienner. The dedication was no doubt inspired by the record company pressure which led to the track's creation. The record was completed without the song, but Warrant's label requested that a new rock \"anthem\" be added in order to enhance its marketability. Vocalist Lane responded by writing \"Cherry Pie\" in 15 minutes. Bassist Jerry Dixon and guitarist Allen, who believed the album was complete and were playing in a charity golf tournament in Denver, were called back to Los Angeles to complete the track. The single comprises a string of metaphorical references to sex and bears a striking resemblance to Def Leppard's \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", and Joan Jett's \"I Love Rock n' Roll\". The Guitar solo was performed by Poison's guitarist C. C. DeVille.\n\nPrior to the writing of \"Cherry Pie\", the album's title and first single was to have been \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", a track which foreshadowed the kind of imaginative song writing which would later be more fully revealed on the Dog Eat Dog record. Although named after the classic novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, the song tells the story of a witness to the involvement of local police in a double murder and appeared to have nothing to do with slavery, racism, or the Deep South (although the video for the song was set in Louisiana). It was eventually released as a single and reached #83 on the American charts.\n\nThe record's third single was \"I Saw Red\", a power ballad inspired by a true story of betrayal. It was written after Lane had walked in on his best friend in bed with his girlfriend, resulting in his nervous breakdown and the delayed release of the band's first record Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich. When it was released as a single, it reached #10 on the American charts, becoming their second Top 10 single.\n\nThe song \"Cherry Pie\" from this album is featured in the video game Guitar Hero II. It is also featured as Nancy's ring tone in King of the Hill, in an ad for XM radio, and in the twelfth episode of the animated series Mission Hill. On May 1, 2007, \"Cherry Pie\" was featured on ECW's Extreme Expose. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Warrant/Cherry+Pie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
