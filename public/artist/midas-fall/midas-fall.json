  "biography": "Described by Subba Cultcha Magazine as \"chiming vocal-led post-rock\", Edinburgh-based duo Midas Fall have spent the last three years carving a unique sound, combining elements of electronica, post-rock and alt-goth to create \"...powerful yet fragile, devastatingly beautiful and beautifully devastating...\" music (The Founder Magazine). \n\nMidas Fall will release their second album 'Wilderness' on eclectic indie label Monotreme Records on April 2nd 2013 and will tour to support the album later in the year. \n\n2012 saw the band perform at Switzerland's Deadline Festival, share the stage with labelmates 65daysofstatic and Reigns in London at the Monotreme Records 10th Birthday party, perform headline slots in London and Budapest, support We Were Promised Jetpacks and December will see the band support Her Name Is Calla in York, London and Leicester. \n\n2011 saw Midas Fall complete their first European tour, including a slot at Belgium's Dunk! Festival, sold-out shows in Athens, Sofia, Glasgow, Manchester and London, play Germany's Dark Spring Festival, support label-mates Jeniferever and Kerrang! favourites Hawk Eyes and perform on the main stage at GoGo Festival. 2011 also saw the band secure endorsements from JHS Hornby (Fret King Guitars), Diago, DiPinto Guitars, Dava Picks and Lion Cajon Drums. \n\nTheir debut album 'Eleven. Return and Revert' had its worldwide release with Monotreme in April 2010. Garnering numerous glowing reviews comparing them to the likes of Portishead and Explosions in the Sky.\n \nMidas Fall have previously supported Japanese post-rockers Mono and secured a coveted synch for their track 'MovieScreens' on BBC3's Lip Service soundtrack - a soundtrack which charted in the UK's top 20 and has since been released in Canada and Australia, increasing the bands overseas following. \n\n2009 saw the group self release debut EP 'Century' and gain national airplay from (amongst others) BBC Introducing's Tom Robinson and the Best of Myspace podcast.\nwww.midasfall.com\nhttp://facebook.com/midasfall\nhttp://twitter.com/midasfall\n\nContact:\n\ninfo@midasfall.com\ninfo@monotremerecords.com\n \nwww.monotremerecords.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Midas+Fall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
