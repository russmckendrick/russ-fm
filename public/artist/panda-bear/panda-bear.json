  "biography": "Noah Benjamin Lennox (born July 17, 1978 in Baltimore, Maryland) also known as Panda Bear, is an experimental musician and a founding member of Animal Collective, currently based in Lisbon, Portugal. He was a featured artist on the track \"Doin' It Right\" on Daft Punk's album Random Access Memories, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2014.\nLennox's debut album Panda Bear was released in 1999 on Soccer Star Records. After focusing more on touring and recording with Animal Collective, he released the follow-up Young Prayer in 2004 and the highly acclaimed third solo album Person Pitch in 2007. Of his songwriting style, Lennox says \"I get impatient writing songs, I can't spend more than a couple of hours before I get frustrated. So I got to kind of spit it out real fast. My favorite songs are the ones where I worked really really fast on, when it comes all out in like two hours or something.\"\n\nLennox's fourth album Tomboy was due to be released \"near the end of 2010\". He started performing material from Tomboy on December 5, 2008 at a show with No Age in Miami, FL. During a brief European tour in January 2010, he played three shows consisting almost entirely of new material. On March 7, 2010, a tour setlist with titles for ten of the new songs was posted on Panda Bear's MySpace blog. Panda Bear has also played Primavera Sound Festival in 2010. The single \"Tomboy\" and the b-side \"Slow Motion\" were released in July 2010. It was announced in August that singles \"You Can Count on Me\" and \"Alsatian Darn\" would be released via Domino on September 28. The limited 500 copies of \"You Can Count On Me\" sold out in less than a day. The single \"Last Night at the Jetty\" was released December 2010. The single \"Surfer's Hymn\" was released March 28, 2011. Panda Bear's fourth album \"Tomboy\" was released April 12, 2011 on his own label, Paw Tracks.\n\nHis song \"Comfy In Nautica\" appears in ABC's 2010 global warming movie Earth 2100\n\nLennox was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he planned to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England. However, Lennox was unable to play when the event was rescheduled to March 2012.\n\nJune 2013, Panda Bear performed a set of all new material at ATP. The new record is tentatively titled \"Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper\".",

      "biography_en": "Noah Benjamin Lennox (born July 17, 1978 in Baltimore, Maryland) also known as Panda Bear, is an experimental musician and a founding member of Animal Collective, currently based in Lisbon, Portugal. He was a featured artist on the track \"Doin' It Right\" on Daft Punk's album Random Access Memories, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2014.\nLennox's debut album Panda Bear was released in 1999 on Soccer Star Records. After focusing more on touring and recording with Animal Collective, he released the follow-up Young Prayer in 2004 and the highly acclaimed third solo album Person Pitch in 2007. Of his songwriting style, Lennox says \"I get impatient writing songs, I can't spend more than a couple of hours before I get frustrated. So I got to kind of spit it out real fast. My favorite songs are the ones where I worked really really fast on, when it comes all out in like two hours or something.\"\n\nLennox's fourth album Tomboy was due to be released \"near the end of 2010\". He started performing material from Tomboy on December 5, 2008 at a show with No Age in Miami, FL. During a brief European tour in January 2010, he played three shows consisting almost entirely of new material. On March 7, 2010, a tour setlist with titles for ten of the new songs was posted on Panda Bear's MySpace blog. Panda Bear has also played Primavera Sound Festival in 2010. The single \"Tomboy\" and the b-side \"Slow Motion\" were released in July 2010. It was announced in August that singles \"You Can Count on Me\" and \"Alsatian Darn\" would be released via Domino on September 28. The limited 500 copies of \"You Can Count On Me\" sold out in less than a day. The single \"Last Night at the Jetty\" was released December 2010. The single \"Surfer's Hymn\" was released March 28, 2011. Panda Bear's fourth album \"Tomboy\" was released April 12, 2011 on his own label, Paw Tracks.\n\nHis song \"Comfy In Nautica\" appears in ABC's 2010 global warming movie Earth 2100\n\nLennox was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he planned to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England. However, Lennox was unable to play when the event was rescheduled to March 2012.\n\nJune 2013, Panda Bear performed a set of all new material at ATP. The new record is tentatively titled \"Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper\".",

      "biography_en": "Noah Benjamin Lennox (born July 17, 1978 in Baltimore, Maryland) also known as Panda Bear, is an experimental musician and a founding member of Animal Collective, currently based in Lisbon, Portugal. He was a featured artist on the track \"Doin' It Right\" on Daft Punk's album Random Access Memories, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2014.\nLennox's debut album Panda Bear was released in 1999 on Soccer Star Records. After focusing more on touring and recording with Animal Collective, he released the follow-up Young Prayer in 2004 and the highly acclaimed third solo album Person Pitch in 2007. Of his songwriting style, Lennox says \"I get impatient writing songs, I can't spend more than a couple of hours before I get frustrated. So I got to kind of spit it out real fast. My favorite songs are the ones where I worked really really fast on, when it comes all out in like two hours or something.\"\n\nLennox's fourth album Tomboy was due to be released \"near the end of 2010\". He started performing material from Tomboy on December 5, 2008 at a show with No Age in Miami, FL. During a brief European tour in January 2010, he played three shows consisting almost entirely of new material. On March 7, 2010, a tour setlist with titles for ten of the new songs was posted on Panda Bear's MySpace blog. Panda Bear has also played Primavera Sound Festival in 2010. The single \"Tomboy\" and the b-side \"Slow Motion\" were released in July 2010. It was announced in August that singles \"You Can Count on Me\" and \"Alsatian Darn\" would be released via Domino on September 28. The limited 500 copies of \"You Can Count On Me\" sold out in less than a day. The single \"Last Night at the Jetty\" was released December 2010. The single \"Surfer's Hymn\" was released March 28, 2011. Panda Bear's fourth album \"Tomboy\" was released April 12, 2011 on his own label, Paw Tracks.\n\nHis song \"Comfy In Nautica\" appears in ABC's 2010 global warming movie Earth 2100\n\nLennox was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he planned to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England. However, Lennox was unable to play when the event was rescheduled to March 2012.\n\nJune 2013, Panda Bear performed a set of all new material at ATP. The new record is tentatively titled \"Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper\".",
