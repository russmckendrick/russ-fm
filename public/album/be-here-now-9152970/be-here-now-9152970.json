      "biography": "Oasis are an English alternative rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as the Rain, the group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) later joined as a fifth member, finalising the group's core lineup. During the course of their existence, they had various lineup changes, with the Gallagher brothers remaining the only staple members.\n\nOasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The following year they recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with drummer Alan White, in the midst of a chart rivalry with peers Blur. Spending ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? was also an international chart success and became one of the best-selling albums of all time. In addition, it stands as the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the biggest-selling album in the UK of the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now. It became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history.\n\nOasis' popularity later declined and McGuigan and Arthurs left in 1999 as Oasis released Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). They were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist Andy Bell. White departed in 2004, replaced by Zak Starkey and later Chris Sharrock. Oasis released three more studio albums, Heathen Chemistry (2002), Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008). The group abruptly disbanded after the departure of Noel Gallagher in August 2009.\n\nAs of 2009, Oasis had sold over 70 million records worldwide. They are among the most successful acts on the UK Singles Chart and Albums Chart, with eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums. The band also achieved three platinum albums in the US. They won 17 NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for Outstanding Contribution to Music and one for the \"Best Album of the Last 30 Years\" for (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. They were nominated for two Grammy Awards.\n\nOn 27th August 2024, the Gallagher brothers confirmed Oasis would reunite for a series of concerts across the United Kingdom and Ireland in summer 2025.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nDefinitely Maybe (1994)\n(What's the Story) Morning Glory?

      "editorial_notes": "The gargantuan success of Oasis’s second album, <i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?</i>, might have made its 1997 follow-up one of the most feverishly anticipated records of the ’90s, but chief songwriter, guitarist and sometime-singer Noel Gallagher wasn’t exactly cowed by the challenge. Instead, he set out to make a grandiose rock ’n’ roll record befitting of the Manchester five-piece’s new status. It had been a rapid elevation: Just three years after the release of their game-changing debut <i>Definitely Maybe</i>, Oasis were now one of the world’s biggest bands.\n\nNo wonder the group felt like they’d earned the right to think big. A few months before sessions began in October 1996 at London’s Abbey Road Studios, a choice of location that hammered home how keen Oasis were to cement their reputation as The Beatles’ rightful heirs, Oasis had played two era-defining, record-breaking gigs at Knebworth House in Hertfordshire. They were on top of the world, and there was zero chance that they were going to follow up such monumental highs with a record that stripped things back. <i>Be Here Now</i> was all about making their sound bigger and more bombastic, aiming for anthems fit for the sort of band who played to 250,000 people in one weekend.\n\nThe songs had come together a few months before that epochal summer. During some time off in Mustique, holed up in Mick Jagger’s pad, Noel was determined to work his way out of a period of writer’s block. He hit his stride to the point that <i>…Morning Glory?</i> producer Owen Morris joined him after two weeks, and the two laid down a series of demos with Noel playing all the instruments.\n\nThe band would use those versions as a template while getting down to work in Abbey Road and then Surrey’s Ridge Farm Studio, where they decamped in order to escape the media attention they’d attracted at Abbey Road. The tabloids weren’t their only issue though: Recording sessions were clouded by rampant drug use, with a cocaine-addled Noel reaching a conclusion that everything needed to be as epic and colossal as possible. These were productions impossible to see to the bottom of, with a seemingly infinite layer of guitar overdubs coated over everything.\n\nLuckily, Noel’s sense of melodicism had not abandoned him. There are some songs on <i>Be Here Now</i> that might not have stood up on <i>Definitely Maybe</i> or <i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?</i> or even on their spotless B-sides collection <i>The Masterplan</i>—tracks never revisited by Oasis, or by Noel and his singer brother Liam in their respective solo careers. But there are also frequent moments of prime Oasis. The ballads here are some of their most sumptuous, from the orchestral sway of “Stand By Me” to the minor-chord splendour of “Don’t Go Away”, while lead single “D’You Know What I Mean?” was a moody, widescreen rocker that perfectly paired huge hooks with dynamic, deft sonics. On the rollicking title track—a glorious union of jagged guitars and surly vocals—they showed there was still no one to touch them when they clicked into gear.\n\nThe song that best summed up where Oasis were at as they made <i>Be Here Now</i>, though, was a nine-minute monster near the album’s end. “All Around the World” had been written by Noel years before, pre-dating the band signing a record deal. Here it was retooled as their most ambitious cut yet, its tuneful, Beatles-y hook growing ever more potent with each key change, a surging string section lifting it skyward.\n\nWere Oasis put on this earth to deliver nine-minute ’60s pop psychedelia? Possibly not, but as a snapshot of a band working out where to go when you’ve reached the top, <i>Be Here Now</i> remains an enthralling, sometimes brilliant listen. Its success confirmed what everyone knew, especially the band themselves: This juggernaut was unstoppable. It became the fastest-selling album in British history and the biggest of 1997, while its entry at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart underlined the inroads they’d made on the other side of the Atlantic. But its success couldn’t mask the unease Noel Gallagher soon felt about his band’s third album. Next would come a rethink and a change in line-up. The first era of Oasis—the one where they took over the world—was coming to a close.",

          "short": "What do you do once you’ve become Britain’s biggest band? Think bigger.",
          "standard": "The gargantuan success of Oasis’s second album, <i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?</i>, might have made its 1997 follow-up one of the most feverishly anticipated records of the ’90s, but chief songwriter, guitarist and sometime-singer Noel Gallagher wasn’t exactly cowed by the challenge. Instead, he set out to make a grandiose rock ’n’ roll record befitting of the Manchester five-piece’s new status. It had been a rapid elevation: Just three years after the release of their game-changing debut <i>Definitely Maybe</i>, Oasis were now one of the world’s biggest bands.\n\nNo wonder the group felt like they’d earned the right to think big. A few months before sessions began in October 1996 at London’s Abbey Road Studios, a choice of location that hammered home how keen Oasis were to cement their reputation as The Beatles’ rightful heirs, Oasis had played two era-defining, record-breaking gigs at Knebworth House in Hertfordshire. They were on top of the world, and there was zero chance that they were going to follow up such monumental highs with a record that stripped things back. <i>Be Here Now</i> was all about making their sound bigger and more bombastic, aiming for anthems fit for the sort of band who played to 250,000 people in one weekend.\n\nThe songs had come together a few months before that epochal summer. During some time off in Mustique, holed up in Mick Jagger’s pad, Noel was determined to work his way out of a period of writer’s block. He hit his stride to the point that <i>…Morning Glory?</i> producer Owen Morris joined him after two weeks, and the two laid down a series of demos with Noel playing all the instruments.\n\nThe band would use those versions as a template while getting down to work in Abbey Road and then Surrey’s Ridge Farm Studio, where they decamped in order to escape the media attention they’d attracted at Abbey Road. The tabloids weren’t their only issue though: Recording sessions were clouded by rampant drug use, with a cocaine-addled Noel reaching a conclusion that everything needed to be as epic and colossal as possible. These were productions impossible to see to the bottom of, with a seemingly infinite layer of guitar overdubs coated over everything.\n\nLuckily, Noel’s sense of melodicism had not abandoned him. There are some songs on <i>Be Here Now</i> that might not have stood up on <i>Definitely Maybe</i> or <i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?</i> or even on their spotless B-sides collection <i>The Masterplan</i>—tracks never revisited by Oasis, or by Noel and his singer brother Liam in their respective solo careers. But there are also frequent moments of prime Oasis. The ballads here are some of their most sumptuous, from the orchestral sway of “Stand By Me” to the minor-chord splendour of “Don’t Go Away”, while lead single “D’You Know What I Mean?” was a moody, widescreen rocker that perfectly paired huge hooks with dynamic, deft sonics. On the rollicking title track—a glorious union of jagged guitars and surly vocals—they showed there was still no one to touch them when they clicked into gear.\n\nThe song that best summed up where Oasis were at as they made <i>Be Here Now</i>, though, was a nine-minute monster near the album’s end. “All Around the World” had been written by Noel years before, pre-dating the band signing a record deal. Here it was retooled as their most ambitious cut yet, its tuneful, Beatles-y hook growing ever more potent with each key change, a surging string section lifting it skyward.\n\nWere Oasis put on this earth to deliver nine-minute ’60s pop psychedelia? Possibly not, but as a snapshot of a band working out where to go when you’ve reached the top, <i>Be Here Now</i> remains an enthralling, sometimes brilliant listen. Its success confirmed what everyone knew, especially the band themselves: This juggernaut was unstoppable. It became the fastest-selling album in British history and the biggest of 1997, while its entry at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart underlined the inroads they’d made on the other side of the Atlantic. But its success couldn’t mask the unease Noel Gallagher soon felt about his band’s third album. Next would come a rethink and a change in line-up. The first era of Oasis—the one where they took over the world—was coming to a close."
