  "biography": "Tina Turner (born Anna Mae Bullock; November 26, 1939 – May 24, 2023) was an American-born Swiss singer, songwriter, and actress. She gained initial recognition as the lead vocalist of the musical duo Ike & Tina Turner, which became known for its energetic live performances and a series of hit songs. The duo disbanded following their divorce in 1976.\n\nFollowing the end of the partnership, Turner launched a solo career and achieved significant commercial success. In 1984, she released the album \"Private Dancer\", which marked a turning point in her career. The album included the single \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became her only number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Other notable songs from her solo career include \"Let's Stay Together\", \"Better Be Good to Me\", \"Private Dancer\", \"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\", \"It's Only Love\", \"Typical Male\", \"The Best\", \"I Don't Wanna Lose You\", \"I Don't Wanna Fight\", and \"GoldenEye\".\n\nHer Break Every Rule World Tour (1987–1988) set a Guinness World Record for the largest paying audience for a solo performer at the time, with 180,000 attendees. Turner continued to tour successfully with the Wildest Dreams Tour (1996–1997) and the Twenty Four Seven Tour (2000), the latter being the highest-grossing North American tour of that year. She retired from performing after completing the Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour in 2009.\n\nIn addition to her music career, Turner acted in several films, including \"Tommy\" (1975), \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985), and \"Last Action Hero\" (1993). Her life and career were portrayed in the 1993 film \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", based on her autobiography \"I, Tina: My Life Story\" (1986). She was also the subject of the jukebox musical \"Tina\" (2018) and the documentary film of the same name (2021).\n\nTurner received 12 Grammy Awards, including eight competitive awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame inductions. Rolling Stone magazine included her in its lists of the greatest artists and singers of all time. She was the first Black artist and the first woman to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone, and she received several other recognitions for her achievements in music and performance. Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: with Ike Turner in 1991 and as a solo artist in 2021. She also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame, as well as the Kennedy Center Honors in 2005.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Turner\n\nStudio albums\nTina Turns the Country On!
