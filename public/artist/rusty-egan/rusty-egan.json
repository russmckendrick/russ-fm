  "biography": "Rusty Egan (born 19 September 1957, London) was the drummer for the British new wave band, The Rich Kids. They were founded by former Sex Pistols, Glen Matlock, bass guitarist and backing vocals, occasional lead vocals; with Steve New guitarist and backing vocals, occasional lead vocals; and fronted by Midge Ure guitarist, lead vocals and occasional backing vocals, and keyboards player,  from their inception in March 1977 to their disbanding in December 1978. He continued working with Ure, and later collaborated with The Misfits, The Skids, Shock, and Visage. However, Egan did not return to Visage for its reunion at the end of the 1990s.\n\nHe was the DJ at Blitz, the influential New Romantic nightclub in London where he worked with Steve Strange from 1979 until 1981. Whilst there, he introduced Germany's (Kraftwerk), the Japanese (Yellow Magic Orchestra) and British (Eno, Ultravox, Landscape) electronica /synthpop to the British club scene, almost single-handedly putting together the soundtrack for the New Romantic movement. Egan also owned The Cage, a New Romantic record store on London's King's Road. As the club grew in popularity, Egan began to be recognised as a central figure in London's nightlife. In 1982, he opened up the Camden Palace nightclub in London, where he continued to spread and influence the development of electronica in the UK. For a time, he switched to producing records for many of the bands he used to DJ, including Spear of Destiny, Shock, Visage, and The Senate.\n\nEgan was later brought back into his career as a disc jockey by the allure of the internet as a medium for sharing music. Presently, he works as a DJ at the Boujis nightclub in London, playing and promoting 1980s style synthpop and electronica music.\n\nOn 13 June 2008, Egan appeared DJing at the 'Big Top', as part of the Isle of Wight Festival.\n\nEgan appeared alongside former Visage bandmate Steve Strange on makeover show Pop Goes the Band in early 2009 on Living. He had his teeth drastically reconstructed as part of his makeover.\n\nRusty won the category for lifetime achievement at the 2009 London Club and Bar Awards. Previous winners have included Richard Branson, Mark Fuller and Nick House. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rusty+Egan\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
