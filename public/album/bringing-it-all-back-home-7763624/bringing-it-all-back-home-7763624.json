      "biography": "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States)  is an American singer-songwriter. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years.\nDylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. \n\nMuch of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.\n\nHis album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.\n\nThe second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\", released in July of 1965, later being named \"The Greatest Song of All Time\" by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan's backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded All Along the Watchtower, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1974, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered Christ, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn't play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.\n\nDylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1980-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performances have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.\n\nBob Dylan's strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan's early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.\n\nDylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  \n\nNobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett.

      "editorial_notes": "The alarm bell rang two seconds into Bob Dylan’s 1965 masterpiece, <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>. Sure, the opening acoustic chord was nervy, even angular. But it was that high electric lick that sliced beneath the start of “Subterranean Homesick Blues” that signalled Dylan’s true unrest—not to mention a sea of change in his so-called folk music. For four albums, Dylan had been almost entirely alone, his heavy-handed acoustic strums and occasional piano supporting his famously nasal tone and whining harmonica. But if his champions had been disappointed by the singer’s turn from politics to the personal on 1964’s <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i>, then <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>—with those Edisonised licks, walloping drums and charging band—must have indeed felt like Judas’ betrayal of Jesus.\n\nStill, the album’s electrified first half is one of rock ’n’ roll’s great gambits, condensing tales of urban excitement, bohemian beauty, socialist resistance, racial protest and even an alternate history of the United States into little more than 20 minutes. “Outlaw Blues” is an escapist outburst, pounding ahead like a No Wave premonition, while “She Belongs to Me” reigns as one of folk-rock’s first true gems. And for anyone who demanded that Dylan forever remain in <i>Freewheelin’</i> mode, there was “Maggie’s Farm”, an assault on capitalist cruelty that doubled as an unfond farewell to anyone holding you against your will—like, say, folkies of a certain vintage.\n\nThe band stepped away for the four songs of the second half, but it somehow felt no less electric. “Mr. Tambourine Man” is an anthem of generational liberation, aimed at those “ready for to fade/into my own parade”. And Dylan’s consecutive and consummate epics, “Gates of Eden” and “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)”, are poetic fever dreams, the swirling imagery of the former giving way to the heady and ceaseless aphorisms (“He not busy being born is busy dying”) of the latter. Dylan—and for that matter, much of rock ’n’ roll, punk included—would rarely sound so aggressive. And as soft landings go, “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue” arrives as a slap in the face, a love-me-or-leave-me edict for anyone who doubted Dylan’s new direction.\n\nThere’s a common conception that Dylan left political songwriting behind on <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i>, a move affirmed by <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>. But even apart from radical screeds like “Maggie’s Farm” or the stunning and playful “Bob Dylan’s 115th Dream”, these 11 songs are acts of radical freedom—of taking convention not as a direction but as a challenge. In many ways, <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i> is Dylan’s most political work, putting the ideas of his past to use in his own work.",

On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll band - a move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk song community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"), as his lyrics continued their trend toward the abstract and personal.\n\nBringing It All Back Home is often cited as the birth of folk rock, and one of the peak albums of Dylan's career.\n\nThe album reached #6 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan's LPs to break into the US top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that Spring. The lead-off track, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"), as his lyrics continued their trend toward the abstract and personal.\n\nBringing It All Back Home is often cited as the birth of folk rock, and one of the peak albums of Dylan's career.\n\nThe album reached #6 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan's LPs to break into the US top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that Spring. The lead-off track, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
