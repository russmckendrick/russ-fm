      "biography": "CHVRCHES (pronounced as \"churches\"; stylised as CHVRCHΞS) are a Scottish electronic band from Glasgow, formed in 2011. The group consists of Lauren Mayberry (lead vocals, occasionally synths and samplers), Iain Cook (synths, guitar, bass, vocals) and Martin Doherty (synths, samplers, vocals). The group's debut album, The Bones of What You Believe, was released on 20 September 2013.\n\nPreviously, Mayberry was a member of the bands Boyfriend/Girlfriend and Blue Sky Archives. Mayberry is a trained drummer and also did a four-year law degree, followed by a Masters in journalism. Cook was a member of Aereogramme and The Unwinding Hours and also wrote music for film and TV. Doherty was a live member of The Twilight Sad. According to Mayberry, \"Iain and Martin went to university together so they've known each other for quite a long time\".\n\nThe band started in October 2011 as a studio project between the long time friends Iain Cook and Martin Doherty. Cook already knew Lauren Mayberry from working with Blue Sky Archives and suggested her as a potential vocalist for the project.\n\nCHVRCHES were influenced by acts such as Prince, Tubeway Army, Robyn, Depeche Mode, Kate Bush, Cocteau Twins, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Laurie Anderson. The band write, record, mix and master everything in a basement studio in Glasgow.\n\nIn May 2012, they released the song \"Lies\". In the same year, CHVRCHES toured with Passion Pit, as the opening band for their concerts and also toured on their own. \"Lies\" ranked at number 28 on NME's Best Tracks of 2012. CHVRCHES also came fifth on the BBC's Sound of 2013 list.\n\nOn 25 March 2013, they released Recover EP. They performed at SXSW and won the Inaugural Grulke Prize (for Developing Non-US Act).

Looking back on what we’ve achieved together, so much of it doesn’t feel real or even possible. [...] I am so proud of all the chapters our band has been able to have and I am so grateful to my bandmates for taking me on that journey with them.\n\nShe also clarified that the band was \"confident that the Chvrches story has many more pages yet to be written.”[93]\n\nIn August, she announced that her first solo single \"Are You Awake?\" would release on September 1.[94]\n\nOn 16 August 2023, Chvrches announced that a 10th anniversary special edition of The Bones of What You Believe was planned for release on October 13 of the same year.
