  "biography": "Simbiatu \"Simbi\" Abisola Abiola Ajikawo, better known by her stage name Little Simz, is a British rapper, singer and actress. She rose to prominence with the independent release of her first three albums, namely A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons (2015), Stillness in Wonderland (2016) and Grey Area (2019), the latter of which was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize and won the awards for Best Album at both the Ivor Novello Awards and the NME Awards. Her fourth album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert (2021) received widespread critical acclaim, with several publications deeming it the best album of 2021. It also earned her the 2022 Brit Award for Best New Artist and the Libera Award for Best Hip-Hop/Rap Record. \n\nShe describes her music as rap and experimental. Whilst she is closely affiliated with the grime genre, she has also pulled inspiration from other genres including reggae, blues, synth-rock and jazzy R&B.\n\nSimz has performed alongside Estelle, Tinie Tempah, Ms. Dynamite and Kano.\n\nSimz has performed at Rising Tide, iluvlive, Industry Takeover (Urban Development) Hackney Empire, Somerset House and the House of Lords. She also performed at the BBC 1Xtra Prom 2015 at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside a full orchestra led by Jules Buckley.\n\nSimz can be heard on the Leave to Remain film soundtrack, performing the song \"Leave It As That\". In early 2013, she appeared on BBC Radio 1Xtra to discuss her performance at the Hackney Weekend.\n\nSimz then went on to do a Maida Vale session for Huw Stephens, and has since gone on to receive critical acclaim from the likes of Zane Lowe, Dizzee Rascal and Revolt TV. She also has received praise from Kendrick Lamar.\n\nOn 16 December 2016 she released her second studio album  Stillness in Wonderland. It was inspired by Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and supported by a comic book, art exhibition and festival.\n\nIn 2017, she performed as the opening act for Gorillaz during their Humanz Tour, and was the vocalist for the song \"Garage Palace\", featured on the Super Deluxe edition of their album Humanz.\n\nSimz has resisted signing to a label, instead release her music through her own Age 101 records. On 6 September 2018, Simz and her label AGE 101 signed a worldwide deal with AWAL Recordings, after AWAL had distributed her debut album \"A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons\" in 2015. This deal was renewed on 18 June 2020.\n\nHer 2019 studio album Grey Area was released to widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the Mercury Prize, and IMPALA's European Independent Album of the Year Award (2019).\n\nOn 3 September 2021, she released her fourth studio album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert debuting at number 4 on the UK album charts and winning BBC 6's Album of the Year. It was quickly followed by No Thank You, her 5th studio album, released on December 12, 2022 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Simz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
