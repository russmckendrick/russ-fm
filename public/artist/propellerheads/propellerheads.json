  "biography": "Propellerheads were a British big beat music band formed in 1995 in Bath, consisting of electronic producers Will White and Alex Gifford. The name \"Propellerhead\" is Californian slang for a computer nerd, which the band members found fitting after hearing it from a friend.\n\nTheir first release was an EP titled \"Dive!\" in 1996 on the independent label Wall of Sound. They gained recognition in 1997 by contributing a remix for David Arnold’s Bond tribute album \"Shaken & Stirred,\" covering John Barry’s \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\" the theme from the sixth James Bond film, re-orchestrated by Arnold. Following this, they released the single \"History Repeating,\" a collaboration with jazz singer Shirley Bassey, blending big beat and jazz elements.\n\nTheir only album, \"Decksandrumsandrockandroll,\" was released in 1998 by Wall of Sound in the UK and Europe, and by DreamWorks in the US and Japan. The DreamWorks version included collaborations with hip hop groups De La Soul and Jungle Brothers, while the Japanese edition featured a two-disc special edition with some of their earlier singles. The track \"Spybreak!\" from the album became well-known after being used in the lobby scene of the film \"The Matrix.\"\n\nAfter touring in support of their album, Will White became ill. The band released the \"Extended Play E.P.\" in 1998, which included the track \"Props' Vote Of Gratitude,\" featuring Alex Gifford rapping for the first time and hinting at a return after a break. However, the band became inactive after this period. Alex Gifford moved to New York and produced the Jungle Brothers' 1999 album \"V.I.P.,\" where he also performed vocals alongside The Black Eyed Peas. Will White contributed drums to the title track. Gifford also produced a track for Rufus Wainwright’s 2001 album \"Poses.\" White has released a mix compilation for the Beatz and Bobz series and has appeared as part of the De-Fex music project.\n\nIn October 2003, Wall of Sound celebrated its tenth anniversary with a two-disc compilation album. The first disc featured artists such as Röyksopp, The Wiseguys, and Mekon, while Gifford provided a mix CD for the second disc. The opening track on this disc was a new Propellerheads song featuring British rapper Livingroom Johnston, titled \"10 Years.\" Shortly after this release, the band disbanded.\n\nThe song \"Take California\" by Propellerheads was the first track to be used in an Apple iPod television advertisement.\n\nWill White was also involved in the live version of Long Range, a now-defunct project by Phil Hartnoll of Orbital. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Propellerheads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
