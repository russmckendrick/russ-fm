  "biography": "Horslips is an Irish Celtic rock band that compose, arrange and perform songs frequently inspired by traditional Irish airs, jigs and reels. Regarded as 'founding fathers' of Celtic rock for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music, the band went on to inspire many local and international acts. Formed in Dublin in 1970, the band went on an extended hiatus in 1980. The band reformed for two Irish shows (the Odyssey Arena in Belfast and the 3Arena in Dublin) at the end of 2009, and have continued to play shows since then.\n\nBand members\n\n    * Jim Lockhart, from Francis St in Dublin, studied classical music at Trinity College Dublin. He fell under the influence of Sean Ã“ Riada, wanting to build an orchestral sound out of Irish music. He played keyboards, pipes, whistles and flute. He did vocals on a select number of songs, mainly in Manx or Irish.\n\n    * Eamon Carr is from Kells, County Meath. He started a quarterly literary magazine called The Tara Telephone in Dublin in the late 60s that also ran poetry recitals. He was the drummer.\n\n    * Charles O'Connor, from Middlesbrough in the UK played concertina, mandolin, and fiddle (later on he played the electric guitar) and shared the main vocal tasks with Barry Devlin and Johnny Fean.\n\n    * Barry Devlin, from Ardboe in County Tyrone once trained as a Franciscan priest. He left this to do English in UCD and then after joined a graphics company as a screenwriter. He was the band's bass player, shared vocals and its unofficial front man.\n\n    * Johnny Fean was born in Dublin in 1951 and spent his childhood in the city of Limerick. He soon mastered guitar, banjo, mandolin and harmonica. In his teens, he played in sessions in Limerick and County Clare. He developed his listening tastes from rock to blues and incorporated it into his guitar style. In his late teens he played in a group called \"Sweet Street,\" with Joe O'Donnell on electric fiddle and Eugene Wallace. He later played in \"Jeremiah Henry,\" a rock and blues band. His idols were Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. He left \"Jeremiah Henry\" in 1970 to play traditional music again in Limerick.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Horslips\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Outlet reissued all the albums on vinyl, cassette and eventually CD over the following years. The original CD reissues, released in conjunction with [l=Homespun Records], are direct transfers (no mention of remastering on the covers). Later Outlet reissues were remastered and included improved artwork. In 1999, Horslips won a lengthy legal battle with Outlet, regaining the rights to their back catalogue. A new remastering program was launched and the first official CD remasters came out on [l=Edsel Records] in 2000. All subsequent CD issues are official remasters with improved sound quality and packaging.\r\n",

Outlet reissued all the albums on vinyl, cassette and eventually CD over the following years. The original CD reissues, released in conjunction with [l=Homespun Records], are direct transfers (no mention of remastering on the covers). Later Outlet reissues were remastered and included improved artwork. In 1999, Horslips won a lengthy legal battle with Outlet, regaining the rights to their back catalogue. A new remastering program was launched and the first official CD remasters came out on [l=Edsel Records] in 2000. All subsequent CD issues are official remasters with improved sound quality and packaging.\r\n",

      "bio_content": "Horslips is an Irish Celtic rock band that compose, arrange and perform songs frequently inspired by traditional Irish airs, jigs and reels. Regarded as 'founding fathers' of Celtic rock for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music, the band went on to inspire many local and international acts. Formed in Dublin in 1970, the band went on an extended hiatus in 1980. The band reformed for two Irish shows (the Odyssey Arena in Belfast and the 3Arena in Dublin) at the end of 2009, and have continued to play shows since then.\n\nBand members\n\n    * Jim Lockhart, from Francis St in Dublin, studied classical music at Trinity College Dublin. He fell under the influence of Sean Ã“ Riada, wanting to build an orchestral sound out of Irish music. He played keyboards, pipes, whistles and flute. He did vocals on a select number of songs, mainly in Manx or Irish.\n\n    * Eamon Carr is from Kells, County Meath. He started a quarterly literary magazine called The Tara Telephone in Dublin in the late 60s that also ran poetry recitals. He was the drummer.\n\n    * Charles O'Connor, from Middlesbrough in the UK played concertina, mandolin, and fiddle (later on he played the electric guitar) and shared the main vocal tasks with Barry Devlin and Johnny Fean.\n\n    * Barry Devlin, from Ardboe in County Tyrone once trained as a Franciscan priest. He left this to do English in UCD and then after joined a graphics company as a screenwriter. He was the band's bass player, shared vocals and its unofficial front man.\n\n    * Johnny Fean was born in Dublin in 1951 and spent his childhood in the city of Limerick. He soon mastered guitar, banjo, mandolin and harmonica. In his teens, he played in sessions in Limerick and County Clare. He developed his listening tastes from rock to blues and incorporated it into his guitar style. In his late teens he played in a group called \"Sweet Street,\" with Joe O'Donnell on electric fiddle and Eugene Wallace. He later played in \"Jeremiah Henry,\" a rock and blues band. His idols were Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. He left \"Jeremiah Henry\" in 1970 to play traditional music again in Limerick.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Horslips\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
