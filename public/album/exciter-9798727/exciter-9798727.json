      "biography": "Depeche Mode are an English Synthpop band founded in 1980, originally from Basildon, Essex, United Kingdom. They are one of the most enduring and successful bands that emerged during the 80s, particularly from the new wave/new romantic era. The band name is derived from a French fashion magazine, Dépêche Mode, which means \"fashion dispatch.\" Depeche Mode are one of the most influential bands in the world, having influenced hundreds of legendary bands like Rammstein, Nine Inch Nails, Linkin Park, Paradise Lost, Marilyn Manson, and Lacuna Coil.\n\nThe band has been highly influential in the electronic dance music scene, especially synthpop, techno, and trance, partly due to their innovative work, recording techniques, and use of sampling. Their most successful album is arguably 1990's Violator, which reached the #2 position in the UK, #7 in the US, and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The band has released a long series of high-charting singles over their three-decades long career. Enjoy the Silence is their most recognized song and one of history's most covered songs.\n\nThe original line-up was Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Vince Clarke. In December 1981, Clarke left the band and later formed Yazoo, The Assembly, and Erasure. Alan Wilder joined the group initially in January 1982 as a live keyboardist but became an official member in December 1982. He left in mid-1995 to fully concentrate on his Recoil project, and the band continued as a trio. In 2010 Wilder re-joined Depeche Mode on stage after 16 years for a performance of Somebody during a show at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nDepeche Mode's origins date back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore, and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards, and Fletcher on bass. Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke, and Fletcher switched to synthesizers. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" and Depeche Mode was born. \n\nWhile playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, approached the band, who proposed a verbal contract. The result was their first single,  Dreaming of Me, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981, reaching number 57 in the UK charts and followed soon by a real contract with Mute.\n\nTo date, Depeche Mode have released:\n15 studio albums: Speak & Spell (1981), A Broken Frame (1982), Construction Time Again (1983), Some Great Reward (1984), Black Celebration (1986), Music For the Masses (1987), Violator (1990), Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993), Ultra (1997), Exciter (2001), Playing the Angel (2005),  Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013), Spirit (2017), and Memento Mori (2023);\n8 compilations: People Are People (1984), The Singles 81-85 (1985), Catching Up with Depeche Mode (1985), Greatest Hits (1987), The Singles 86>98 (1998), Remixes 81-04 (2004), The Best Of Depeche Mode Volume 1 (2006), The Complete Depeche Mode (2006);\n5 live albums: 101 (1989), Songs of Faith and Devotion Live (1993), Recording the Angel (a series of live recordings; 2006), Tour Of The Universe: Barcelona 20/21:11:09 (2009) and Live In Berlin (Soundtrack) (2014) ;\nOver 50 singles:  including Just Can't Get Enough, Everything Counts, People Are People, Master and Servant, Shake the Disease, Stripped, A Question of Time, Strangelove, Never Let Me Down Again, Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth, I Feel You, Walking in My Shoes, In Your Room, Barrel of a Gun, It's No Good, Home, Dream On, Freelove, Precious, Wrong and Heaven ;\n14 live / video collections (VHS/DVD/Blu-ray): The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg (1985), Some Great Videos (1985), Strange (1988), 101 (1989), Strange Too (1990), Devotional (1993), The Videos 86>98 (1998), One Night in Paris (2002), The Videos 86>98 (2002), Touring the Angel: Live in Milan (2006), The Best of - Volume 1 (2006), Tour of the Universe : Barcelona 20/21.11.09 (2009), Live in Berlin (2014) and Video Singles Collection (2016)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, Björk producer Mark Bell has encouraged them to experiment while maintaining their instinct for indelible hooks. Whether they’re pairing distorted beats with acoustic guitar loops (“Dream On”), stomping out sci-fi disco (“I Feel Loved”) or unfolding a lulling ballad (“When the Body Sleeps”), <i>Exciter</i> is an exquisite balance of unpredictability and warmth.",

          "standard": "Twenty years into their career, having had to repair themselves after various personal crises, Depeche Mode have no right to sound this fresh and vital. However, Björk producer Mark Bell has encouraged them to experiment while maintaining their instinct for indelible hooks. Whether they’re pairing distorted beats with acoustic guitar loops (“Dream On”), stomping out sci-fi disco (“I Feel Loved”) or unfolding a lulling ballad (“When the Body Sleeps”), <i>Exciter</i> is an exquisite balance of unpredictability and warmth."

The album marks a notable point in the band's career as it showcases a shift in musical direction, highlighting their willingness to explore new sounds while retaining their distinctive essence.\n\nReleased after a three-year hiatus, Exciter is characterized by its atmospheric and introspective quality. The album embraces a more minimalist approach, utilizing electronic textures, subtle rhythms, and lead singer Dave Gahan's emotive vocals to create an intimate and contemplative sonic landscape.\n\nThe album features tracks like \"Dream On,\" the lead single, which captures a blend of Depeche Mode's classic electronic sound with an updated feel. \"I Feel Loved\" and \"Freelove\" continue this theme while \"Goodnight Lovers\" closes the album with a reflective and poignant tone.\n\nWhile Exciter might not have achieved the same commercial success as some of Depeche Mode's earlier works, it remains a significant entry in their discography. The album's willingness to embrace experimentation and its focus on atmosphere over bombast showcase the band's evolution. The album reflects Depeche Mode's ability to evolve while staying true to their core essence. Its introspective lyrics, coupled with the band's signature sound, make it an essential chapter in their musical journey, resonating with listeners who appreciate its contemplative and textured approach to electronic music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/Exciter\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
