            "content": "Virgin Records had been pushing Oldfield to create a sequel to Tubular Bells for many years prior to his departure from the label, but Oldfield was hesitant to do so, although his penultimate album for the label, Amarok, was in several respects a conceptual sequel to his 1976 album Ommadawn.\n\nFor Tubular Bells II Oldfield enlisted the help of Tom Newman, who had helped produce the original, as well as established producer Trevor Horn (known for his work with The Buggles, Yes and Art of Noise). \"Early Stages\" which is an early version of what would become \"Sentinel\" was included as a B-side to the single version of \"Sentinel\". \"Early Stages\" has a somewhat darker mood and is from the pre-Trevor Horn development of the album, possibly showing the kind of influence that Horn had.\nTubular Bells comparisons\n\nTubular Bells II partly follows musical structures of the original Tubular Bells (1973). Themes of the original Bells are taken and then completely re-composed and played with mostly new instruments. The result is an album that has same kind of thematic variation but is still new musically. Some themes can be seen as variations of themes taken from the original Bells, while some other parts of Tubular Bells II do not have much common with the themes of the original album except their overall mood or feeling.\n\nUnlike Tubular Bells there is a recurring theme, first appearing at the end of \"Sentinel\" that reappears throughout the album, though it is most obvious at the end of \"The Bell\". Also unlike the original ending coda, \"The Sailor's Hornpipe\", \"Moonshine\" is an original composition by Oldfield.\n\nIn 1998 another sequel followed, Tubular Bells III, and in 2003 Oldfield recorded a new version of the original Tubular Bells, as Tubular Bells 2003.\n\nThe introduction of the instruments at the end of the first half of the album was done by British actor Alan Rickman, though he was only listed in the credits as \"a strolling player\". This was due to the final voice not having been picked, when the artwork was produced. The Master of Ceremonies at the premiere concert in Edinburgh, Scotland was John Gordon Sinclair.\n\nOn alternate mixes of \"The Bell\" released as single B-sides, Billy Connolly and Vivian Stanshall (the voice in the original Tubular Bells) each played the Master of Ceremonies. On two alternate language B-sides of \"The Bell\", MC Otto and MC Carlos Finally played the Master of Ceremonies in German and Spanish respectively.\nTrack titles\n\nSome of the track titles for the album were taken from Arthur C. Clarke's short stories, including \"The Sentinel\" and \"Sunjammer\". Other track titles could just be references to science-fiction or space in general; dark star and weightless for example. Dark Star is also a title of a sci-fi film by John Carpenter which was released in the same year as the original Tubular Bells, 1973.\n\nOldfield has occasionally called some of the tracks on the album by different names in interviews, such as once when he performed \"Red Dawn\" on BBC Radio 2 he called it \"Russian\". The title \"Russian\" was also later given to the equivalent piece on the re-recorded version of the original Tubular Bells, Tubular Bells 2003.\n\nTubular Bells II again uses the bent metallic tube (representing a bent tubular bell) as the focus of the album artwork. The bell is a golden colour on a dark blue background as opposed to Tubular Bells' grey/silver bell on top of a sea/skyscape. Both the photos for Tubular Bells and Tubular Bells II were produced by Trevor Key.\n\nThe album was premiered with a live performance at Edinburgh Castle on 4 September 1992 with John Gordon Sinclair as Master of Ceremonies. The North American premiere was held at Carnegie Hall in New York on 1 March 1993; a world tour then followed. Following this Oldfield did not play live for nearly five years, until the premiere of Tubular Bells III in 1998 and then his Then & Now Tour in 1999. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mike+Oldfield/Tubular+Bells+II\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
