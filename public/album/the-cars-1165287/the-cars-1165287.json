      "biography": "There is more than one artist with this name:\n\n1) The Cars are a popular American new wave/power pop band that formed in 1976, after going through several different incarnations. The band was founded in Boston, Massachusetts and were signed to Elektra Records in 1977. The band originally consisted of David Robinson (drummer), Benjamin Orr (singer/bassist), Ric Ocasek (singer/rhythm guitarist), Elliot Easton (lead guitarist), Greg Hawkes (keyboardist).\n\nDuring their career, they have released seven albums: The Cars (1978), Candy-O (1979), Panorama (1980), Shake It Up (1981), Heartbeat City (1984), Door to Door (1987) and Move Like This (2011). The first five of these albums all were certified platinum by the RIAA, and their self-titled debut was one of the best-selling albums of the 1970s, remaining on the Billboard album charts for over a year. They experienced a second wave of popularity in 1984 with the album Heartbeat City and the popular MTV staples\"You Might Think,\" \"Magic,\" and \"Drive,\" the last of which was their highest-charting single, peaking at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1985, the group released a greatest hits album, which contained \"Tonight She Comes\", a mega-hit that reached #1 on the Billboard 'Top Rock Tracks'.  However, after that peak, they vanished from the public eye and worked on solo projects, and released one final album, Door to Door, before breaking up in early 1988. \nBenjamin Orr died of pancreatic cancer in October 2000. Guitarist Elliot Easton played in a surf music group and joined a touring act called Creedence Clearwater Revisted with ex-members of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Lead vocalist Ric Ocasek married supermodel Paulina Porizkova not long after The Cars' breakup and has since become a prolific producer, working on albums by such diverse artists as Bad Brains,Weezer, Guided by Voices and No Doubt. He has also released a number of solo albums, including 2005's Nexterday. Greg Hawkes and Elliot Easton have recently teamed up with Todd Rundgren and his rhythm section as The New Cars; they have released a live album and are currently touring. Ocasek gave the band his support but otherwise is not involved.\n\nThe remaining members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, titled Move Like This, which was released on May 10, 2011. The first single from the album was Sad Song. It was released to radio on March 1, 2011.

      "editorial_notes": "New Wave was the far more commercial successor to punk rock, with bands like The Cars, Blondie, Devo and The B-52’s emphasizing big hooks, fast tempos, clever lyrics and dance-floor rhythms borrowed from disco and krautrock. It was youthful music, but not every New Waver was a newbie: When The Cars released their self-titled debut album in 1978, singer Ric Ocasek was a relatively ancient 34 years old. For context, he was born the same year as Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, who had passed through stardom and into near retirement by 1978, and Diana Ross, who was already a grande dame of pop.\n\nOcasek and singer and bassist Benjamin Orr were old pals, having been playing together for 10 years. They’d had a shot at the big time when their group Milkwood—an acoustic, Crosby, Stills & Nash-style folk band—released an album in 1972. The band failed to connect, so the two friends soldiered on in different formations and bands—Richard and the Rabbits, the acoustic duo Ocasek and Orr, the band Cap’n Swing—but nothing worked. What Ocasek learned from failure was that he needed to make music that moved <i>fast</i>, with tunes that were so thoroughly honed and plotted out that every element was a hook—an approach that soon became the mission statement for his next group: The Cars. It wasn’t just the band’s name that inspired automobile metaphors from reviewers and headline writers; The Cars’ music is the sonic equivalent of a sleek Pontiac Firebird with a 220 horsepower engine. No wonder the group became the top-selling New Wave act of the late 1970s.\n\n<i>The Cars</i> unleashed a trio of tunes—“Just What I Needed”, “My Best Friend’s Girl” and “Good Times Roll”—that would become hits on both rock radio and the singles charts, proving not only The Cars’ crossover appeal, but also the viability of New Wave. Ocasek’s lyrics lean toward the cryptic, and are full of a muted emotionality that feels tense and clipped, but also clever (it’s hard to imagine any other singer writing a line like “Let them brush your rock ’n’ roll hair” and making it sound like good advice). His thin, nervous voice can be heard on five tracks here, while Orr handles the rest, including “Just What I Needed”, “Bye Bye Love” and “Moving in Stereo”—the latter of which was etched into pop culture history a few years later, when it soundtracked an infamous poolside scene in 1982’s <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>.
