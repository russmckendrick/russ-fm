Japanese singer songwriter; \n4. A Belgian hardcore band from Antwerp; \n5. A German folk band from Berlin; \n6. The Australian electronic artist Paul Jextra; \n7.  An  Italian disco band active in the 1980s; \n8. An American rock'n'roll/rockabilly band from Arkansas. \n9.......\nFor more artists with this name, see; \nhttps://musicbrainz.org/search?query=Caravan&type=artist&method=indexed\n\n1. Caravan are a British progressive rock band from Canterbury, United Kingdom, founded by former Wilde Flowers members David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair, Pye Hastings, and Richard Coughlan. Caravan rose to success over a period of several years from 1968 onwards into the 1970s as part of the Canterbury scene which also included Soft Machine. Caravan still continue a part-time gigging existence into the present.\n\nThe band were largely dormant in the 1980s, but a 1990 reunion, planned as a one-off for U.K. television's Bedrock show, restarted their career. Latterly they have also achieved steady sales and a fan following with the support of the more eclectic corners of radio, like BBC Six Music's Freak Zone and the growing re-emergence of progressive rock. \n* Official site\n\n2. Caravan are a Thai \"folk-rock\" band from the 1970s. They are the progenitors of the เพลงเพื่อชีวิต (pleng puea chiwit) or \"songs for life\" genre. Their music is loosely adapted folk-rock rhythms and melodies from American & British protest songs of the time and interlaced them with Thai folk idioms and instrumentation. \n\nThe band was founded in the early 1970s by student protest leaders surachai chanthimathon & wirasak sunthonsi. Their tunes & lyrics were a vital force for bringing the messages of urban student activism out to the provinces. In the wake of the massacre at thammasat university, the band fled Bangkok, some heading into the mountains of the northeast to join the communist insurgency in armed struggle. Needless to say, their music was banned from radioplay for quite a while, broadcast only from pirate stations in the hills. \n\n3.

He handed out copies of his independent demo titled \"Homework#1\" during his live shows.\n\nIn 2004, he released his first indie album \"RAW LIFE MUSIC\" from the label AARON FIELDS, he followed this up with releasing another indie album in November titled \"Trip in the music\". \n\nWith the help of his Promotion Video of \"Soul music\" being played frequently on SPACE SHOWER TV, Caravan gained some popularity and in 2005, he was signed with rhythm zone (of avex label) and released his first single \"DAY DREAM\". In 2006, Caravan released his first major album \"WANDER AROUND\" and since then, he has managed to produce a album each year (2007: PANORAMA VISION, 2008: Yellow Morning, 2009: Luck and Pluck) and in 2010, he released two best of albums titled \"The Planet songs: vol1 + 2.\" \n\n4.

            "content": "In the Land of Grey and Pink is the third album by English progressive rock band Caravan, released in April 1971 on Deram Records. It was produced by David Hitchcock and was the last album to feature the original lineup of Richard Coughlan, Pye Hastings, Richard Sinclair and Dave Sinclair until 1982's Back to Front.\n\nThe album was written and recorded during late 1970 and early 1971, and featured more material from Richard Sinclair. Hastings, who had been the main songwriter on the previous two releases, contributed only one track. Instrumentally, the music is dominated by David Sinclair's keyboard solos, and side two is taken up by a 22-minute suite of songs, \"Nine Feet Underground\". The cover features a Tolkien-influenced painting.\n\nThe album was critically well received but was not a chart success, which led to frustration within the band and David Sinclair's departure. Nevertheless, it has remained in print and sold steadily, and been recommended by critics as a good introduction to the Canterbury Scene genre. The band look back favourably on the album and several of its tracks have remained fixtures in Caravan's live repertoire. It has been reissued several times, including a comprehensive 40th anniversary remix package by British musician and producer Steven Wilson in 2011. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Caravan/In+the+Land+of+Grey+and+Pink\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
