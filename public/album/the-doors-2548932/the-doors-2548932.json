      "biography": "The Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, California, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger. The band took its name from Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, the title of which was a reference to a William Blake quotation: \"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.\" They were among the most controversial rock acts of the 1960s, due mostly to Morrison's wild, poetic lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until finally disbanding in 1973.\n \nThey were signed to Elektra Records in 1966. The 1967 release of The Doors was the first in a series of top ten albums in the US, followed by Strange Days (1967), Waiting for the Sun (1968), The Soft Parade (1969), Morrison Hotel (1970), Absolutely Live (1970) and L.A. Woman (1971), with 19 Gold, 14 Platinum and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone. Although The Doors' active career ended in 1973, their popularity has persisted. According to the RIAA, they have sold 32.5 million certified units in the US. The band has sold 100 million albums worldwide. Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger continue to tour as Manzarek-Krieger or Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger of The Doors for legal issues, performing Doors songs exclusively. The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs. In 1993, The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

      "editorial_notes": "There have been plenty of classic debut albums. But few first-attempt records have defined an era while simultaneously birthing an idol, as <i>The Doors</i> did upon its release in January 1967. The impact wasn’t immediate: The album’s first single, “Break On Through (To the Other Side)”, failed to break into the Hot 100—meaning that, for a while, the most visible marker of The Doors’ success was limited to billboards on the Sunset Strip, which featured Morrison and his bandmates. The equal billing was appropriate, as <i>The Doors</i> was undoubtedly a group effort: The seeds of many of these 11 tracks had mostly been planted by Morrison, but the group’s eventual smash single, “Light My Fire”, had been originally composed by guitarist Robby Kreiger, with the song's iconic organ intro and the groovy bossa-nova-inspired rim clicks created by keyboardist Ray Manzerek and drummer John Densmore, respectively.\n\nBut it was Morrison—with his tight leather pants, heavy eyelids and booming baritone—who took center stage when the band performed “Light My Fire” on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> that September. And it was Morrison who sang the controversial line “Girl, we couldn’t get much higher” over the protests of the show’s producers—and thus beamed the Southern California counterculture to 40 million American viewers. That wasn’t the only shock generated by Morrison and <i>The Doors</i>: The singer’s infamous soliloquy on “The End”—“Father/Yes, son?/I want to kill you/Mother, I want to…”—has been endlessly analysed for its Oedipal assertions. And the haunting intro to “The End” captured a new generation of fans when it soundtracked the opening of <i>Apocalypse Now</i> in 1979, sparking a renaissance of sorts for the band into the 1980s.",

            "content": "\"The Doors\" is the debut studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released on January 4, 1967, by Elektra Records. It was recorded during August and September 1966 at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California, with Paul A. Rothchild as producer. The album includes the full-length version of the band's breakthrough single \"Light My Fire\" and the extended closing track \"The End\", which features a spoken word section that references the Oedipus myth.\n\nThe band developed much of the album's material throughout 1966, performing it at various venues, most notably the Whisky a Go Go. Recording began shortly after the group was dismissed from that club and signed to Elektra Records. The album reflects the band's diverse musical influences, incorporating elements of jazz, classical, blues, pop, R\\&B, and rock. It is widely regarded as a seminal psychedelic rock album and has influenced numerous subsequent artists and recordings.\n\n\"The Doors\" and the song \"Light My Fire\" have both been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2015, the Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry, recognising its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance. As of 2015, the album had sold over 13 million copies worldwide, making it the band's best-selling release. It has received ongoing critical acclaim and was ranked number 42 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003 and 2012, and number 86 in the 2020 update of the list. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Doors/The+Doors\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
