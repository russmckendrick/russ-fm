      "biography": "The Jimi Hendrix Experience was an English-American psychedelic rock band that formed in London in October 1966. Comprising eponymous singer-songwriter and guitarist Jimi Hendrix, bassist and backing vocalist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, the band was active until June 1969, in which time the group released three successful studio albums. After Redding left the band, Hendrix and Mitchell stayed together through other projects. The Experience 'reunited' in 1970 with Billy Cox dubbed \"The Cry of Love\", until Hendrix's death in September 1970. Redding died in 2003, and Mitchell became the last original member of the band to die, in November 2008.\nWidely recognized as hugely influential on the development of hard rock and heavy metal in the late-1960s and beyond, The Experience were best known for the skill, style and charisma of frontman Hendrix, who has been voted one of the greatest guitarists by various music publications and writers. All three of the band's studio albums, Are You Experienced (1967), Axis: Bold as Love (1967) and Electric Ladyland (1968), were featured in the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time - each within the top 100 - at positions 15, 82 and 54 respectively. In 1992, The Jimi Hendrix Experience were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

The sessions had gotten too sloppy, the atmosphere too social. Hendrix seemed increasingly fixated on closing the gap between reality and his imagination—which, for an artist with ever-expanding resources, produced more friction than anything else: One track, “Gypsy Eyes”, took nearly 50 takes.\n\nIn a way, it’s a classic story of creative overindulgence: An artist with too much money and time convinces himself that more is better, and perfection is just around the corner. Compound that with a chorus of people singing your genius, and you see how Hendrix could feel inspired, albeit in a warped, highly pressured way. As bassist Noel Redding put it in a diary entry, the public seemed to want the band to keep doing what they were doing—while also getting better all the time.\n\nOn <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, Hendrix’s musical view had never been so vast: There’s blues (“Voodoo Chile”, “Gypsy Eyes”); psychedelic soul (“Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)”); short pop songs (“Crosstown Traffic”); and long, digressive tracks, most notably “1983… (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)”. He’d always had a distant relationship with Black audiences—at a neighbourhood fundraiser in Harlem in 1969, he reportedly went unnoticed until white people started pointing him out—but <i>Electric Ladyland</i> is nothing if not Afrofuturistic: an assertion that for all our culturally held stereotypes about Black music as bodily, social and down-to-earth, it could just as well be visionary and ethereal—as purely art as anything else.\n\nPart of what makes the album’s quest for perfection touching is that its real legacy lies in its messiness: An expansive, self-produced exploration of every corner of an artist’s mind that privileges range over concision, vision over execution, and the concept of pop more as a set of possibilities than a fixed product. It’s a creative ethos that lives on in mixtape culture, as well as albums like Frank Ocean’s <i>Blonde</i> or Kanye West’s <i>The Life of Pablo</i>—records that feel almost deliberately inconclusive, as though they’re living documents of a process. Had Hendrix lived, you imagine he would’ve ended up making it twice as long.",

He’d always had a distant relationship with Black audiences—at a neighbourhood fundraiser in Harlem in 1969, he reportedly went unnoticed until white people started pointing him out—but <i>Electric Ladyland</i> is nothing if not Afrofuturistic: an assertion that for all our culturally held stereotypes about Black music as bodily, social and down-to-earth, it could just as well be visionary and ethereal—as purely art as anything else.\n\nPart of what makes the album’s quest for perfection touching is that its real legacy lies in its messiness: An expansive, self-produced exploration of every corner of an artist’s mind that privileges range over concision, vision over execution, and the concept of pop more as a set of possibilities than a fixed product. It’s a creative ethos that lives on in mixtape culture, as well as albums like Frank Ocean’s <i>Blonde</i> or Kanye West’s <i>The Life of Pablo</i>—records that feel almost deliberately inconclusive, as though they’re living documents of a process. Had Hendrix lived, you imagine he would’ve ended up making it twice as long."

            "content": "The third and final  Jimi Hendrix Experience album was released first in America during September 1968. The themes and images of Electric Ladyland are key introductions to spiritual realms at the core of modern music.\n\n It is the only Hendrix studio album professionally produced under his supervision. It topped the Billboard 200 album chart for two weeks in November 1968. Released as a double album, Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix's wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", previously a U.K. single in the summer of 1967; the extended blues jam \"Voodoo Chile\"; the New Orleans-style R&B; of Earl King's \"Come On\"; the epic studio production of \"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\"; the social commentary of \"House Burning Down\"; and the Sixties-era Britpop of Noel Redding's \"Little Miss Strange\". The album also features an electric reworking of the Bob Dylan classic \"All Along the Watchtower\", which has been well received by critics as well as by Dylan himself, and also \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\", a staple of both radio and guitar repertoire.\n\nFollowing the first installment of recordings from Olympic Studios in London, including part of \"All Along the Watchtower\" and the aforementioned 1967 single, production moved during the spring of 1968 to the newly opened Record Plant Studios, situated close to Hendrix's favorite New York clubs. Recording there was by Jimi's favorite engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren. Despite a claim by Record Plant engineer Chris Stone that Kellgren engineered \"90%\" of Ladyland, the studio records show that most of the work was done by Kramer, only three tracks including the one by Redding having Kellgren as engineer.\n\nDuring the recording of the album, Hendrix fell out with producer Bryan \"Chas\" Chandler and Redding. Both of them grew tired with the undisciplined way Hendrix was working in the studio, because he was constantly inviting his friends and acquaintances in there. Chandler hated spending so much time in the studio and partly blamed it on these guests, but Jimi was determined to have his way. Chandler also complained that Hendrix's insistence on doing multiple takes of every song, combined with what he saw as Hendrix's drugged incoherence, led him to sell his share of the management company to his partner Michael Jeffery. Chandler quit in May 1968, leaving Hendrix sole producer on the project.\n\nHendrix' studio perfectionism was legendary – he and Mitch Mitchell recorded well over 50 takes of \"Gypsy Eyes\" over three sessions, Hendrix was generally insecure about his voice and often recorded his vocals hidden behind studio screens. Hendrix sang all the backing vocals himself on the title track and on \"Long Hot Summer Night\". He was said to be very happy with the vocal results on \"Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)\".\n\nMany of the album tracks show Hendrix's vision expanding far beyond the scope of the original trio and saw him collaborating with a range of outside musicians including Dave Mason, Chris Wood and Steve Winwood from Traffic; future Band of Gypsys drummer Buddy Miles; Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady; former Dylan organist Al Kooper; and members of 'the Serfs': Mike Finnegan on organ, Freddie Smith on saxophone, and Larry Faucette on congas. Cooperation between Hendrix and Redding, who was of the same opinion about time spent in the studio as Chandler, was strained during production. Hendrix plays bass on many tracks, including the bass solo on \"1983\". At times Hendrix recorded bass tracks simply to make things proceed faster. Redding plays acoustic guitar and sings lead vocals with Mitchell on \"Little Miss Strange\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jimi+Hendrix+Experience/Electric+Ladyland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
