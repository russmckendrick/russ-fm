  "biography": "The Dukes of Stratosphear was a pseudonym used by the English rock band XTC in the mid-1980s. A studio-only project, the band released two vinyl albums: 25 O'Clock (1985) and Psonic Psunspot (1987), which drew upon influences of 1960s psychedelic music such as The Beatles, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, The Kinks, The Byrds, The Pretty Things, and The Beach Boys (c. 1966). The two albums were released on a single CD under the title Chips from the Chocolate Fireball (An Anthology) in late 1987.\n\nThey reformed and recorded the track \"Open a Can of Human Beans\" in 2003 for a charity album. The track was later re-released on Andy Partridge's Fuzzy Warbles, Vol. 7.\n\nUnder another pseudonym, Terry and the Lovemen, XTC appeared on its own tribute album A Testimonial Dinner and thanked The Dukes of Stratosphear for the loan of their instruments.\n\nThe pseudonymous personnel included:\n\n Sir John Johns (Andy Partridge) - singing, guitar, brain buds;\n The Red Curtain (Colin Moulding) - electric bass, song stuff;\n Lord Cornelius Plum (Dave Gregory) - mellotron, piano, organ, fuzz-tone guitar;\n E.I.E.I. Owen (Ian Gregory) - drum set;\n and their preferred producer at that time, Swami Anand Nagara (John Leckie).\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Dukes+Of+Stratosphear\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
