Starting in the 1960s with the psychedelic band Nazz in Philadelphia, his solo career started out successfully with such hits as \"I Saw the Light\" and \"Hello It's Me\" (a reworked Nazz tune). With his 1972 release 'Something/Anything?' seen as a magnum opus due to its mix of power pop, rock n roll, and more. Utopia (or Todd Rundgren's Utopia) concentrated on eccentric progressive epics. His acclaimed production effort started early, with work for Sparks and the New York Dolls, and continued with Meat Loaf, XTC, The Psychedelic Furs, and many others. Continuing to release solo albums over the years, he's created many other hits, the novelty tune \"Bang the Drum All Day\" in particular seeming timeless. \n\nRundgren is well known among his fans as being an electronic music revolutionary.
