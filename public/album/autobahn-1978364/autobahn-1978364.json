      "biography": "Kraftwerk (\"power plant\" in English) are an electronic band founded in 1970 in Düsseldorf, Germany. They pioneered electronic music in the 70s and are considered the most important and influential band of their genre, often described as \"the godfathers of electronic music\". Kraftwerk's sound is minimalistic and strictly electronic; it combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies and vocals usually sung through a vocoder. The current line-up consists of Ralf Hütter (the only original member), Fritz Hilpert, Henning Schmitz and Falk Grieffenhagen. The other original founding member Florian Schneider left the band in 2008 and died on May 6th, 2020, following a short battle with cancer, just a few days after his 73rd birthday. \n\nRalf Hütter (born 1946, Krefeld, Germany) and Florian Schneider (born 1947, Düsseldorf, Germany) met while they were studying improvised music in Düsseldorf, Germany. In 1967 Ralf Hütter (organ), Florian Schneider (violin, flute), Basil Hammoudi (vocals), Butch Hauf (bass) and Fred Monics (drums) formed the group Organisation, released the album Tone Float and split shortly thereafter. The album features repetitive percussion and bass drum patterns embellished with guitar, flute, violin and organ. \n\nAfter disbanding Organisation, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider adopted the name Kraftwerk. Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970–1974 fluctuated, as Hütter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians, most notably Andreas Hohmann (drums; 1970), Houschäng Néjadepour (guitar; 1970), Charly Weiss (drums; 1970/71), Eberhard Kranemann (cello, bass, hawaii-guitar; 1970/71), Klaus Röder (electric guitar, electronic violin; 1974), Michael Rother (guitar; 1970-71) and Klaus Dinger (drums; 1970-71). For a short period in 1970/71 Ralf Hütter left the band to complete his degree in architecture. There were some sessions/concerts with the line-up \"Schneider, Kranemann, Weiss\",  \"Schneider, Hohmann, Kranemann, Rother, Dinger\" and \"Schneider, Rother, Dinger\" in that time.  In 1971 Rother and Dinger left Kraftwerk to form the band Neu!.\n\nTheir first three albums were more free-form experimental rock without the pop hooks or the more disciplined strong structure of its later work. Their debut album, Kraftwerk, released in 1970, and Kraftwerk 2, released in 1972, were mostly exploratory jam music, played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, electric organ, flute and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were then used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Connie Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums. Emil Schult has also collaborated on many releases, contributing both lyrics and graphics.\n\nLive performances from 1972–73 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine, with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. In 1973, Wolfgang Flür (electronic percussion) joined the group.\n\nWith Ralf und Florian, released in 1973, the band began to move closer to its classic sound, relying more heavily on synthesisers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the vocoder, which would, in time, become one of its musical signatures. \n\nIn 1974, they issued the fourth studio album, Autobahn. This critically acclaimed album marked Kraftwerk's breakthrough and established them as purveyors of electronic music. The title track is intended to capture the feeling of driving on the Autobahn: from travelling through the landscape, the high-speed concentration on the fast lane, to tuning the car radio and the monotony of a long trip. An edited version of \"Autobahn\" song reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and #11 in the UK.\n\nIn 1975, Karl Bartos (electronic percussion, live vibraphone, live keyboards) joined the band. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation is now regarded as the classic line-up of Kraftwerk, which remained in place until the late 80s.\n\nIn 1975, Kraftwerk released the concept album Radio-Activity (German version: Radio-Aktivität). The hyphenated album title displays Kraftwerk's typical deadpan humour, being a pun on the twin themes of the songs, half being about radioactivity and the other half about activity on the radio. The title track \"Radioactivity\" was released as a single, and became a hit in France after it was used as the theme to a popular music show. This was the first Kraftwerk album to be entirely self-produced by Hütter & Schneider in their Kling Klang studio, and the first one to be performed by the classic line-up of Kraftwerk.\n\nIn 1977, Kraftwerk released the highly influential album, Trans-Europe Express. Critics have described the album as having two specific themes: celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image. Musically, the songs on this album differ from the group's earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms, minimalism, and occasional manipulated vocals. Two singles supported the album: \"Trans-Europe Express\" and \"Showroom Dummies\".\n\nBy the time of 1978's The Man-Machine (German version: Die Mensch-Maschine), Kraftwerk had created their own unmistakable brand of \"robot pop\". NME said of The Man-Machine: 'It is the only completely successful visual/aural fusion rock has produced so far\". Kraftwerk spent three years building their own Kling Klang studios in the late 70s, complete with, inevitably, scores of computers. The single \"The Model\", gave the band a surprise hit when it topped the UK charts in 1982.\n\nIn 1981 Kraftwerk released their eight studio album, Computer World (German version: Computerwelt). This album combined the use of the sequencer to create the sound now known as electro, inspiring the first producers in Detroit in creating techno, as well as innumerable other artists including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, and New Order, among many others. This album had the theme of computers taking over the world in the future. It was a commercial success, spawning the singles \"Pocket Calculator\", \"Computer World\" and \"Computer Love\". For this album, the band embarked on the massive Computer World world tour.\n\nThe EP Tour De France was issued in 1983. This song was featured in the film Breakdance and became the theme for the cycling event of the same name in that year. In 1986, the ninth studio album Electric Café was released. The album received mixed reviews. Two singles were issued from the album: \"Musique Non-Stop\" and \"The Telephone Call\".\n\nIn 1987 Wolfgang Flür departed and it was replaced by Fritz Hilpert. In 1991, Kraftwerk's best known songs were collected together and re-recorded on the compilation The Mix.\n\nThe single Expo 2000 released in December 1999 came as a surprise for Kraftwerk fans. A brand new song, although low key, sparked hopes of a new album. A video was released for this track, showing the band playing in wireframe suits, but no public appearances or interviews until 2003.\n\nIn 2003 the band released Tour de France Soundtracks, its first album of new material since 1986's Electric Café. The album was recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race, although it missed its original release date during the actual Tour. A completely new recording was made for the \"Tour De France\" track, based on the original 1983 arrangement.\n\nIn June 2005, Kraftwerk released Minimum-Maximum, their first official live album. It features two CDs and tracks recorded on their world tour during 2004, including concerts in Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, London, Budapest, Tallinn, Riga, Tokyo and San Francisco. The band also released a live DVD.\n\nFlorian Schneider officially left the band in January 2009, though news of his departure was reported as early as April 2008. His place was taken over by Stefan Pfaffe. \n\nIn 2009, the band issued The Catalogue (German version: Der Katalog), a box-set comprising eight albums by Kraftwerk that were released from 1974 to 2003. All albums were digitally remastered, with most of the cover art redesigned, including rare photographs in the liner notes that were not part of each album's original release.\n\nFollowing the release of The Catalogue and Florian Schneider's departure, Kraftwerk began a series of live tours, in which they would perform the entirety of the eight albums included in that box set. These performances featured surround sound and live video in 3D with provided glasses. During these tours, in 2012, Falk Grieffenhagen replaced Stefan Pfaffe as live video operator. In 2017, Kraftwerk released 3-D The Catalogue (German version: 3-D Der Katalog), containing the live performance versions of the tracks on The Catalogue, available with visuals on Blu-ray. It won a Grammy Award that year for Best Electronic/Dance Album.\n\nKraftwerk's influence has been incalculable. Hundreds of artists today in nearly every electronic music subgenre bear witness to their work. They are also reclusive, rarely giving interviews and making no media appearances. To this day Kraftwerk continues to tour precisely crafted sets of their classic songs with 3-D visuals.\n\nOfficial site: http://www.kraftwerk.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Autobahn (German for \"motorway\") is an album by Kraftwerk, released in 1974. The album’s 22-minute title track was edited to about 3 minutes for single release and reached #25 on the US Billboard charts, charting even higher around Europe, including #11 in the UK. This commercial success came after the band had released three highly experimental and purely instrumental albums.\nAutobahn is not a completely electronic album, as violin, flute, and guitar are used along with synthesizers. The title track features both untreated and vocoded vocals; the remaining tracks are purely instrumental. Kraftwerk used a Minimoog, an ARP Odyssey, an EMS Synthi AKS and various devices of their own design and implementation, such as their famous electronic drums.\nThe title track is intended to capture the feeling of driving on the Autobahn: from the high-speed concentration on the fast lane, to tuning the car radio, to the monotony of a long trip. Autobahn is also the first of Kraftwerk’s concept albums of sorts, which they have done up to 2003.\nThe front cover of the original German edition was painted by Emil Schult, a long-time collaborator of Ralf and Florian, who also co-wrote the lyrics to the song \"Autobahn\". The version released in the UK on the Vertigo label in 1974 had a differently designed cover, produced by the label’s in-house marketing department.\nKlaus Röder was not a member of the band for very long, and had left before the recording sessions were completed. Wolfgang Flür’s face was added to the group photo on the back cover of the original LP (grafted onto Emil Schult’s body) at the last minute when it was decided that he would stay as a permanent member of the band.\nKonrad Plank had reputedly played a large role in developing the Kraftwerk sound, and much of the recording and all of the mixing of the work took place at his studio in Cologne. Plank's contribution to the sound was evident in comparing the album version of \"Kometenmelodie\" with the rare demo-quality single \"Kohoutek-Kometenmelodie\", recorded without his input.\nFlür had played with the band since late in 1973, first appearing with them on a Berlin TV performance to promote their Ralf und Florian album. On that show, he debuted the band’s custom-built electronic percussion pads, and these feature heavily on the Autobahn album.\nAlthough Philips Records and Vertigo Records were the original labels that released the album, it has been reissued multiple times in various regions by Mercury Records, EMI Records, Parlophone Records, Warner Bros. Records and Elektra Records. There are also several variations in the artwork of these reissues. Currently, the EMI Compact Disc edition is the one which remains in print; it is only available as an import in North America.\n\nAlthough Kraftwerk's first three albums were groundbreaking in their own right, Autobahn is where the group's hypnotic electronic pulse genuinely came into its own. The main difference between Autobahn and its predecessors is how it develops an insistent, propulsive pulse that makes the repeated rhythms and riffs of the shimmering electronic keyboards and trance-like guitars all the more hypnotizing. The 22-minute title track, in a severely edited form, became an international hit single and remains the peak of the band's achievements — it encapsulates the band and why they are important within one track — but the rest of the album provides soundscapes equally as intriguing. Within Autobahn, the roots of electro-funk, ambient, and synth pop are all evident — it's a pioneering album, even if its electronic trances might not capture the attention of all listeners. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kraftwerk/Autobahn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
