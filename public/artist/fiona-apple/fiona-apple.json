  "biography": "Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter. She is known for her songwriting and has released five albums between 1996 and 2020, all of which reached the top 20 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. As of 2021, she has sold over 15 million records worldwide. Apple has received several awards, including three Grammy Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and a Billboard Music Video Award.\n\nApple is the youngest daughter of actor Brandon Maggart and was born in New York City. She was raised between her mother's home in New York and her father's in Los Angeles. Trained in classical piano as a child, she began writing her own songs at the age of eight. Her debut album, \"Tidal\" (1996), featured songs written during her teenage years and earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Performance for the single \"Criminal.\" Her second album, \"When the Pawn...\" (1999), produced by Jon Brion, received critical acclaim and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nFor her third album, \"Extraordinary Machine\" (2005), Apple initially worked with Brion and began recording in 2002. She later expressed dissatisfaction with the production and chose not to release the album in its original form, leading to fan protests directed at Epic Records under the mistaken belief that the label was withholding the release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. It was certified gold and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Her fourth studio album, \"The Idler Wheel...\" (2012), was critically praised and supported by a U.S. tour, receiving a nomination for Best Alternative Music Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Apple's fifth album, \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\" (2020), won two Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Performance for the single \"Shameika.\"\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Apple\n\nStudio albums\nTidal (1996)\nWhen the Pawn...(1999)\nExtraordinary Machine (2005)\nThe Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do (2012)\nFetch the Bolt Cutters (2020) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
