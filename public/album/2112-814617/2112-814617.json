      "biography": "Rush were a Canadian rock band formed in 1968 in Toronto, that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their 1974 self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.\n\nRush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with Fly by Night (1975), 2112 (1976), A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984) and Counterparts (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.\n\nRush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.\n\nAs of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nRush (1974)\nFly by Night (1975)\nCaress of Steel (1975)\n2112 (1976)\nA Farewell to Kings (1977)\nHemispheres (1978)\nPermanent Waves (1980)\nMoving Pictures (1981)\nSignals (1982)\nGrace Under Pressure (1984)\nPower Windows (1985)\nHold Your Fire (1987)\nPresto (1989)\nRoll the Bones (1991)\nCounterparts (1993)\nTest for Echo (1996)\nVapor Trails (2002)\nSnakes & Arrows (2007)\nClockwork Angels (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Canada’s Rush were among the groups who locked into a successful new formula that eschewed the conventions of the hit single for instrumental diversions and lyrical adventures that helped them stand out within the burgeoning scene. <i>2112</i> is Rush’s fourth album and the first to consistently capture their emerging vision. All accomplished musicians, the trio emphasized dynamics and thrilling trills to accentuate their epic musical vision. Arena rock was only beginning to find its place and Rush’s blend of progressive rock’s slow-building moods and their own anthemic powerchords proved to be an enlightening mixture. The title track is a seven-part, 20 minute epic where drummer Neil Peart’s Ayn Rand inspired lyrics are passionately expressed by bassist Geddy Lee’s shrieking delivery. The shorter selections that made up side two of the original album – “A Passage to Bangkok,” in particular – pointed up the band’s strengths as succinct writers as well. Rush became the exemplary power trio, every member finding their distinctive niche without sacrificing the collective power of the group sound.",

            "content": "2112 (\"Twenty-One Twelve\") is the fourth studio album by Canadian progressive rock band Rush, released in 1976. The Toronto dates of the 2112 tour were recorded and released as All The World's a Stage in September 1976. In 2006 a poll of Planet Rock listeners picked 2112 as the definitive Rush album.\n\nThe album 2112 features an eponymous seven-part suite written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, with lyrics written by Neil Peart. The suite tells a dystopian story set in the year 2112. Since the album is named after the suite it is mistakenly thought of as a concept album. Technically it is not, as the songs on the second side are completely unrelated to the plot of the suite. Rush repeated this arrangement in Hemispheres.\n\n2112 was the first Rush album listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\n Sticking to their principles\nThe band, pressured by their record company not to write another concept piece (after the previous album, Caress of Steel, containing two such songs, failed commercially), stuck to their principles and created what is hailed as their first masterpiece. It garnered them their first U.S. Top 100 album and would reach Gold status on November 16, 1977 (along with the band's then current release A Farewell to Kings and All The World's a Stage) and Platinum on February 25, 1981 (shortly after the release of Moving Pictures in 1981).\n\n\nThe 2112 suite\nMain article: 2112 (song)\nIn the year 2062, a galaxy-wide war results in the union of all planets under the rule of the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The world is controlled by the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx, who determine the content of all reading matter, songs, pictures - every facet of life during the year 2112 (\"The Temples of Syrinx\").\n\nA man discovers a guitar (ancient miracle) and learns to play new, different music from what he has ever heard. When he goes to present this to the priests of the Temples, they destroy the guitar. He goes into hiding and dreams of music; upon awakening he becomes severely depressed and commits suicide after a few more days in hiding. As he dies, another planetary battle begins (\"Grand Finale\") resulting in the (perhaps deliberately) ambiguous ending \"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation: We have assumed control.\" (This spoken section was created by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson reportedly \"messing around with a tape recorder\".)\n\nOn the album, Neil Peart credits \"With acknowledgment to the genius of Ayn Rand.\" Rand, a Russian-born American novelist and Objectivist philosopher, wrote a novella entitled Anthem (itself the title of another Rush song, from the album Fly By Night) from which Peart borrowed the broad strokes of the plot.\n\n\nRemaining songs\nThe other songs on the album stand alone from the title track, with Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson writing lyrics for one song each (\"Tears\" and \"Lessons\", respectively). All other lyrics were penned by Peart.\n\n\"Tears\" would be the first Rush song to feature an outside musician. Hugh Syme, who would play keyboards on a number of Rush songs in the future (ie. \"Different Strings\" on Permanent Waves and \"Witch Hunt\" on Moving Pictures) contributes a multi-tracked Mellotron string part to the track. \"A Passage to Bangkok\" and \"The Twilight Zone\" are songs typical of this time period of Rush. \"Twilight\" was written and recorded in one day. \"Something for Nothing\" closes out the album. Neil Peart states: \"All those paeans to American restlessness and the American road carried a tinge of wistfulness, an acknowledgment of the hardships of the vagrant life, the notion that wanderlust could be involuntary, exile as much as freedom, and indeed, the understanding that freedom wasn't free. In the mid-'70s, the band was driving to a show in downtown Los Angeles, at the Shrine Auditorium, and I noticed some graffiti splattered across a wall: 'Freedom isn't free,' and I adapted that for a song on 2112, 'Something for Nothing'\".\n\nCultural significance\nThe Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a non-profit Canadian charitable organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada's audio-visual heritage, has sponsored MasterWorks, which annually recognizes 12 culturally significant Canadian classics from the film, radio, TV and music industries. In 2006, 2112 was one of the albums chosen to be preserved.\n\nTrack listing\nAll music by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson and lyrics by Neil Peart except where noted.\n\n\n Side one\n\"2112\" – 20:37 \nI: \"Overture\" (music: Lifeson, Lee, Peart) – 4:32 \nII: \"The Temples of Syrinx\" – 2:13 \nIII: \"Discovery\" (music: Lifeson) – 3:29 \nIV: \"Presentation\" (music: Lifeson) – 3:42 \nV: \"Oracle: The Dream\" – 2:00 \nVI: \"Soliloquy\" – 2:21 \nVII: \"Grand Finale\" (music: Lifeson, Lee, Peart) – 2:14 \n\n Side two\n\"A Passage to Bangkok\" – 3:34 \n\"The Twilight Zone\" – 3:17 \n\"Lessons\" (Lifeson) – 3:51 \n\"Tears\" (Lee) – 3:31 \n\"Something for Nothing\" (music: Lee) – 3:59 \n\n Credits\nGeddy Lee - bass, keyboards, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - guitar \nNeil Peart - drums, percussion \nHugh Syme - Mellotron on \"Tears\" \nCharts\n\nAlbum\nBillboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1976 Pop Albums 61 \n\n Singles\nInformation \n\"The Twilight Zone\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n\"2112: Overture/The Temples of Syrinx\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n\"A Passage to Bangkok\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown\n \n\nRemaster Details\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs issued a Gold CD remaster in 1993. That release is now out of print.\n\nA Mercury Records remaster was issued in 1997.\n\nThe tray has a picture of star with man painting with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left. All remasters from Rush through to Permanent Waves are like this. This is just like the cover art of Retrospective I. \nThe remaster album art has all of the elements including the back cover, the story of 2112, lyrics, gatefold shots of the band and the star with man logo which were absent from the original CD.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/2112\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "2112 (\"Twenty-One Twelve\") is the fourth studio album by Canadian progressive rock band Rush, released in 1976. The Toronto dates of the 2112 tour were recorded and released as All The World's a Stage in September 1976. In 2006 a poll of Planet Rock listeners picked 2112 as the definitive Rush album.\n\nThe album 2112 features an eponymous seven-part suite written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, with lyrics written by Neil Peart. The suite tells a dystopian story set in the year 2112. Since the album is named after the suite it is mistakenly thought of as a concept album. Technically it is not, as the songs on the second side are completely unrelated to the plot of the suite. Rush repeated this arrangement in Hemispheres.\n\n2112 was the first Rush album listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\n Sticking to their principles\nThe band, pressured by their record company not to write another concept piece (after the previous album, Caress of Steel, containing two such songs, failed commercially), stuck to their principles and created what is hailed as their first masterpiece. It garnered them their first U.S. Top 100 album and would reach Gold status on November 16, 1977 (along with the band's then current release A Farewell to Kings and All The World's a Stage) and Platinum on February 25, 1981 (shortly after the release of Moving Pictures in 1981).\n\n\nThe 2112 suite\nMain article: 2112 (song)\nIn the year 2062, a galaxy-wide war results in the union of all planets under the rule of the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The world is controlled by the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx, who determine the content of all reading matter, songs, pictures - every facet of life during the year 2112 (\"The Temples of Syrinx\").\n\nA man discovers a guitar (ancient miracle) and learns to play new, different music from what he has ever heard. When he goes to present this to the priests of the Temples, they destroy the guitar. He goes into hiding and dreams of music; upon awakening he becomes severely depressed and commits suicide after a few more days in hiding. As he dies, another planetary battle begins (\"Grand Finale\") resulting in the (perhaps deliberately) ambiguous ending \"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation: We have assumed control.\" (This spoken section was created by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson reportedly \"messing around with a tape recorder\".)\n\nOn the album, Neil Peart credits \"With acknowledgment to the genius of Ayn Rand.\" Rand, a Russian-born American novelist and Objectivist philosopher, wrote a novella entitled Anthem (itself the title of another Rush song, from the album Fly By Night) from which Peart borrowed the broad strokes of the plot.\n\n\nRemaining songs\nThe other songs on the album stand alone from the title track, with Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson writing lyrics for one song each (\"Tears\" and \"Lessons\", respectively). All other lyrics were penned by Peart.\n\n\"Tears\" would be the first Rush song to feature an outside musician. Hugh Syme, who would play keyboards on a number of Rush songs in the future (ie. \"Different Strings\" on Permanent Waves and \"Witch Hunt\" on Moving Pictures) contributes a multi-tracked Mellotron string part to the track. \"A Passage to Bangkok\" and \"The Twilight Zone\" are songs typical of this time period of Rush. \"Twilight\" was written and recorded in one day. \"Something for Nothing\" closes out the album. Neil Peart states: \"All those paeans to American restlessness and the American road carried a tinge of wistfulness, an acknowledgment of the hardships of the vagrant life, the notion that wanderlust could be involuntary, exile as much as freedom, and indeed, the understanding that freedom wasn't free. In the mid-'70s, the band was driving to a show in downtown Los Angeles, at the Shrine Auditorium, and I noticed some graffiti splattered across a wall: 'Freedom isn't free,' and I adapted that for a song on 2112, 'Something for Nothing'\".\n\nCultural significance\nThe Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a non-profit Canadian charitable organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada's audio-visual heritage, has sponsored MasterWorks, which annually recognizes 12 culturally significant Canadian classics from the film, radio, TV and music industries. In 2006, 2112 was one of the albums chosen to be preserved.\n\nTrack listing\nAll music by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson and lyrics by Neil Peart except where noted.\n\n\n Side one\n\"2112\" – 20:37 \nI: \"Overture\" (music: Lifeson, Lee, Peart) – 4:32 \nII: \"The Temples of Syrinx\" – 2:13 \nIII: \"Discovery\" (music: Lifeson) – 3:29 \nIV: \"Presentation\" (music: Lifeson) – 3:42 \nV: \"Oracle: The Dream\" – 2:00 \nVI: \"Soliloquy\" – 2:21 \nVII: \"Grand Finale\" (music: Lifeson, Lee, Peart) – 2:14 \n\n Side two\n\"A Passage to Bangkok\" – 3:34 \n\"The Twilight Zone\" – 3:17 \n\"Lessons\" (Lifeson) – 3:51 \n\"Tears\" (Lee) – 3:31 \n\"Something for Nothing\" (music: Lee) – 3:59 \n\n Credits\nGeddy Lee - bass, keyboards, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - guitar \nNeil Peart - drums, percussion \nHugh Syme - Mellotron on \"Tears\" \nCharts\n\nAlbum\nBillboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1976 Pop Albums 61 \n\n Singles\nInformation \n\"The Twilight Zone\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n\"2112: Overture/The Temples of Syrinx\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n\"A Passage to Bangkok\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown\n \n\nRemaster Details\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs issued a Gold CD remaster in 1993.
