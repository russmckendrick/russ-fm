  "biography": "William Martin \"Billy\" Joel (born May 9, 1949, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man\", in 1973, Joel has become the sixth-best-selling recording artist and the third-best-selling solo artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. His compilation album Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2 is the third-best-selling album in the United States by discs shipped.\nJoel had Top 40 hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, achieving 33 Top 40 hits in the United States, all of which he wrote himself. He is also a six-time Grammy Award winner, a 23-time Grammy nominee and one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 150 million records worldwide. He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary, with Billy Joel positioned at No. 23. With the exception of the 2007 songs \"All My Life\" and \"Christmas in Fallujah\", Joel stopped writing and recording popular music after 1993's River of Dreams, but he continued to tour extensively until 2010. Joel was born in the Bronx, May 9, 1949 and raised in Hicksville, New York in a Levitt home. His father, Howard (born Helmuth), was born in Germany, the son of German merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel, who, after the advent of the Nazi regime, emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States. Billy Joel's mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England to Philip and Rebecca Nyman. Both of Joel's parents were Jewish. They divorced in 1960, and his father moved to Vienna, Austria. Billy has a sister, Judith Joel, and a half-brother, Alexander Joel, who is an acclaimed classical conductor in Europe and currently chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig.\nJoel's father was an accomplished classical pianist. Billy reluctantly began piano lessons at an early age, at his mother's insistence; his teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician/songwriter Timothy Ford. His interest in music, rather than sports, was a source of teasing and bullying in his early years. (He has said in interviews that his piano instructor also taught ballet. Her name was Frances Neiman, and she was a Juilliard trained musician. She gave both classical piano and ballet lessons in the studio attached to the rear of her house, leading neighborhood bullies to mistakenly assume that he was learning to dance.) As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning twenty-two bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after breaking his nose in his twenty-fourth boxing match.\nJoel attended Hicksville High School in 1967, but he did not graduate with his class. He had been helping his single mother make ends meet by playing at a piano bar, which interfered with his school attendance. At the end of his senior year, Joel did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, however, Joel decided to immediately begin a career in music. Joel recounted, \"I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'.\" Columbia did, in fact, become the label that eventually signed him. In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board and was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony, 25 years after he had left.",

Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man,\" in 1973, Joel has become a multi-million-selling recording artist. Joel recorded many popular hit songs and albums from 1971 until he stopped recording pop/rock music in 1993. He is one of the very few rock (or even pop) artists to have Top 10 hits in the \\'70s, \\'80s, and \\'90s. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he has sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and is the sixth best selling artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. \\n\\nJoel\\'s induction into the Songwriter\\'s Hall of Fame (Class of 1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Class of 1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) has further solidified his status as one of America\\'s leading music icons. He has continued to tour occasionally (sometimes with Elton John) in addition to writing and recording classical music.\\n\\nJoel first lived in the South Bronx, in New York City, but his family soon moved to Hicksville, Long Island. Often he himself, along with many in the media, have confused this with him living in neighboring Levittown, NY (formed 1947). In truth, Joel lived on Meeting Lane in Hicksville, a town that has existed since 1648, near the Levittown border, in a section of town where Post-WW2, there were houses developed by Abe Levitt, known as Levitt Houses, thus forming nearby Levittown. His father, Howard Joel, was a Jewish Holocaust survivor from Germany, whose father Karl Amson Joel owned the fourth largest mail order company in Germany before being dispossessed by the Nazis. His mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England, to an agnostic Jewish family. His parents later divorced, and his father moved back to Eastern Europe. His half-brother Alexander Joel is an acclaimed classical pianist and conductor in Europe, now living in New York. \\n\\nFrom an early age Joel had an intense interest in music; especially classical music. He began piano lessons at an early age, and his interest in music instead of sports was the source for much teasing and bullying in his early years. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, but abandoned the sport shortly after having his nose broken in a boxing match.\\n\\nJoel attended Hicksville High School, and was to have graduated in 1967. However, he was one English credit short of the graduation requirement; he overslept on the day of an important exam due to his late-night musician\\'s lifestyle.[citation needed] Faced with a summer in school to complete this requirement, he decided not to continue. He left high school without a diploma to begin a career in music. In 1992, the English credit requirement was waived by the Hicksville School Board and he received his diploma at Hicksville High\\'s graduation ceremony 25 years after he left the school.\\n\\nAt the age of 14 Joel joined his first band, The Echoes (which later became The Lost Souls). According to producer Shadow Morton, Joel was also the pianist on the Shangri-Las hit \"Remember (Walking In The Sand)\". In 1966, he joined The Hassles, a Long Island band that had some local success (\"Every Step I Take,\" \"You Got Me Hummin\\'\"). The Hassles released two albums The Hassles (1967) and Hour of the Wolf (1968) on the United Artists record label. Following The Hassles\\' demise in 1969, he formed the progressive rock duo Attila with Hassles drummer Jon Small. Attila released their eponymous debut album in July 1970 and disbanded the following October.\\n\\nUpon losing his record contract with Attila, Joel suffered severe depression, and was admitted into Meadowbrook Hospital after ingesting furniture polish in a half-hearted suicide attempt. The note he left eventually became the lyrics to his song \"Tomorrow Is Today.\" Upon release from Meadowbrook Hospital in early 1971, he began to re-explore his place in the music business, including the participation in a television commercial with Chubby Checker and the contribution of rock criticism to a music magazine called Changes.\\n\\n*Cold Spring Harbor (1971)\\nJoel signed his first solo record contract with Artie Ripp of Family Productions, and subsequently recorded his first solo album. Cold Spring Harbor (a reference to the Long Island town of the same name), was released in 1971. However, the album was mastered at the wrong speed, and the album was initially released with this error, resulting in Joel sounding a half step too high (Joel later commented that he sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks). The onerous terms of the Family Productions contract also guaranteed him very little money from the sales of his albums.\\n\\nIn order to get out of the deal with Family Productions, Joel moved to Los Angeles, California with Elizabeth Weber, and they married in Los Angeles in May, 1971. For six months of the following year, he played in the Executive Lounge piano bar under the name Bill Martin. This experience is what gave him the material for \"Piano Man.\"\\n\\nIn addition, a Philadelphia radio station, WMMR-FM, started playing a tape of a new song, \"Captain Jack,\" which was taken from a live concert broadcast which became an underground hit on the East Coast. An Executive from Columbia Records named Herb Gordon, heard his music and made his record label aware of Joel\\'s talent. From there he signed with Columbia Records. Hits such as \"She\\'s Got a Way\" and \"Everybody Loves You Now\" were originally released on this album, though they did not gain much attention until released as live performances in 1981 on Songs in the Attic. Since then they have become regular concert numbers. Cold Spring Harbor got a second chance on the charts in 1983, when Columbia reissued the album after slowing it down to the correct speed. The album reached # 158 in the US and # 95 in the UK nearly a year later.\\n\\n*Piano Man (1973)\\nHis experiences in Los Angeles connected him with record company executives, who bought out his contract with Ripp, with the condition that the \"Family Productions\" logo be displayed alongside the Columbia logo for the next five albums. Also in the contract was the agreement that Family Productions would receive a 25 cent royalty for every album Joel sold, which would come back to haunt him when he hit it big. His brief tenure in Los Angeles also inspired his signature song \"Piano Man.\" The album Piano Man was released in late 1973 and was certified Gold. To this day it has sold over four million copies. However, due to the large sums of money involved in the legal tangles of the contract buyout, Joel netted less than $7,000 in profit from his certified Gold record. Although this album is best known for its title track, several other future gems include \"Captain Jack,\" \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" and \"You\\'re My Home\" (the b-side of the \"Piano Man\" single, which would later be covered by Helen Reddy), all of which would become staples of Joel\\'s live shows.\\n\\n*Streetlife Serenade (1974)\\nJoel remained in Los Angeles to write Streetlife Serenade, his second album under the Columbia label. References to both suburbia and the inner city pepper the album. The standout track on the album is \"The Entertainer,\" which picks up thematically where \"Piano Man\" left off. Joel was upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly edited down in order to make it more radio-friendly, and in \"The Entertainer,\" he refers to the edit with sarcastic lines such as, \"If you\\'re gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" This refers to the album version of this song which is 5:37, and the edited single which is 3:05. Although Streetlife Serenade is considered one of Joel\\'s weaker albums (Joel has confirmed his distaste for the album), it still contains some notable tracks including the title track, with its Debussy-like intro, \"Los Angelenos,\" and the instrumental \"The Mexican Connection.\"\\n\\n*Turnstiles (1976)\\nDisenchanted with the LA music scene, Joel returned to New York in 1975. There he recorded what many fans and critics consider one of his best albums, Turnstiles. On Turnstiles, Joel used his own hand-picked musicians in the studio for the first time, and took a more hands-on role. Songs were initially recorded and produced by famed Chicago producer James William Guercio, who subsequently was fired. The songs were re-recorded and Joel took over, producing the album himself. Joel\\'s \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" was a minor hit, echoed the Phil Spector sound, and was even covered by Ronnie Spector. The album also featured the New York anthem, \"New York State of Mind,\" a bluesy, jazzy epic that has become one of Joel\\'s signature songs and was later covered by fellow Columbia labelmate Barbra Streisand on her Streisand Superman album. Other top songs on the album include \"Summer, Highland Falls,\" and \"Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway).\" Songs such as \"Prelude/Angry Young Man\" would become a mainstay of his concerts for years.\\n\\n*The Stranger (1977)\\nFor his album The Stranger, Columbia Records united Joel with producer Phil Ramone. The album yielded four Top 40 hits on the Billboard Charts in the US. Album sales exceeded Columbia\\'s previous top album, Simon & Garfunkel\\'s Bridge Over Troubled Water, and was certified multi-platinum. It was Joel\\'s first Top Ten album, as it rose to # 2 on the charts. Phil Ramone eventually produced every Billy Joel studio release until 1989\\'s Storm Front. The Stranger netted Joel Grammy nominations, for Album of the Year and Song of the Year, for \"Just the Way You Are\", which was written as a gift to his wife Elizabeth and became his highest charting song to date in the United States.\\n\\nIn 2007 \"The Stranger\" was re-released with a bonus disk of a live concert recorded at Carnegie Hall June 3, 1977 that featured mostly songs from his first three albums. One can only guess that the success of \"The Stranger\" and \"52nd Street\" made this live album a bit obsolete for release at the time.\\n\\n*52nd Street (1978)\\nJoel faced high expectations on his next album. 52nd Street was conceived as a day in Manhattan, and was named after the block where Columbia Records\\' office was located. Fans purchased over seven million copies on the strength of the hits \"My Life\", \"Big Shot,\" and \"Honesty.\" This helped 52nd Street become Joel\\'s first # 1 album. \"My Life\" eventually became the theme song for a new US television sitcom, Bosom Buddies, which featured actor Tom Hanks in one of his earliest roles. 52nd Street was the first album to be released on Compact Disc in Japan (1982). The album won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male & Album of the Year. Despite all the cover art for the album showing Joel holding a trumpet, he doesn\\'t play the instrument on the album. The trumpet is only played on one track, \"Zanzibar\", by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.\\n\\n*Glass Houses (1980)\\nJoel in a promotional picture for Glass Houses.The success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Honesty\" never sat well with him. With Glass Houses, Joel attacked the new wave popularity with aplomb. This album yielded such classics as \"You May Be Right\" (# 7, May 1980), \"Close To The Borderline\"(flipside of the \"You May Be Right\" single), \"Don\\'t Ask Me Why\" (# 19, September 1980), \"Sometimes A Fantasy\" (# 36, November 1980) and \"It\\'s Still Rock & Roll to Me,\" which became Joel\\'s first Billboard # 1 song in July, 1980. Glass Houses won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It would also win the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category.\\n\\n*Songs In The Attic (1981)\\nHis next release, Songs In The Attic, was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. Songs In The Attic was recorded during arena and club shows in June and July of 1980. This release introduced many fans, who just discovered Joel when The Stranger became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions.\\n\\n*The Nylon Curtain (1982)\\nThe next wave of Joel\\'s career commenced with the recording of The Nylon Curtain. Considered his most audacious and ambitious album, Joel took more than a page or two from the Lennon-McCartney songwriting style on this heavily Beatles-influenced album.\\nWork began on The Nylon Curtain in the spring of 1982. However, Joel was sidelined when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident. The driver ran a red light and collided with Joel, who was on his motorcycle. His left wrist was broken and his hand badly damaged. Due to surgery, which included the temporary insertion of five pins into his wrist, and a month in the hospital, production of the album was shut down temporarily while Joel recovered. In the meantime, Joel\\'s first video special, Live from Long Island, was recorded at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on December 30, 1982. The Nylon Curtain went to # 7 on the charts, supported by the popular singles \"Allentown\", Goodnight Saigon, and Pressure. Allentown rose to # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982 and the most successful song from The Nylon Curtain album. The album is considered by many of his fans to be the masterpiece of his works. Joel\\'s marriage began to suffer as his success rose, and Joel and wife Elizabeth divorced. In accordance with the divorce agreement, Elizabeth took half of the singer\\'s assets. Following his tour supporting The Nylon Curtain, Joel retreated to the island of St. Bart\\'s for rest and relaxation. At the hotel\\'s bar, he met supermodel Christie Brinkley, who had been divorced from her husband Jean-François Allaux. They eventually became a couple, and married on March 23, 1985.\\n\\n*An Innocent Man (1983) \\nJoel in a promotional picture for An Innocent Man.The song \"Uptown Girl\" was one of the first songs written when Joel returned from vacation. \"Uptown Girl\" was conceived as Joel wondered aloud how the gorgeous Christie Brinkley could wind up with a guy like him. It became a worldwide hit upon its release, and Joel\\'s sole # 1 in the United Kingdom. The resulting album, An Innocent Man, was compiled as a tribute to the doo-wop music of the 1950s, and also resulted in Joel\\'s second Billboard # 1 hit, \"Tell Her About It.\" The album, which reached # 4 on the charts, boasted 6 top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel\\'s catalog. An Innocent Man was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but ultimately lost to Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller.\\n\\n*Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 (1985)\\nFollowing the success of An Innocent Man, Joel had been approached to release an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one\\'s career. This time, he agreed, and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 was released as a 4-sided album and 2-CD set, with the songs in sequence of when they were released. The new songs \"You\\'re Only Human (Second Wind)\" and \"The Night Is Still Young\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album. Greatest Hits was highly successful, selling over 20 million copies worldwide and becoming the top-selling double album of all time by a solo artist (and second overall after The Wall by Pink Floyd). It has since been certified diamond by the RIAA for 10.5 million albums sold (21 million disks). To date it is the 6th best selling album in American music history according to the RIAA.\\n\\nCoinciding with the Greatest Hits album release, Joel released a 2-volume Video Album that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the Greatest Hits album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man,\" for this project. Two versions of Greatest Hits were released on CD: the initial release on double CD in 1985, and a re-released Enhanced CD version in 1998. While both are the same basic album in general, there are a number of subtle differences between the two:\\n\\nWhile all the longer hits (\"Piano Man,\" \"Captain Jack,\" \"Goodnight Saigon\") are fully intact, many other shorter songs (\"Pressure,\" \"Just The Way You Are,\" \"My Life\") were shortened significantly in the 1985 release. Oddly enough, the included booklet lists all of the lyrics, even the parts cut for time. These songs are fully restored in the re-release. The 1985 release features the live version of \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" from Songs in the Attic. The version from Turnstiles was used for the 1998 re-release. \\nThe 1998 re-release features enhanced content due to advancements in CD technology over the previous 13 years. \\n\\n*The Bridge (1986)\\nJoel had already scored a hit with \"Modern Woman\" from the 1985 movie, \"Ruthless People,\" (starring Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Helen Slater and Judge Reinhold), when he began work on the album that would become The Bridge in early 1986. Ray Charles contributed vocals and music to the song \"Baby Grand\" with Joel, and Steve Winwood played Hammond organ on the song \"Getting Closer.\" The final song recorded for the album was \"Code Of Silence.\" Cyndi Lauper appears on the album, contributing backing vocals. Though it broke into the Top Ten, The Bridge was not a success in relation to some of Joel\\'s other albums, but it yielded the hit \"A Matter Of Trust.\" In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in its video as playing a Les Paul-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad \"This Is The Time\" also charted, and has been a favorite on the prom circuit ever since. \"Modern Woman\" was also released as a single and was quite successful, but Joel has since said in interviews he doesn\\'t care for the song, and subsequently it has been left off most of his compilation sets (the exception appears to be My Lives). It was also the last Billy Joel album to carry the \"Family Productions\" logo.\\n\\nAt around this time, Billy completed voice work on Disney\\'s Oliver & Company, released in 1988. A loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist, Billy brought both his acting and musical talents to the film as Dodger. For the film, Billy recorded a song titled \"Why Should I Worry?\" Critics were generally positive towards the film, and pointed to Billy\\'s acting contribution as one of its highlights, despite it being his first acting job. In interviews, Billy explained that he took the job due to his love of Disney cartoons as a child.\\n\\nThroughout his tour supporting The Bridge, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. He would be the first American rock act to play there since the Berlin Wall went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel. There would be six live performances, three each at indoor arenas in Moscow and Leningrad. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in June 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to eventually offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.\\n\\nThe audience in at least the first Moscow shows was filled with members of the Communist Party, who received tickets from the government as a perk. Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel\\'s energetic show, something that never had happened in other countries he had performed in. As a result of that a minor international incident occurred when he famously flipped over an electric keyboard during the second Moscow show as a show of frustration that his lighting engineers would not turn down the house lights to calm the audience despite several requests. The lighting engineers were more concerned with the amount of light being adequate for filming. \\n\\n*КОНЦЕРТ (1987)\\nThe album КОНЦЕРТ, Russian for \"Concert,\" was released in the fall of 1987. Singer Peter Hewlitt was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man.\" It has been estimated that Joel lost over US $1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.\\n\\n* Storm Front (1989)\\nThe song \"We Didn\\'t Start the Fire,\" the first single from the album Storm Front, was released in September 1989. The song became Joel\\'s third US Number 1 hit. Storm Front was released in October, and it eventually became Joel\\'s first Number 1 album since Glass Houses, 9 years earlier. Storm Front was Joel\\'s first album since Turnstiles to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner fame. Joel also brought in some fresh faces to join the band, including talented multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero, who would go on to become Joel\\'s musical director and architect of his live sound. After \"We Didn\\'t Start The Fire,\" Storm Front also produced the hit \"I Go To Extremes.\" The album was also notable for its song \"Leningrad,\" written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city during his tour in 1987, and \"The Downeaster Alexa,\" written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album was the ballad \"And So It Goes.\"\\n\\nIn 1992, Joel sued former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber (ex-wife Elizabeth\\'s brother) for $95 million after accounting irregularities were discovered. The case later settled out of court. \\n\\n*River of Dreams (1993)\\nJoel started work on River of Dreams in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date. The album includes hits such as \"The River of Dreams\", \"All About Soul\", \"The Great Wall of China\", and \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\", written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on \"The Essential Billy Joel\" (2001).\\n\\nIn August 1995, Billy Joel\\'s long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer committed suicide in his Long Island home. Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel\\'s albums from Turnstiles through The Bridge.\\n\\nIn 1999 Joel performed at New York\\'s Madison Square Garden on the eve of the new millennium which at the time was considered to be Joel\\'s last solo concert, The concert (dubbed The Night Of The 2000 Years) ran on close to 4 hours and was later released as 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert\\n\\nIn 2001 Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were written by Billy Joel and performed by Richard Joo. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances. The album topped the classical charts at # 1. On September 21, 2001, Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert.\\n\\nJoel has toured extensively with Elton John on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours. During these shows, the two have played each other\\'s songs and performed duets.\\n\\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, My Lives, which is largely a compilation of demos, B-tracks, and live/alternate versions to hit songs. The compilation also includes the Umixit software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\", \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Keepin\\' The Faith\", and live versions of \"I Go To Extremes\" and \"Movin\\' Out (Anthony\\'s Song)\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the River of Dreams tour is included.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the United States. Having not written any new songs, he featured a sampling of all his songs in his career, including his major hits. His tour includes an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\\n\\nOn June 13, 2006, Joel released \"12 Gardens: Live\", a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during his 2006 tour.\\n\\nThe singer\\'s stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, when he played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena.\\n\\nThe record has consequently earned Joel the only retired number in the arena owned by a non-athlete. The retired number, which was 12, hangs in the rafters along with many others such as hockey great Mark Messier.\\n\\n2006 also saw Billy Joel visit the United Kingdom and Ireland (as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour) for the first time in many years, playing to capacity crowds in Birmingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester, Glasgow, London and Dublin.\\n\\nOn July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in Rome, Italy with the Colosseum as the backdrop, and performed classic hits for hundreds of thousands of fans. Joel performed favorites such as \"New York State of Mind,\" \"Honesty,\" and \"Just the Way You Are.\"\\n\\nWhile introducing one song, the 57-year-old singer joked in shaky Italian, \"This song is as old as the Colosseum.\"\\n\\nOrganizers estimated 500,000 people turned out for the show. The concert was opened by Canadian pop-rocker and songwriter Bryan Adams.\\n\\nBilly Joel will tour South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006.\\n\\nJoel\\'s lyrics have made many references to locations in the New York City metropolitan area, particularly Long Island. For example, the \"Miracle Mile\" line in 1980\\'s \"It\\'s Still Rock & Roll to Me\" refers to the affluent shopping district located on Northern Boulevard in the community of Manhasset and 1980\\'s \"You May Be Right\" references walking through the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn alone as proof of craziness. In his 1973 song \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" he describes a certain \"Billy\" as being from the town of Oyster Bay, the municipality in which the hamlet of Hicksville is located. He has since stated, in the liner notes from his album Songs in the Attic, that this \"Billy\" is not himself, but rather an Oyster Bay bartender.\\n\\nSeveral of Joel\\'s songs have grown out of specific personal experiences, including \"Piano Man,\" which he wrote describing his regular job playing at a Los Angeles piano bar in the early 1970s, and \"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,\" purportedly written about either the Syosset mainstay Christiano\\'s or a similar eatery in New York City\\'s Little Italy. His song \"Vienna\" was supposedly written about a visit to his father in Europe, while \"Big Shot\" was based on a bad date with Mick Jagger\\'s ex-wife Bianca.\\n\\nIn a Playboy interview, Joel indicated that \"Rosalinda\\'s Eyes\" was penned for his mother, Rosalinda, as the song his father should have written for her.\\n\\n\"Only The Good Die Young\" created a bit of a stir within the religious community when it was first released in 1977. Some radio stations even refused to give the song any airtime. It is said that while Joel was doing a show in St. Louis, he had been specifically asked not to perform the song during the show and even received death threats; in response, Joel played it twice. Joel has said about the song that \"the point of the song wasn\\'t so much anti-Catholic as [it was] pro-lust\".\\n\\nHis music reflects influences from many different genres including European classical composers, Aaron Copland, 1950s doo wop, Broadway/Tin Pan Alley, jazz, blues, punk, ska, gospel, pop, and even Russian folk songs, to straight-up rock & roll. This has, in part, led to his broad success over a long period of time, but made him difficult to categorize in popular music today.\\n\\nIn the mid 1970s, the touring and studio lineup of Joel\\'s band stabilized. The main lineup consisted of:\\n\\nBilly Joel - lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, organ, harmonica \\nLiberty DeVitto — drums, percussion \\nDoug Stegmeyer — bass guitar, backing vocals \\nRussell Javors — rhythm guitars, backing vocals \\nDavid Brown — lead guitars \\nRichie Cannata — saxophones, flute, clarinet, organ, percussion, backing vocals \\nThis was also the lineup for Joel\\'s first live album, Songs In The Attic.\\n\\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw significant changes to Joel\\'s band. By the River of Dreams tour the only remaining long standing member of the band was DeVitto on drums. Multi-instrumentalists Crystal Taliefero and Mark Rivera joined and remain in his band to this day. Rivera had taken over the prominent saxophone solo in the song \"New York State of Mind\" that had previously been performed by Cannata (and was re-recorded by Rivera for the Greatest Hits version of the song). The 1993 River of Dreams tour saw the addition of Dave Rosenthal on keyboards who also remains with the band. Tommy Byrnes has become a frequent band member on guitar and was both a musical consultant and band member in the Movin\\' Out musical. For the 2006 tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as drummer. Chuck Burgi (from the Broadway production of Joel\\'s musical \\'Movin\\' Out\\') replaced DeVitto. Richie Cannata returns on saxophones, along with Mark Rivera and Crystal Taliefero, with Cannata again performing the \"New York State Of Mind\" solo.\\n\\n\\nDespite having never graduated from high school, Joel has been presented with multiple honorary doctorates:\\n\\nHonorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Syracuse University\\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University (1991) \\nDoctor from Berklee College of Music (1993) \\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University (1997) \\nDoctor of Music from Southampton College (2000) \\nDoctor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University (2006)[8] \\n\\nJoel was also named MusiCares Person of the Year for 2002, an award given each year at the same time as the Grammy Awards. At the dinner honoring Joel, various artists performed versions of his songs including Nelly Furtado, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Diana Krall, Rob Thomas, and Natalie Cole. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on Oct 15, 2006.\\n\\nIn 2004, Joel married 23 year-old Katie Lee. Lee is a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At the time of the wedding, Joel was 54. Joel\\'s daughter, Alexa Ray, 18, served as maid of honor. Joel\\'s second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. Lee works as a restaurant correspondent for the PBS show, George Hirsch: Living it Up!. In 2006, Katie Lee hosted Bravo\\'s Top Chef.\\n\\nIn 2002 he crashed his car in East Hampton, New York, and soon after entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 2003 Joel crashed his car into a tree in eastern Long Island, and was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. In April 2004, Joel crashed his car into a house on Long Island. In March 2005 Joel checked into a Betty Ford rehabilitation center[12], where he spent 30 days. \\n\\nMovin\\' Out (2002), is a musical based on twenty-four Billy Joel songs which was a smash hit on Broadway from 2002 to 2005 (last Broadway show was on December 11, 2005). Joel was composer, lyricist, and orchestrator; Tony Award for Best Orchestrations. The musical is really a dance performance choreographed by famed choreographer Twyla Tharp, with Joel\\'s songs sung by Michael Cavanaugh. \\n\\nIn 2014, he started a series of concerts at New York City\\'s Madison Square Garden, and vowed to perform monthly as long as demand continued.  He sold out 73 consecutive shows through February 2020, before the record-setting series went on hiatus due to the pandemic.\\n\\nhttp://www.billyjoel.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man,\" in 1973, Joel has become a multi-million-selling recording artist. Joel recorded many popular hit songs and albums from 1971 until he stopped recording pop/rock music in 1993. He is one of the very few rock (or even pop) artists to have Top 10 hits in the \\'70s, \\'80s, and \\'90s. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he has sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and is the sixth best selling artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. \\n\\nJoel\\'s induction into the Songwriter\\'s Hall of Fame (Class of 1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Class of 1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) has further solidified his status as one of America\\'s leading music icons. He has continued to tour occasionally (sometimes with Elton John) in addition to writing and recording classical music.\\n\\nJoel first lived in the South Bronx, in New York City, but his family soon moved to Hicksville, Long Island. Often he himself, along with many in the media, have confused this with him living in neighboring Levittown, NY (formed 1947). In truth, Joel lived on Meeting Lane in Hicksville, a town that has existed since 1648, near the Levittown border, in a section of town where Post-WW2, there were houses developed by Abe Levitt, known as Levitt Houses, thus forming nearby Levittown. His father, Howard Joel, was a Jewish Holocaust survivor from Germany, whose father Karl Amson Joel owned the fourth largest mail order company in Germany before being dispossessed by the Nazis. His mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England, to an agnostic Jewish family. His parents later divorced, and his father moved back to Eastern Europe. His half-brother Alexander Joel is an acclaimed classical pianist and conductor in Europe, now living in New York. \\n\\nFrom an early age Joel had an intense interest in music; especially classical music. He began piano lessons at an early age, and his interest in music instead of sports was the source for much teasing and bullying in his early years. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, but abandoned the sport shortly after having his nose broken in a boxing match.\\n\\nJoel attended Hicksville High School, and was to have graduated in 1967. However, he was one English credit short of the graduation requirement; he overslept on the day of an important exam due to his late-night musician\\'s lifestyle.[citation needed] Faced with a summer in school to complete this requirement, he decided not to continue. He left high school without a diploma to begin a career in music. In 1992, the English credit requirement was waived by the Hicksville School Board and he received his diploma at Hicksville High\\'s graduation ceremony 25 years after he left the school.\\n\\nAt the age of 14 Joel joined his first band, The Echoes (which later became The Lost Souls). According to producer Shadow Morton, Joel was also the pianist on the Shangri-Las hit \"Remember (Walking In The Sand)\". In 1966, he joined The Hassles, a Long Island band that had some local success (\"Every Step I Take,\" \"You Got Me Hummin\\'\"). The Hassles released two albums The Hassles (1967) and Hour of the Wolf (1968) on the United Artists record label. Following The Hassles\\' demise in 1969, he formed the progressive rock duo Attila with Hassles drummer Jon Small. Attila released their eponymous debut album in July 1970 and disbanded the following October.\\n\\nUpon losing his record contract with Attila, Joel suffered severe depression, and was admitted into Meadowbrook Hospital after ingesting furniture polish in a half-hearted suicide attempt. The note he left eventually became the lyrics to his song \"Tomorrow Is Today.\" Upon release from Meadowbrook Hospital in early 1971, he began to re-explore his place in the music business, including the participation in a television commercial with Chubby Checker and the contribution of rock criticism to a music magazine called Changes.\\n\\n*Cold Spring Harbor (1971)\\nJoel signed his first solo record contract with Artie Ripp of Family Productions, and subsequently recorded his first solo album. Cold Spring Harbor (a reference to the Long Island town of the same name), was released in 1971. However, the album was mastered at the wrong speed, and the album was initially released with this error, resulting in Joel sounding a half step too high (Joel later commented that he sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks). The onerous terms of the Family Productions contract also guaranteed him very little money from the sales of his albums.\\n\\nIn order to get out of the deal with Family Productions, Joel moved to Los Angeles, California with Elizabeth Weber, and they married in Los Angeles in May, 1971. For six months of the following year, he played in the Executive Lounge piano bar under the name Bill Martin. This experience is what gave him the material for \"Piano Man.\"\\n\\nIn addition, a Philadelphia radio station, WMMR-FM, started playing a tape of a new song, \"Captain Jack,\" which was taken from a live concert broadcast which became an underground hit on the East Coast. An Executive from Columbia Records named Herb Gordon, heard his music and made his record label aware of Joel\\'s talent. From there he signed with Columbia Records. Hits such as \"She\\'s Got a Way\" and \"Everybody Loves You Now\" were originally released on this album, though they did not gain much attention until released as live performances in 1981 on Songs in the Attic. Since then they have become regular concert numbers. Cold Spring Harbor got a second chance on the charts in 1983, when Columbia reissued the album after slowing it down to the correct speed. The album reached # 158 in the US and # 95 in the UK nearly a year later.\\n\\n*Piano Man (1973)\\nHis experiences in Los Angeles connected him with record company executives, who bought out his contract with Ripp, with the condition that the \"Family Productions\" logo be displayed alongside the Columbia logo for the next five albums. Also in the contract was the agreement that Family Productions would receive a 25 cent royalty for every album Joel sold, which would come back to haunt him when he hit it big. His brief tenure in Los Angeles also inspired his signature song \"Piano Man.\" The album Piano Man was released in late 1973 and was certified Gold. To this day it has sold over four million copies. However, due to the large sums of money involved in the legal tangles of the contract buyout, Joel netted less than $7,000 in profit from his certified Gold record. Although this album is best known for its title track, several other future gems include \"Captain Jack,\" \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" and \"You\\'re My Home\" (the b-side of the \"Piano Man\" single, which would later be covered by Helen Reddy), all of which would become staples of Joel\\'s live shows.\\n\\n*Streetlife Serenade (1974)\\nJoel remained in Los Angeles to write Streetlife Serenade, his second album under the Columbia label. References to both suburbia and the inner city pepper the album. The standout track on the album is \"The Entertainer,\" which picks up thematically where \"Piano Man\" left off. Joel was upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly edited down in order to make it more radio-friendly, and in \"The Entertainer,\" he refers to the edit with sarcastic lines such as, \"If you\\'re gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" This refers to the album version of this song which is 5:37, and the edited single which is 3:05. Although Streetlife Serenade is considered one of Joel\\'s weaker albums (Joel has confirmed his distaste for the album), it still contains some notable tracks including the title track, with its Debussy-like intro, \"Los Angelenos,\" and the instrumental \"The Mexican Connection.\"\\n\\n*Turnstiles (1976)\\nDisenchanted with the LA music scene, Joel returned to New York in 1975. There he recorded what many fans and critics consider one of his best albums, Turnstiles. On Turnstiles, Joel used his own hand-picked musicians in the studio for the first time, and took a more hands-on role. Songs were initially recorded and produced by famed Chicago producer James William Guercio, who subsequently was fired. The songs were re-recorded and Joel took over, producing the album himself. Joel\\'s \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" was a minor hit, echoed the Phil Spector sound, and was even covered by Ronnie Spector. The album also featured the New York anthem, \"New York State of Mind,\" a bluesy, jazzy epic that has become one of Joel\\'s signature songs and was later covered by fellow Columbia labelmate Barbra Streisand on her Streisand Superman album. Other top songs on the album include \"Summer, Highland Falls,\" and \"Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway).\" Songs such as \"Prelude/Angry Young Man\" would become a mainstay of his concerts for years.\\n\\n*The Stranger (1977)\\nFor his album The Stranger, Columbia Records united Joel with producer Phil Ramone. The album yielded four Top 40 hits on the Billboard Charts in the US. Album sales exceeded Columbia\\'s previous top album, Simon & Garfunkel\\'s Bridge Over Troubled Water, and was certified multi-platinum. It was Joel\\'s first Top Ten album, as it rose to # 2 on the charts. Phil Ramone eventually produced every Billy Joel studio release until 1989\\'s Storm Front. The Stranger netted Joel Grammy nominations, for Album of the Year and Song of the Year, for \"Just the Way You Are\", which was written as a gift to his wife Elizabeth and became his highest charting song to date in the United States.\\n\\nIn 2007 \"The Stranger\" was re-released with a bonus disk of a live concert recorded at Carnegie Hall June 3, 1977 that featured mostly songs from his first three albums. One can only guess that the success of \"The Stranger\" and \"52nd Street\" made this live album a bit obsolete for release at the time.\\n\\n*52nd Street (1978)\\nJoel faced high expectations on his next album. 52nd Street was conceived as a day in Manhattan, and was named after the block where Columbia Records\\' office was located. Fans purchased over seven million copies on the strength of the hits \"My Life\", \"Big Shot,\" and \"Honesty.\" This helped 52nd Street become Joel\\'s first # 1 album. \"My Life\" eventually became the theme song for a new US television sitcom, Bosom Buddies, which featured actor Tom Hanks in one of his earliest roles. 52nd Street was the first album to be released on Compact Disc in Japan (1982). The album won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male & Album of the Year. Despite all the cover art for the album showing Joel holding a trumpet, he doesn\\'t play the instrument on the album. The trumpet is only played on one track, \"Zanzibar\", by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.\\n\\n*Glass Houses (1980)\\nJoel in a promotional picture for Glass Houses.The success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Honesty\" never sat well with him. With Glass Houses, Joel attacked the new wave popularity with aplomb. This album yielded such classics as \"You May Be Right\" (# 7, May 1980), \"Close To The Borderline\"(flipside of the \"You May Be Right\" single), \"Don\\'t Ask Me Why\" (# 19, September 1980), \"Sometimes A Fantasy\" (# 36, November 1980) and \"It\\'s Still Rock & Roll to Me,\" which became Joel\\'s first Billboard # 1 song in July, 1980. Glass Houses won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It would also win the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category.\\n\\n*Songs In The Attic (1981)\\nHis next release, Songs In The Attic, was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. Songs In The Attic was recorded during arena and club shows in June and July of 1980. This release introduced many fans, who just discovered Joel when The Stranger became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions.\\n\\n*The Nylon Curtain (1982)\\nThe next wave of Joel\\'s career commenced with the recording of The Nylon Curtain. Considered his most audacious and ambitious album, Joel took more than a page or two from the Lennon-McCartney songwriting style on this heavily Beatles-influenced album.\\nWork began on The Nylon Curtain in the spring of 1982. However, Joel was sidelined when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident. The driver ran a red light and collided with Joel, who was on his motorcycle. His left wrist was broken and his hand badly damaged. Due to surgery, which included the temporary insertion of five pins into his wrist, and a month in the hospital, production of the album was shut down temporarily while Joel recovered. In the meantime, Joel\\'s first video special, Live from Long Island, was recorded at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on December 30, 1982. The Nylon Curtain went to # 7 on the charts, supported by the popular singles \"Allentown\", Goodnight Saigon, and Pressure. Allentown rose to # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982 and the most successful song from The Nylon Curtain album. The album is considered by many of his fans to be the masterpiece of his works. Joel\\'s marriage began to suffer as his success rose, and Joel and wife Elizabeth divorced. In accordance with the divorce agreement, Elizabeth took half of the singer\\'s assets. Following his tour supporting The Nylon Curtain, Joel retreated to the island of St. Bart\\'s for rest and relaxation. At the hotel\\'s bar, he met supermodel Christie Brinkley, who had been divorced from her husband Jean-François Allaux. They eventually became a couple, and married on March 23, 1985.\\n\\n*An Innocent Man (1983) \\nJoel in a promotional picture for An Innocent Man.The song \"Uptown Girl\" was one of the first songs written when Joel returned from vacation. \"Uptown Girl\" was conceived as Joel wondered aloud how the gorgeous Christie Brinkley could wind up with a guy like him. It became a worldwide hit upon its release, and Joel\\'s sole # 1 in the United Kingdom. The resulting album, An Innocent Man, was compiled as a tribute to the doo-wop music of the 1950s, and also resulted in Joel\\'s second Billboard # 1 hit, \"Tell Her About It.\" The album, which reached # 4 on the charts, boasted 6 top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel\\'s catalog. An Innocent Man was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but ultimately lost to Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller.\\n\\n*Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 (1985)\\nFollowing the success of An Innocent Man, Joel had been approached to release an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one\\'s career. This time, he agreed, and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 was released as a 4-sided album and 2-CD set, with the songs in sequence of when they were released. The new songs \"You\\'re Only Human (Second Wind)\" and \"The Night Is Still Young\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album. Greatest Hits was highly successful, selling over 20 million copies worldwide and becoming the top-selling double album of all time by a solo artist (and second overall after The Wall by Pink Floyd). It has since been certified diamond by the RIAA for 10.5 million albums sold (21 million disks). To date it is the 6th best selling album in American music history according to the RIAA.\\n\\nCoinciding with the Greatest Hits album release, Joel released a 2-volume Video Album that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the Greatest Hits album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man,\" for this project. Two versions of Greatest Hits were released on CD: the initial release on double CD in 1985, and a re-released Enhanced CD version in 1998. While both are the same basic album in general, there are a number of subtle differences between the two:\\n\\nWhile all the longer hits (\"Piano Man,\" \"Captain Jack,\" \"Goodnight Saigon\") are fully intact, many other shorter songs (\"Pressure,\" \"Just The Way You Are,\" \"My Life\") were shortened significantly in the 1985 release. Oddly enough, the included booklet lists all of the lyrics, even the parts cut for time. These songs are fully restored in the re-release. The 1985 release features the live version of \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" from Songs in the Attic. The version from Turnstiles was used for the 1998 re-release. \\nThe 1998 re-release features enhanced content due to advancements in CD technology over the previous 13 years. \\n\\n*The Bridge (1986)\\nJoel had already scored a hit with \"Modern Woman\" from the 1985 movie, \"Ruthless People,\" (starring Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Helen Slater and Judge Reinhold), when he began work on the album that would become The Bridge in early 1986. Ray Charles contributed vocals and music to the song \"Baby Grand\" with Joel, and Steve Winwood played Hammond organ on the song \"Getting Closer.\" The final song recorded for the album was \"Code Of Silence.\" Cyndi Lauper appears on the album, contributing backing vocals. Though it broke into the Top Ten, The Bridge was not a success in relation to some of Joel\\'s other albums, but it yielded the hit \"A Matter Of Trust.\" In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in its video as playing a Les Paul-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad \"This Is The Time\" also charted, and has been a favorite on the prom circuit ever since. \"Modern Woman\" was also released as a single and was quite successful, but Joel has since said in interviews he doesn\\'t care for the song, and subsequently it has been left off most of his compilation sets (the exception appears to be My Lives). It was also the last Billy Joel album to carry the \"Family Productions\" logo.\\n\\nAt around this time, Billy completed voice work on Disney\\'s Oliver & Company, released in 1988. A loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist, Billy brought both his acting and musical talents to the film as Dodger. For the film, Billy recorded a song titled \"Why Should I Worry?\" Critics were generally positive towards the film, and pointed to Billy\\'s acting contribution as one of its highlights, despite it being his first acting job. In interviews, Billy explained that he took the job due to his love of Disney cartoons as a child.\\n\\nThroughout his tour supporting The Bridge, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. He would be the first American rock act to play there since the Berlin Wall went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel. There would be six live performances, three each at indoor arenas in Moscow and Leningrad. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in June 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to eventually offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.\\n\\nThe audience in at least the first Moscow shows was filled with members of the Communist Party, who received tickets from the government as a perk. Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel\\'s energetic show, something that never had happened in other countries he had performed in. As a result of that a minor international incident occurred when he famously flipped over an electric keyboard during the second Moscow show as a show of frustration that his lighting engineers would not turn down the house lights to calm the audience despite several requests. The lighting engineers were more concerned with the amount of light being adequate for filming. \\n\\n*КОНЦЕРТ (1987)\\nThe album КОНЦЕРТ, Russian for \"Concert,\" was released in the fall of 1987. Singer Peter Hewlitt was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man.\" It has been estimated that Joel lost over US $1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.\\n\\n* Storm Front (1989)\\nThe song \"We Didn\\'t Start the Fire,\" the first single from the album Storm Front, was released in September 1989. The song became Joel\\'s third US Number 1 hit. Storm Front was released in October, and it eventually became Joel\\'s first Number 1 album since Glass Houses, 9 years earlier. Storm Front was Joel\\'s first album since Turnstiles to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner fame. Joel also brought in some fresh faces to join the band, including talented multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero, who would go on to become Joel\\'s musical director and architect of his live sound. After \"We Didn\\'t Start The Fire,\" Storm Front also produced the hit \"I Go To Extremes.\" The album was also notable for its song \"Leningrad,\" written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city during his tour in 1987, and \"The Downeaster Alexa,\" written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album was the ballad \"And So It Goes.\"\\n\\nIn 1992, Joel sued former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber (ex-wife Elizabeth\\'s brother) for $95 million after accounting irregularities were discovered. The case later settled out of court. \\n\\n*River of Dreams (1993)\\nJoel started work on River of Dreams in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date. The album includes hits such as \"The River of Dreams\", \"All About Soul\", \"The Great Wall of China\", and \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\", written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on \"The Essential Billy Joel\" (2001).\\n\\nIn August 1995, Billy Joel\\'s long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer committed suicide in his Long Island home. Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel\\'s albums from Turnstiles through The Bridge.\\n\\nIn 1999 Joel performed at New York\\'s Madison Square Garden on the eve of the new millennium which at the time was considered to be Joel\\'s last solo concert, The concert (dubbed The Night Of The 2000 Years) ran on close to 4 hours and was later released as 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert\\n\\nIn 2001 Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were written by Billy Joel and performed by Richard Joo. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances. The album topped the classical charts at # 1. On September 21, 2001, Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert.\\n\\nJoel has toured extensively with Elton John on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours. During these shows, the two have played each other\\'s songs and performed duets.\\n\\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, My Lives, which is largely a compilation of demos, B-tracks, and live/alternate versions to hit songs. The compilation also includes the Umixit software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\", \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Keepin\\' The Faith\", and live versions of \"I Go To Extremes\" and \"Movin\\' Out (Anthony\\'s Song)\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the River of Dreams tour is included.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the United States. Having not written any new songs, he featured a sampling of all his songs in his career, including his major hits. His tour includes an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\\n\\nOn June 13, 2006, Joel released \"12 Gardens: Live\", a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during his 2006 tour.\\n\\nThe singer\\'s stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, when he played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena.\\n\\nThe record has consequently earned Joel the only retired number in the arena owned by a non-athlete. The retired number, which was 12, hangs in the rafters along with many others such as hockey great Mark Messier.\\n\\n2006 also saw Billy Joel visit the United Kingdom and Ireland (as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour) for the first time in many years, playing to capacity crowds in Birmingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester, Glasgow, London and Dublin.\\n\\nOn July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in Rome, Italy with the Colosseum as the backdrop, and performed classic hits for hundreds of thousands of fans. Joel performed favorites such as \"New York State of Mind,\" \"Honesty,\" and \"Just the Way You Are.\"\\n\\nWhile introducing one song, the 57-year-old singer joked in shaky Italian, \"This song is as old as the Colosseum.\"\\n\\nOrganizers estimated 500,000 people turned out for the show. The concert was opened by Canadian pop-rocker and songwriter Bryan Adams.\\n\\nBilly Joel will tour South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006.\\n\\nJoel\\'s lyrics have made many references to locations in the New York City metropolitan area, particularly Long Island. For example, the \"Miracle Mile\" line in 1980\\'s \"It\\'s Still Rock & Roll to Me\" refers to the affluent shopping district located on Northern Boulevard in the community of Manhasset and 1980\\'s \"You May Be Right\" references walking through the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn alone as proof of craziness. In his 1973 song \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" he describes a certain \"Billy\" as being from the town of Oyster Bay, the municipality in which the hamlet of Hicksville is located. He has since stated, in the liner notes from his album Songs in the Attic, that this \"Billy\" is not himself, but rather an Oyster Bay bartender.\\n\\nSeveral of Joel\\'s songs have grown out of specific personal experiences, including \"Piano Man,\" which he wrote describing his regular job playing at a Los Angeles piano bar in the early 1970s, and \"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,\" purportedly written about either the Syosset mainstay Christiano\\'s or a similar eatery in New York City\\'s Little Italy. His song \"Vienna\" was supposedly written about a visit to his father in Europe, while \"Big Shot\" was based on a bad date with Mick Jagger\\'s ex-wife Bianca.\\n\\nIn a Playboy interview, Joel indicated that \"Rosalinda\\'s Eyes\" was penned for his mother, Rosalinda, as the song his father should have written for her.\\n\\n\"Only The Good Die Young\" created a bit of a stir within the religious community when it was first released in 1977. Some radio stations even refused to give the song any airtime. It is said that while Joel was doing a show in St. Louis, he had been specifically asked not to perform the song during the show and even received death threats; in response, Joel played it twice. Joel has said about the song that \"the point of the song wasn\\'t so much anti-Catholic as [it was] pro-lust\".\\n\\nHis music reflects influences from many different genres including European classical composers, Aaron Copland, 1950s doo wop, Broadway/Tin Pan Alley, jazz, blues, punk, ska, gospel, pop, and even Russian folk songs, to straight-up rock & roll. This has, in part, led to his broad success over a long period of time, but made him difficult to categorize in popular music today.\\n\\nIn the mid 1970s, the touring and studio lineup of Joel\\'s band stabilized. The main lineup consisted of:\\n\\nBilly Joel - lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, organ, harmonica \\nLiberty DeVitto — drums, percussion \\nDoug Stegmeyer — bass guitar, backing vocals \\nRussell Javors — rhythm guitars, backing vocals \\nDavid Brown — lead guitars \\nRichie Cannata — saxophones, flute, clarinet, organ, percussion, backing vocals \\nThis was also the lineup for Joel\\'s first live album, Songs In The Attic.\\n\\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw significant changes to Joel\\'s band. By the River of Dreams tour the only remaining long standing member of the band was DeVitto on drums. Multi-instrumentalists Crystal Taliefero and Mark Rivera joined and remain in his band to this day. Rivera had taken over the prominent saxophone solo in the song \"New York State of Mind\" that had previously been performed by Cannata (and was re-recorded by Rivera for the Greatest Hits version of the song). The 1993 River of Dreams tour saw the addition of Dave Rosenthal on keyboards who also remains with the band. Tommy Byrnes has become a frequent band member on guitar and was both a musical consultant and band member in the Movin\\' Out musical. For the 2006 tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as drummer. Chuck Burgi (from the Broadway production of Joel\\'s musical \\'Movin\\' Out\\') replaced DeVitto. Richie Cannata returns on saxophones, along with Mark Rivera and Crystal Taliefero, with Cannata again performing the \"New York State Of Mind\" solo.\\n\\n\\nDespite having never graduated from high school, Joel has been presented with multiple honorary doctorates:\\n\\nHonorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Syracuse University\\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University (1991) \\nDoctor from Berklee College of Music (1993) \\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University (1997) \\nDoctor of Music from Southampton College (2000) \\nDoctor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University (2006)[8] \\n\\nJoel was also named MusiCares Person of the Year for 2002, an award given each year at the same time as the Grammy Awards. At the dinner honoring Joel, various artists performed versions of his songs including Nelly Furtado, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Diana Krall, Rob Thomas, and Natalie Cole. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on Oct 15, 2006.\\n\\nIn 2004, Joel married 23 year-old Katie Lee. Lee is a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At the time of the wedding, Joel was 54. Joel\\'s daughter, Alexa Ray, 18, served as maid of honor. Joel\\'s second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. Lee works as a restaurant correspondent for the PBS show, George Hirsch: Living it Up!. In 2006, Katie Lee hosted Bravo\\'s Top Chef.\\n\\nIn 2002 he crashed his car in East Hampton, New York, and soon after entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 2003 Joel crashed his car into a tree in eastern Long Island, and was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. In April 2004, Joel crashed his car into a house on Long Island. In March 2005 Joel checked into a Betty Ford rehabilitation center[12], where he spent 30 days. \\n\\nMovin\\' Out (2002), is a musical based on twenty-four Billy Joel songs which was a smash hit on Broadway from 2002 to 2005 (last Broadway show was on December 11, 2005). Joel was composer, lyricist, and orchestrator; Tony Award for Best Orchestrations. The musical is really a dance performance choreographed by famed choreographer Twyla Tharp, with Joel\\'s songs sung by Michael Cavanaugh. \\n\\nIn 2014, he started a series of concerts at New York City\\'s Madison Square Garden, and vowed to perform monthly as long as demand continued.  He sold out 73 consecutive shows through February 2020, before the record-setting series went on hiatus due to the pandemic.\\n\\nhttp://www.billyjoel.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_de": "William Martin „Billy“ Joel (* 9. Mai 1949 in der Bronx, New York City, New York) ist ein US-amerikanischer Sänger, Pianist und Songschreiber.\n\nBilly Joel wurde am 9. Mai 1949 als zweites Kind von Rosalind und Howard Joel in der New Yorker Bronx geboren und wuchs in Levittown, einem Ortsteil von Hicksville, auf der Insel Long Island im Bundesstaat New York auf.\n\nSeine Mutter wurde als Rosalind Nyman in Großbritannien geboren. Sein Vater kam als Helmut Joel in Nürnberg zur Welt und war der Sohn von Karl Amson Joel, der mit seiner Familie 1938 vom nationalsozialistischen Deutschland in die Emigration gedrängt wurde. 1947 heirateten Billy Joels Eltern, und im selben Jahr kam seine ältere Schwester zur Welt. 1960, als Billy Joel elf Jahre alt war, ließen seine Eltern sich scheiden. Er blieb bei seiner Mutter, während sein Vater nach Europa zurückkehrte und sich in Wien niederließ. Aus der dort geschlossenen zweiten Ehe mit einer Engländerin stammt Joels 1971 geborener Halbbruder, der Dirigent Alexander Joel.\n\n1973 heiratete Joel seine Managerin Elizabeth Weber; die Ehe wurde 1982 geschieden. Von 1985 bis 1994 war er mit Christie Brinkley verheiratet, mit der er die 1985 geborene Tochter Alexa Ray Joel hat. Im Oktober 2004 heiratete der damals 55-jährige Joel die 23-jährige Restaurantkritikerin Katie Lee. Im Juni 2009 gab das Paar seine Trennung bekannt.\n\nSchon als Kind war Billy Joel Liebhaber klassischer Musik und nahm Klavierunterricht. Mit 15 Jahren begann er in Rockbands zu spielen, unter anderem mit der auf Long Island bekannten Gruppe The Hassles, mit der Joel zwischen 1967 und 1968 die zwei LPs The Hassles und Hour of the Wolf aufnahm. Ein Jahr später spielte Billy Joel zusammen mit Jon Small unter dem Namen Attila eine Rockplatte ein. Weiterhin arbeitete er Ende der 1960er als Studiomusiker verschiedener namhafter Künstler wie Chubby Checker und The Shangri-Las und trat unter dem Künstlernamen Billy Martin in Piano-Bars auf. 1970 lernte der Musiker den Musikproduzenten Artie Ripp kennen. Dieser verhalf Joel zu seinem Debütalbum Cold Spring Harbor, dessen kommerzieller Erfolg jedoch ausblieb. Die Masterbänder wurden dabei nach der letzten Abmischung nicht in der richtigen Geschwindigkeit überspielt. Zudem stand Joel nach der Veröffentlichung des Debütalbums im Streit mit seinem bisherigen Plattenlabel Family Productions, von dem sich der Künstler aufgrund der schlechten Vertragssituation trennen wollte. Während sich Joel nach eigenen Angaben wieder unter dem Pseudonym Bill Martin in verschiedenen Bars „versteckte“, versuchte seine neue Agentur Columbia Records den Vertrag mit Family Productions zu lösen, was schließlich 1972 gelang.\n\nZusammen mit Columbia veröffentlichte Joel 1973 das Album Piano Man, in dessen Titelstück er sich mit seiner eigenen Vergangenheit als Barmusiker auseinandersetzt und das so erfolgreich war, dass der Musiker in Anlehnung an den Titel den Spitznamen „Piano Man“ erhielt. Mit seiner zweiten Platte gelangen Joel zudem erste bedeutende Platzierungen in den US-amerikanischen Charts, die beiden Nachfolgealben Streetlife Serenade und Turnstiles konnten jedoch vorerst nicht ganz an den großen Erfolg des Albums und insbesondere der Single Piano Man anknüpfen. Mit dem 1977 erschienenen Studioalbum The Stranger schaffte Joel den großen Durchbruch. Das darauf enthaltene Stück Just the Way You Are wurde bei den Grammy Awards 1979 als „Song des Jahres“ ausgezeichnet, die Platte selbst erreichte Platin-Status. Dieser Erfolg wird auch auf seine Zusammenarbeit mit dem Produzenten Phil Ramone zurückgeführt, die insgesamt fast zehn Jahre andauerte.\n\nDas 1978 veröffentlichte Album 52nd Street war das erste Album des Musikers, das Platz eins der Billboard Album-Charts belegte; Joel erhielt dafür erneut zwei Grammy Awards. 1982 schrieb die Platte zudem Musikgeschichte, als sie als erstes Popalbum des Sony-Katalogs auf dem neuen CD-Format veröffentlicht wurde.\n\nAls erster amerikanischer Rockstar ging Billy Joel 1987 in der Sowjetunion auf Tournee. Die sechsteilige Konzertreihe, die das Live-Album Концерт (russisch: Konzert) hervorbrachte, inspirierte ihn auch zum Titel Leningrad. Für das dazugehörige Album Storm Front aus dem Jahr 1989 trat erstmals Foreigner-Gitarrist Mick Jones an die Stelle von Produzent Ramone. Größter Hit des Albums wurde We Didn’t Start the Fire, dessen Text wichtige Ereignisse, Personen und Gegenstände, der (insbesondere US-)Geschichte zwischen 1949 und 1989 enthält. Dieses Lied belegte Platz eins in den US-Charts und wurde für einen Grammy nominiert.\n\nAuch das vier Jahre später erschienene Album River of Dreams bescherte Joel große Erfolge, darunter erneut vier Grammy-Nominierungen. 1994 begann er zusammen mit Elton John eine gemeinsame Tour unter dem Titel „Face to Face“. In den folgenden Jahren trat Billy Joel hauptsächlich durch Gemeinschaftsprojekte und bei Benefizkonzerten in Erscheinung. Im März 1999 wurde der Künstler in die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame aufgenommen. Am 31. Dezember 1999 trat er im New Yorker Madison Square Garden auf. Das Konzert wurde auf dem Doppel-Album 2000 Millennium Concert veröffentlicht. Darüber hinaus kam es 1998 und 2001 zu Fortsetzungen der „Face to Face Tour“ mit Elton John.\n\n2006 war Joel wieder auf einer Tournee, die ihn am 29. Juni (Hamburg) und 2. Juli 2006 (Frankfurt) zum ersten Mal seit zwölf Jahren für zwei Konzerte auch nach Deutschland führte. Im Rahmen der Tour trat der Musiker zwölf Mal in Folge im ausverkauften Madison Square Garden auf, was vor ihm noch nie jemand erreicht hat. Die zwölf Auftritte sind als Querschnitt im Juni 2006 auf dem Live-Album 12 Gardens veröffentlicht worden. Als Abschluss des Europa-Teils der Tour spielten er und Bryan Adams am 31. Juli 2006 bei einem Gratis-Konzert vor dem Kolosseum in Rom.\n\nAm 7. Februar 2007 erschien mit All My Life nach über zehn Jahren wieder eine neue Single von Joel. Im Dezember des gleichen Jahres wurde mit Christmas in Fallujah ein weiterer neuer Song von ihm veröffentlicht, den er allerdings nicht selbst singt. Das Lied, das sich mit der Situation der amerikanischen Soldaten im Irak befasst und auf deren Korrespondenz mit ihren Familien in der Heimat basiert, sollte nach Auffassung Joels von einem jüngeren Sänger gesungen werden. Als Interpreten wählte er den jungen amerikanischen Songwriter Cass Dillon. 2008 setzte Joel seine Amerika-Tournee fort. Den Höhepunkt stellten zwei Konzerte am 16. und 18. Juli 2008 im New Yorker Shea Stadium dar. Als Gäste konnte er unter anderem Paul McCartney und Steven Tyler begrüßen.\n\nSeit dem 27. Januar 2014 tritt Joel einmal im Monat im Madison Square Garden in New York auf. Die ersten vier Konzerte waren umgehend ausverkauft. Sofern die Nachfrage nach den rund 20.000 Karten weiterhin besteht, wird das Gastspiel über Jahre hinweg stattfinden.",
      "biography_en": "William Martin \"Billy\" Joel (born May 9, 1949, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man\", in 1973, Joel has become the sixth-best-selling recording artist and the third-best-selling solo artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. His compilation album Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2 is the third-best-selling album in the United States by discs shipped.\nJoel had Top 40 hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, achieving 33 Top 40 hits in the United States, all of which he wrote himself. He is also a six-time Grammy Award winner, a 23-time Grammy nominee and one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 150 million records worldwide. He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary, with Billy Joel positioned at No. 23. With the exception of the 2007 songs \"All My Life\" and \"Christmas in Fallujah\", Joel stopped writing and recording popular music after 1993's River of Dreams, but he continued to tour extensively until 2010. Joel was born in the Bronx, May 9, 1949 and raised in Hicksville, New York in a Levitt home. His father, Howard (born Helmuth), was born in Germany, the son of German merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel, who, after the advent of the Nazi regime, emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States. Billy Joel's mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England to Philip and Rebecca Nyman. Both of Joel's parents were Jewish. They divorced in 1960, and his father moved to Vienna, Austria. Billy has a sister, Judith Joel, and a half-brother, Alexander Joel, who is an acclaimed classical conductor in Europe and currently chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig.\nJoel's father was an accomplished classical pianist. Billy reluctantly began piano lessons at an early age, at his mother's insistence; his teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician/songwriter Timothy Ford. His interest in music, rather than sports, was a source of teasing and bullying in his early years. (He has said in interviews that his piano instructor also taught ballet. Her name was Frances Neiman, and she was a Juilliard trained musician. She gave both classical piano and ballet lessons in the studio attached to the rear of her house, leading neighborhood bullies to mistakenly assume that he was learning to dance.) As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning twenty-two bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after breaking his nose in his twenty-fourth boxing match.\nJoel attended Hicksville High School in 1967, but he did not graduate with his class. He had been helping his single mother make ends meet by playing at a piano bar, which interfered with his school attendance. At the end of his senior year, Joel did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, however, Joel decided to immediately begin a career in music. Joel recounted, \"I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'.\" Columbia did, in fact, become the label that eventually signed him. In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board and was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony, 25 years after he had left.",

      "biography_fr": "William Martin Joel, plus connu sous le nom de Billy Joel, est né le 9 mai 1949 dans le quartier du Bronx à New York, est un pianiste, chanteur et compositeur. Il démarre dans la pop music en 1973 avec le disque Piano Man. Musicien de talent, il a gagné pas moins de six Grammy Award durant sa carrière, mise entre parenthèses depuis 1993.\n\nSelon la RIAA, ses albums sont certifiés à hauteur de 79,5 millions d'unités aux États-Unis. Il continue à parcourir le monde pour se produire en public (en particulier avec Elton John) et il compose de la musique classique.\n\nSon titre Leningrad résume en quelques mots son enfance. Il naît en plein milieu de la Guerre froide, du temps de McCarthy (en référence au fort mouvement anticommuniste de l’époque). Il habitait le sud du Bronx, qui était alors un quartier moderne à majorité blanche.\n\nIl a une sœur et un demi-frère.\n\nAprès le Bronx, il déménage avec sa famille pour Long Island, ensuite Levittown et continue pour Hicksville, deux villes de classes ouvrières dans le comté de Nassau. Son père, Howard Joel est un réfugié juif en provenance d’Allemagne. Sa mère, Rosalind Nyman est née en Angleterre de famille juive agnostique. Son père retourne en Europe de l’Est après avoir divorcé de Rosalind. Le demi-frère de Billy s’appelle Alexander et est également musicien.\n\nDurant son enfance, il montre un grand intérêt pour la musique, particulièrement la musique classique. Il prend des leçons de piano depuis un très jeune âge, son intérêt pour la musique classique lui vaudra d'être régulièrement maltraité par les enfants de son âge, plus intéressés par le sport et le rock and roll.\n\nSouvent malmené, Billy décide de suivre des cours de boxe pour pouvoir se défendre. Il boxa un temps, dans le tournoi « golden gloves » mais abandonne rapidement le sport pour se consacrer à sa future carrière musicale.\n\nBilly Joel fréquentait un lycée de Hicksville et devait recevoir son diplôme en 1967. À cette période, il était régulièrement engagé comme musicien professionnel pour donner des concerts et son quota d'heures de sommeil était de fait très réduit. Il arrivait souvent en retard et finalement, lors du décompte des absences, il s'avéra qu'il lui manquait un cours de gymnastique pour pouvoir prétendre à son diplôme. Pour obtenir son papier, il doit fréquenter les cours pendant l'été. Il décide de ne pas s'astreindre à cette obligation et lors d'une interview à un journaliste, il lui dit : « Je ne vais pas à l'université Columbia, je vais à Columbia records ».\n\nIl quitte les bancs d'école pour suivre sa carrière musicale. En 1992, on lui retire l'obligation de suivre des cours de gymnastique. 25 ans après avoir quitté l'université, il obtient son diplôme lors d'une cérémonie à Hicksville.\n\nIl rejoint le groupe The Echoes à l'âge de quatorze ans. Dans les années 1960, il joue en concert avec un groupe de Long Island, les Hassles connaissant un bon succès localement (Every Step I Take, You Got Me Hummin'). Ensuite, il forme le groupe Attila avec le batteur des Hassles, Jon Small. Attila enregistre un seul album. Il existe un LP sorti en 1970 (Epic E 30030) comportant 8 titres :\n    Face A : 1) Wonder woman 2) California flash 3) Revenge is sweet 4) Amplifier fire : Part 1 Godzilla, Part 2 March of the huns ;\n    Face B : 1) Rollin' home 2) Tear this castle down 3) Holy moses 4) Brain invasion.\n\nTous les titres sont composés par William Joel & Jonathan Small. Il obtiendra un bon succès mais le groupe se disloquera peu après. Joel tombe alors en dépression. Souhaitant en finir avec la vie, il est admis au Meadowbrook Hospital après avoir ingéré un produit de polissage pour meubles. Cet épisode malheureux de sa vie est raconté dans sa chanson Tomorrow is Today.\n\nBilly Joel signe sa première chanson avec Artie Ripp et enregistre son premier album solo avec \"Family Productions\". Cold Spring Harbor (en référence à une ville de Long Island du même nom) est enregistré en 1971. L'album sera enregistré à la mauvaise vitesse et l'album vendu avec ce défaut.\n\nLe contrat qui lie Billy Joel avec la \"Family Productions\" ne lui apporte que très peu d'argent provenant de la vente des disques. Joel part pour Los Angeles en Californie avec Elizabeth Weber et joue sous le nom de Bill Martin. En mai 1971, Billy Joel se marie avec Elizabeth. De cette union naîtront des hits tels que She's Got a Way ou encore Everybody Loves You Now enregistré dans l'album Executive Lounge sans avoir réellement de succès. En 1981, lors d'un enregistrement en Live, ces deux hits rejoignent l'album Song in the Attic.\n\nCold Spring Harbor sera réenregistré en 1983 et aura un énorme succès.\n\nSon expérience à Los Angeles le rapproche de Columbia Records, qui obtiendra d'Artie Ripp l'annulation du contrat à la condition que le logo de \"Family Productions\" apparaisse à côté du logo de la Columbia sur les cinq prochains albums, en plus d'une large compensation financière.\n\nSon bref passage à Los Angeles lui inspire la chanson Piano Man et l'album du même nom sera enregistré à la fin 1973. Il s'en vendra plus de 5 millions d'exemplaires. L'annulation du contrat avec Artie Ripp lui coûtera beaucoup d'argent et les ventes de ce disque d'or ne lui rapporteront que 7 000 dollars.\n\nBilly Joel reste à Los Angeles pour écrire Streetlife Serenade, son deuxième album sous le label Columbia. On retrouve des références à la ville et sa banlieue dans l'album. Le titre phare de cet album est The entertainer qui reprend les thèmes de Piano Man. Billy Joel était dérangé par les réarrangements significatifs effectués sur Piano Man pour qu'il passe mieux à la radio, et dans The Entertainer, il crache dans sa soupe avec des paroles sarcastiques comme \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05\" (« Si tu fais un tube, tu devras le couper, pour qu'ils le fassent tenir en 3:05 »).\n\nEn 1976, Billy Joel sort Turnstiles, un titre approprié pour cet album sur les transitions géographiques et professionnelles (turnstiles veut dire tourniquet en anglais). Écrit pour marquer le retour de Billy Joel sur la côte Est après avoir passé trois ans en Californie, le premier titre Say Goodbye to Hollywood montre que Billy Joel prend un nouveau départ. Malgré I've Loved These Days, chanson parlant avec regret d'un Los Angeles du début des années 1970, Turnstiles rend clair le retour de Billy Joel au bercail. En effet, New York State of Mind, une chanson d'amour sur la ville natale de Billy Joel est devenue un classique.\n\nDans Turnstiles, Billy Joel utilise ses propres musiciens dans le studio pour la première fois, et il a plus de contrôle, produisant lui-même son album. Ces prises de risques ont payé, l'album donne beaucoup plus l'impression d'un live que les albums précédents. Néanmoins, la signature de Billy Joel empreinte de cynisme continue de s'exprimer à travers de morceaux tels que Angry Young Man, une chanson qui deviendra un pilier de ses concerts durant des années, en partie grâce à son prélude au piano qui l'introduit.\n\nLa décennie 70 et la seconde moitié de la suivante ont coïncidé avec sa période d'apogée. New York State Of Mind, The Stranger, Just The Way You Are, Honesty, My Life et Uptown Girl sont sans aucun doute ses tubes les plus mémorables.\n\nPour l'album The Stranger, Billy Joel s'associa au producteur Phil Ramone. Quatre titres de ce disque apparurent dans le Top 40 aux États-Unis, les ventes dépassant celles de l'album de Simon et Garfunkel Bridge Over Troubled Water, le titre le mieux vendu auparavant par Columbia Records. Ce fut le premier album de Billy Joel à entrer dans le Top 10, montant jusqu'à la deuxième place des albums les plus vendus à l'époque. Phil Ramone fut reconduit pour produire tous les albums studio de Billy Joel jusqu'à Storm Front sorti en 1989.\n\nThe Stranger permit à Joel de remporter deux Grammy Awards : l'un pour meilleur album, l'autre pour meilleure chanson pour Just the Way You Are, une chanson écrite pour sa femme Elizabeth. Sa chanson \"Vienna\" peut être entendue dans le film 30 ans sinon rien avec Jennifer Garner et Mark Ruffalo...\n\nBilly Joel était attendu au tournant pour son prochain album. 52nd Street représentait une journée passée à Manhattan, et tirait son nom de la rue dans laquelle étaient les bureaux de Columbia Records'. Plus de sept millions d'exemplaires furent vendus, notamment grâce aux succès des titres My Life, Big Shot et Honesty. 52nd Street fut ainsi classé no 1, une première pour Billy Joel. My Life fut choisi comme générique de la sitcom, Bosom Buddies, dans laquelle on peut entre autres retrouver Tom Hanks dans l'un de ses premiers rôles. 52nd Street fut le premier album à sortir en disque compact au Japon en 1982. 52nd Street fut récompensé par 3 Grammy Awards : meilleure performance vocale pop, meilleur artiste masculin et meilleur album.\n\nAprès de nombreuses critiques sur des chansons comme Just The Way You Are,She's Always A Woman ou Honesty, Billy Joel est jugé par de nombreuses critiques comme un « petit rocker ». Trouvant cela injuste et insultant, il décide alors d'enregistrer un album, Glass Houses, afin de prouver qu'il pouvait faire un album plus « rock ».\n\nGlass House est le premier album de Billy Joel à être no 1 dans le Billboard chart. Il y reste pendant six semaines grâce à des titres comme You May Be Right (7e, mai 1980), Don't Ask My Why (19e, septembre 1980), Sometimes A Fantasy (36e, novembre 1980), et surtout It's Still Rock And Roll To Me, qui sera le premier titre de Billy Joel à être no 1 au Billboard chart pendant deux semaines.\n\nIl remporta le Grammy Award de meilleure performance vocale rock, ainsi que le American Music Award de meilleur album pop/rock.\n\nSon album suivant, Songs In The Attic, fut produit à partir de morceaux peu connus de son début de carrière joués en concert. Il fut enregistré pendant une tournée dans des salles et des clubs en juin et juillet 1980.\n\nShe's Got A Way (de l'album Cold Spring Harbor) et Say Goodbye To Hollywood (de l'album Turnstile) seront les seules singles de l'album et auront la 23e et 17e places respectivement dans le Billboard Chart.\n\nThe Nylon Curtain est souvent considéré comme l'album le plus ambitieux de Billy Joel. Il commença à y travailler au printemps 1982 lorsqu'il eut un accident de voiture. Un chauffard ayant grillé un feu rouge percuta Billy Joel alors que celui-ci était à moto. Son poignet gauche fut cassé et sa main sérieusement blessée. À cause des opérations et de la convalescence d'un mois nécessaire, la production de l'album fut interrompue le temps que Billy Joel guérisse.\n\nLe 30 décembre 1982, Billy Joel enregistra son premier concert sur vidéo : Live on Long Island, enregistré au Nassau Coliseum à Uniondale (New York).\n\nLe 20 juillet 1983, Billy Joel et sa femme Elizabeth Weber divorcèrent : Elizabeth obtint alors la moitié de la fortune du chanteur. Pendant ce temps, The Nylon Curtain arriva 7e des meilleures ventes, notamment grâce aux chansons Allentown, Goodnight Saigon et Pressure.\n\nAllentown arriva 17e du Top 100 de l'époque, devenant ainsi l'une des chansons les plus jouées à la radio en 1982.\n\nAprès la fin de sa tournée ayant suivi la sortie de l'album, Joel se retira sur l'île de Saint-Barthélemy pour se reposer. C'est au bar de l'hôtel qu'il rencontra la mannequin Christie Brinkley, qui venait de divorcer. Ils se rapprochèrent, puis finirent par se marier le 23 mars 1985.\n\nLa chanson Uptown Girl fut l'une des premières chansons écrites au retour des vacances de Joel. Uptown Girl a été conçue comme une interrogation à haute voix de Joel sur les raisons qui poussaient la magnifique Christie Brinkley à rester avec un homme comme lui. Cette chanson est devenue un succès mondial dès sa sortie, et fut le seul titre de Joel à avoir été no 1 au Royaume-Uni. L'album résultant, An innocent man, réalisé comme un hommage à la musique \"doo-wop\" des années 1950, fut classé 4e des meilleures ventes au États-Unis et 2e en Angleterre, grâce notamment à la présence de six de ses chansons dans le Top 30 des charts américains qui sont Leave A Tender Moment Alone (27e), Keeping The Faith (18e), The Longest Times (14e), An Innocent Man (10e), Uptown Girl (3e) et, Tell Her About It (1er).\n\nL'album fut également nommé pour le Grammy du meilleur album de l'année, mais il perdit face à Thriller de Michael Jackson.\n\nAprès le succès de An Innocent Man, Joel avait été consulté pour produire un album de ses meilleurs titres. Ce n'était pas la première fois que ce sujet était abordé, mais Joel avait au commencement considéré la réalisation de compilations de ses meilleurs titres comme sonnant la fin de sa carrière. Cette fois, il accepta, et Greatest Hits Vol. 1 et 2 sorti dans un format deux disques deux faces ou 2 CD, avec les chansons dans leur ordre de création. Les nouvelles chansons \"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\" et \"The Night Is Still Young\" ont été enregistrées et diffusées pour soutenir l'album.\n\nGreatest Hits remporta un franc succès, se vendant à plus de vingt millions d'exemplaires dans le monde devenant le double album le plus vendu de tous les temps par un artiste solo, seul The Wall des Pink Floyd ayant fait mieux et le Double Blanc des Beatles. Jusqu'ici c'est le 6e album le plus vendu dans l'histoire américaine de musique selon la RIAA.\n\nCoïncidant avec la sortie de Greatest Hits, Joel sorti une compilation des vidéos promotionnels qu'il avait enregistrées de 1977 à 1985. En plus de vidéos pour accompagner certains morceaux des Greatest Hits, Joel enregistra également un clip de son premier succès : \"Piano Man\".\n\nDeux version de Greatest Hits sortirent en CD : l'une en 1985 et l'autre en 1998. Bien qu'ayant toutes les deux la même trame générale, on peut néanmoins noter quelques légères différences :\n\n    Bien que tous les titres les plus longs soient intacts (comme \"Piano Man\", \"Captain Jack\" ou \"Goodnight Saigon\"), d'autres chansons plus courtes (\"Pressure\", \"Just The Way You Are\" ou encore \"My Life\") ont été raccourcies de manière significative dans la version de 1985. Pourtant, le livret accompagnant l'album liste l'ensemble des paroles, même celles tronquées. Ces chansons sont en version intégrale dans la version de 1998.\n    Dans l'album de 1985, c'est la version live de \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" sur Songs in the Attic qui est utilisée alors que c'est la version de l'album Turnstiles qu'on peut entendre sur la compilation de 1998.\n    La version de 1998 a une qualité de son améliorée, grâce aux progrès technologiques faits depuis la première sortie.\n\nJoel venait de remporter un vif succès avec \"Modern Woman\" de la bande originale du film Y a-t-il quelqu'un pour tuer ma femme ? (Ruthless People) (avec Bette Midler, Danny DeVito et Judge Reinhold) quand il commença à travailler sur l'album The Bridge au début de 1986. Ray Charles apporta sa contribution à la chanson \"Baby Grand\", et Steve Winwood joua de l'orgue sur \"Getting Closer\". Cyndi Lauper a aussi contribué à cet album en faisant partie des chœurs.\n\nBien que faisant partie des 10 albums les plus vendus du moment, The Bridge n'eut pas autant de succès que certains autres albums de Joel. Quelques chansons sortirent néanmoins du lot : la ballade \"This Is The Time\" est un classique des bals de fin d'année, \"Modern Woman\", pourtant considérée par Joel lui-même comme ne méritant pas d'attention, rencontra un vif succès dans sa forme single.\n\nC'est à cette époque que Billy participa au dessin animé de Disney Oliver et Compagnie, sorti en 1988, dans lequel il double le chien Dodger (Roublard en français). Il enregistra également une chanson spécialement pour le film : \"Why Should I Worry?\". Billy expliqua avoir accepté ce rôle par amour pour les films de lorsqu'il était enfant.\n\nPendant la tournée suivant la sortie de The Bridge, Joel et ses musiciens commencèrent à prévoir une tournée dans l'Union soviétique à l'été 1987, une première pour un artiste rock américain depuis la construction du mur de Berlin. Et donc, en juin 1987, six concerts eurent lieu, trois à Moscou et trois à Leningrad, tous filmés et radiodiffusés.\n\nL'album КОНЦЕРТ, \"concert\" en russe, sorti à l'automne 1987. Joel aurait perdu environ 1 million de dollars pour la tournée, mais il déclara ne pas regretter ce déficit au vu de l'hospitalité dont les Russes avaient fait preuve.\n\nLa chanson \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", le premier single de l'album Storm Front, sorti en septembre 1989, et devint rapidement la 3e chanson de Joel numéro 1 aux États-Unis.\n\nStorm Front sorti en octobre 1989, et devint finalement le premier album de Joel à être numéro 1 aux États-Unis depuis Glass Houses, neuf années auparavant. Storm Front fut le premier album depuis Turnstiles à ne pas avoir été enregistré avec Phil Ramone en producteur. Pour cet album, il voulait un nouveau son, et s'entoura donc de Mick Jones du groupe Foreigner et de la musicienne Crystal Taliefero (qui devint finalement sa directrice musicale). Hormis \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", l'album comportait aussi la chanson \"Leningrad\", écrite après une rencontre avec un clown dans la ville soviétique lors de la tournée en URSS.\n\nEn 1992, Joel poursuivit son ancien manager et ex-beau-frère Frank Weber (frère de son ex-femme Elizabeth) pour diverses fraudes de comptabilité. L'affaire fut réglée à l'amiable.\n\nJoel commença à travailler sur River Of Dreams au début de 1993. La couverture de l'album était une peinture de Christie Brinkley représentant chacune des chansons du disque. La chanson éponyme River Of Dreams (In the Middle Of the Night) eut un énorme succès international et fut la dernière de Joel à entrer dans le top 10.\n\nEn août 1995, le bassiste de Billy Joel, Doug Stegmeyer se suicide dans sa maison de Long Island. Stegmeyer avait participé à tous les albums de Joel de Turnstiles à The Bridge.\n\nEn 1999, Joel se produit au Madison Square Garden (New York) à la veille du nouveau millénaire. Le concert dure près de quatre heures et est ensuite commercialisé sous le titre 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert.\n\nEn 2001 sort l'album Fantasies & Delusions, une compilation de morceaux de piano, tous composés par Billy Joel et interprétés par Richard Joo. Joel utilise d'ailleurs souvent des extraits de ces morceaux comme interludes entre ses chansons en concert. L'album est le plus vendu des albums classiques du moment.\n\nJoel effectue de nombreux concerts avec Elton John dans une tournée intitulée \"Face to Face\", durant laquelle les deux chanteurs interprétent, seuls ou en duo, des chansons des deux hommes.\n\nEn 2005, Columbia sort un coffret, My Lives, qui est dans une large mesure une compilation d'inédits, de face-B et de versions live de tubes de Joel. On y trouve le logiciel Umixit, grâce auquel il est possible de remixer avec son PC \"Zanzibar\", \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Keepin' The Faith\", et des versions live de \"I Go To Extremes\" et \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\". Un DVD de la tournée River of Dreams est également inclus.\n\nLe 7 janvier 2006, Joel débute une nouvelle tournée à travers les États-Unis. N'ayant pas écrit de nouvelles chansons, ses concerts reposent sur de nouvelles versions de toutes ses chansons, y compris les tubes. Douze concerts à guichets fermés ont lieu au Madison Square Garden (un record, le précédent tenant du titre étant Bruce Springsteen avec onze concerts), concerts desquels sont extraites les chansons de l'album \"12 Gardens: Live\", sorti en juin 2006. Joel s'arrête aussi au Royaume-Uni et en Irlande pour la première fois depuis de nombreuses années.\n\nLe 4 février 2007 à Miami, Joel devint le premier chanteur à avoir interprété deux fois l'hymne national américain avant la finale du Super Bowl, il avait déjà participé à cet événement en 1989 (à Miami également).\n\nLe 11 mars 2011 sort un double album live intitulé \"Live at the Shea Stadium\".\n\nCe concert est le dernier donné au mythique Shea Stadium de New York en juillet 2008 un mois avant sa démolition.",

      "bio_content": "Billy Joel (born William Martin Joel on May 9, 1949 in Bronx, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man,\" in 1973, Joel has become a multi-million-selling recording artist. Joel recorded many popular hit songs and albums from 1971 until he stopped recording pop/rock music in 1993. He is one of the very few rock (or even pop) artists to have Top 10 hits in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he has sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and is the sixth best selling artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. \n\nJoel's induction into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (Class of 1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Class of 1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) has further solidified his status as one of America's leading music icons. He has continued to tour occasionally (sometimes with Elton John) in addition to writing and recording classical music.\n\nJoel first lived in the South Bronx, in New York City, but his family soon moved to Hicksville, Long Island. Often he himself, along with many in the media, have confused this with him living in neighboring Levittown, NY (formed 1947). In truth, Joel lived on Meeting Lane in Hicksville, a town that has existed since 1648, near the Levittown border, in a section of town where Post-WW2, there were houses developed by Abe Levitt, known as Levitt Houses, thus forming nearby Levittown. His father, Howard Joel, was a Jewish Holocaust survivor from Germany, whose father Karl Amson Joel owned the fourth largest mail order company in Germany before being dispossessed by the Nazis. His mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England, to an agnostic Jewish family. His parents later divorced, and his father moved back to Eastern Europe. His half-brother Alexander Joel is an acclaimed classical pianist and conductor in Europe, now living in New York. \n\nFrom an early age Joel had an intense interest in music; especially classical music. He began piano lessons at an early age, and his interest in music instead of sports was the source for much teasing and bullying in his early years. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, but abandoned the sport shortly after having his nose broken in a boxing match.\n\nJoel attended Hicksville High School, and was to have graduated in 1967. However, he was one English credit short of the graduation requirement; he overslept on the day of an important exam due to his late-night musician's lifestyle.[citation needed] Faced with a summer in school to complete this requirement, he decided not to continue. He left high school without a diploma to begin a career in music. In 1992, the English credit requirement was waived by the Hicksville School Board and he received his diploma at Hicksville High's graduation ceremony 25 years after he left the school.\n\nAt the age of 14 Joel joined his first band, The Echoes (which later became The Lost Souls). According to producer Shadow Morton, Joel was also the pianist on the Shangri-Las hit \"Remember (Walking In The Sand)\". In 1966, he joined The Hassles, a Long Island band that had some local success (\"Every Step I Take,\" \"You Got Me Hummin'\"). The Hassles released two albums The Hassles (1967) and Hour of the Wolf (1968) on the United Artists record label. Following The Hassles' demise in 1969, he formed the progressive rock duo Attila with Hassles drummer Jon Small. Attila released their eponymous debut album in July 1970 and disbanded the following October.\n\nUpon losing his record contract with Attila, Joel suffered severe depression, and was admitted into Meadowbrook Hospital after ingesting furniture polish in a half-hearted suicide attempt. The note he left eventually became the lyrics to his song \"Tomorrow Is Today.\" Upon release from Meadowbrook Hospital in early 1971, he began to re-explore his place in the music business, including the participation in a television commercial with Chubby Checker and the contribution of rock criticism to a music magazine called Changes.\n\n*Cold Spring Harbor (1971)\nJoel signed his first solo record contract with Artie Ripp of Family Productions, and subsequently recorded his first solo album. Cold Spring Harbor (a reference to the Long Island town of the same name), was released in 1971. However, the album was mastered at the wrong speed, and the album was initially released with this error, resulting in Joel sounding a half step too high (Joel later commented that he sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks). The onerous terms of the Family Productions contract also guaranteed him very little money from the sales of his albums.\n\nIn order to get out of the deal with Family Productions, Joel moved to Los Angeles, California with Elizabeth Weber, and they married in Los Angeles in May, 1971. For six months of the following year, he played in the Executive Lounge piano bar under the name Bill Martin. This experience is what gave him the material for \"Piano Man.\"\n\nIn addition, a Philadelphia radio station, WMMR-FM, started playing a tape of a new song, \"Captain Jack,\" which was taken from a live concert broadcast which became an underground hit on the East Coast. An Executive from Columbia Records named Herb Gordon, heard his music and made his record label aware of Joel's talent. From there he signed with Columbia Records. Hits such as \"She's Got a Way\" and \"Everybody Loves You Now\" were originally released on this album, though they did not gain much attention until released as live performances in 1981 on Songs in the Attic. Since then they have become regular concert numbers. Cold Spring Harbor got a second chance on the charts in 1983, when Columbia reissued the album after slowing it down to the correct speed. The album reached # 158 in the US and # 95 in the UK nearly a year later.\n\n*Piano Man (1973)\nHis experiences in Los Angeles connected him with record company executives, who bought out his contract with Ripp, with the condition that the \"Family Productions\" logo be displayed alongside the Columbia logo for the next five albums. Also in the contract was the agreement that Family Productions would receive a 25 cent royalty for every album Joel sold, which would come back to haunt him when he hit it big. His brief tenure in Los Angeles also inspired his signature song \"Piano Man.\" The album Piano Man was released in late 1973 and was certified Gold. To this day it has sold over four million copies. However, due to the large sums of money involved in the legal tangles of the contract buyout, Joel netted less than $7,000 in profit from his certified Gold record. Although this album is best known for its title track, several other future gems include \"Captain Jack,\" \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" and \"You're My Home\" (the b-side of the \"Piano Man\" single, which would later be covered by Helen Reddy), all of which would become staples of Joel's live shows.\n\n*Streetlife Serenade (1974)\nJoel remained in Los Angeles to write Streetlife Serenade, his second album under the Columbia label. References to both suburbia and the inner city pepper the album. The standout track on the album is \"The Entertainer,\" which picks up thematically where \"Piano Man\" left off. Joel was upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly edited down in order to make it more radio-friendly, and in \"The Entertainer,\" he refers to the edit with sarcastic lines such as, \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" This refers to the album version of this song which is 5:37, and the edited single which is 3:05. Although Streetlife Serenade is considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel has confirmed his distaste for the album), it still contains some notable tracks including the title track, with its Debussy-like intro, \"Los Angelenos,\" and the instrumental \"The Mexican Connection.\"\n\n*Turnstiles (1976)\nDisenchanted with the LA music scene, Joel returned to New York in 1975. There he recorded what many fans and critics consider one of his best albums, Turnstiles. On Turnstiles, Joel used his own hand-picked musicians in the studio for the first time, and took a more hands-on role. Songs were initially recorded and produced by famed Chicago producer James William Guercio, who subsequently was fired. The songs were re-recorded and Joel took over, producing the album himself. Joel's \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" was a minor hit, echoed the Phil Spector sound, and was even covered by Ronnie Spector. The album also featured the New York anthem, \"New York State of Mind,\" a bluesy, jazzy epic that has become one of Joel's signature songs and was later covered by fellow Columbia labelmate Barbra Streisand on her Streisand Superman album. Other top songs on the album include \"Summer, Highland Falls,\" and \"Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway).\" Songs such as \"Prelude/Angry Young Man\" would become a mainstay of his concerts for years.\n\n*The Stranger (1977)\nFor his album The Stranger, Columbia Records united Joel with producer Phil Ramone. The album yielded four Top 40 hits on the Billboard Charts in the US. Album sales exceeded Columbia's previous top album, Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, and was certified multi-platinum. It was Joel's first Top Ten album, as it rose to # 2 on the charts. Phil Ramone eventually produced every Billy Joel studio release until 1989's Storm Front. The Stranger netted Joel Grammy nominations, for Album of the Year and Song of the Year, for \"Just the Way You Are\", which was written as a gift to his wife Elizabeth and became his highest charting song to date in the United States.\n\nIn 2007 \"The Stranger\" was re-released with a bonus disk of a live concert recorded at Carnegie Hall June 3, 1977 that featured mostly songs from his first three albums. One can only guess that the success of \"The Stranger\" and \"52nd Street\" made this live album a bit obsolete for release at the time.\n\n*52nd Street (1978)\nJoel faced high expectations on his next album. 52nd Street was conceived as a day in Manhattan, and was named after the block where Columbia Records' office was located. Fans purchased over seven million copies on the strength of the hits \"My Life\", \"Big Shot,\" and \"Honesty.\" This helped 52nd Street become Joel's first # 1 album. \"My Life\" eventually became the theme song for a new US television sitcom, Bosom Buddies, which featured actor Tom Hanks in one of his earliest roles. 52nd Street was the first album to be released on Compact Disc in Japan (1982). The album won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male & Album of the Year. Despite all the cover art for the album showing Joel holding a trumpet, he doesn't play the instrument on the album. The trumpet is only played on one track, \"Zanzibar\", by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.\n\n*Glass Houses (1980)\nJoel in a promotional picture for Glass Houses.The success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Honesty\" never sat well with him. With Glass Houses, Joel attacked the new wave popularity with aplomb. This album yielded such classics as \"You May Be Right\" (# 7, May 1980), \"Close To The Borderline\"(flipside of the \"You May Be Right\" single), \"Don't Ask Me Why\" (# 19, September 1980), \"Sometimes A Fantasy\" (# 36, November 1980) and \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me,\" which became Joel's first Billboard # 1 song in July, 1980. Glass Houses won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It would also win the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category.\n\n*Songs In The Attic (1981)\nHis next release, Songs In The Attic, was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. Songs In The Attic was recorded during arena and club shows in June and July of 1980. This release introduced many fans, who just discovered Joel when The Stranger became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions.\n\n*The Nylon Curtain (1982)\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of The Nylon Curtain. Considered his most audacious and ambitious album, Joel took more than a page or two from the Lennon-McCartney songwriting style on this heavily Beatles-influenced album.\nWork began on The Nylon Curtain in the spring of 1982. However, Joel was sidelined when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident. The driver ran a red light and collided with Joel, who was on his motorcycle. His left wrist was broken and his hand badly damaged. Due to surgery, which included the temporary insertion of five pins into his wrist, and a month in the hospital, production of the album was shut down temporarily while Joel recovered. In the meantime, Joel's first video special, Live from Long Island, was recorded at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on December 30, 1982. The Nylon Curtain went to # 7 on the charts, supported by the popular singles \"Allentown\", Goodnight Saigon, and Pressure. Allentown rose to # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982 and the most successful song from The Nylon Curtain album. The album is considered by many of his fans to be the masterpiece of his works. Joel's marriage began to suffer as his success rose, and Joel and wife Elizabeth divorced. In accordance with the divorce agreement, Elizabeth took half of the singer's assets. Following his tour supporting The Nylon Curtain, Joel retreated to the island of St. Bart's for rest and relaxation. At the hotel's bar, he met supermodel Christie Brinkley, who had been divorced from her husband Jean-François Allaux. They eventually became a couple, and married on March 23, 1985.\n\n*An Innocent Man (1983) \nJoel in a promotional picture for An Innocent Man.The song \"Uptown Girl\" was one of the first songs written when Joel returned from vacation. \"Uptown Girl\" was conceived as Joel wondered aloud how the gorgeous Christie Brinkley could wind up with a guy like him. It became a worldwide hit upon its release, and Joel's sole # 1 in the United Kingdom. The resulting album, An Innocent Man, was compiled as a tribute to the doo-wop music of the 1950s, and also resulted in Joel's second Billboard # 1 hit, \"Tell Her About It.\" The album, which reached # 4 on the charts, boasted 6 top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. An Innocent Man was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but ultimately lost to Michael Jackson's Thriller.\n\n*Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 (1985)\nFollowing the success of An Innocent Man, Joel had been approached to release an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time, he agreed, and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 was released as a 4-sided album and 2-CD set, with the songs in sequence of when they were released. The new songs \"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\" and \"The Night Is Still Young\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album. Greatest Hits was highly successful, selling over 20 million copies worldwide and becoming the top-selling double album of all time by a solo artist (and second overall after The Wall by Pink Floyd). It has since been certified diamond by the RIAA for 10.5 million albums sold (21 million disks). To date it is the 6th best selling album in American music history according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the Greatest Hits album release, Joel released a 2-volume Video Album that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the Greatest Hits album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man,\" for this project. Two versions of Greatest Hits were released on CD: the initial release on double CD in 1985, and a re-released Enhanced CD version in 1998. While both are the same basic album in general, there are a number of subtle differences between the two:\n\nWhile all the longer hits (\"Piano Man,\" \"Captain Jack,\" \"Goodnight Saigon\") are fully intact, many other shorter songs (\"Pressure,\" \"Just The Way You Are,\" \"My Life\") were shortened significantly in the 1985 release. Oddly enough, the included booklet lists all of the lyrics, even the parts cut for time. These songs are fully restored in the re-release. The 1985 release features the live version of \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" from Songs in the Attic. The version from Turnstiles was used for the 1998 re-release. \nThe 1998 re-release features enhanced content due to advancements in CD technology over the previous 13 years. \n\n*The Bridge (1986)\nJoel had already scored a hit with \"Modern Woman\" from the 1985 movie, \"Ruthless People,\" (starring Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Helen Slater and Judge Reinhold), when he began work on the album that would become The Bridge in early 1986. Ray Charles contributed vocals and music to the song \"Baby Grand\" with Joel, and Steve Winwood played Hammond organ on the song \"Getting Closer.\" The final song recorded for the album was \"Code Of Silence.\" Cyndi Lauper appears on the album, contributing backing vocals. Though it broke into the Top Ten, The Bridge was not a success in relation to some of Joel's other albums, but it yielded the hit \"A Matter Of Trust.\" In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in its video as playing a Les Paul-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad \"This Is The Time\" also charted, and has been a favorite on the prom circuit ever since. \"Modern Woman\" was also released as a single and was quite successful, but Joel has since said in interviews he doesn't care for the song, and subsequently it has been left off most of his compilation sets (the exception appears to be My Lives). It was also the last Billy Joel album to carry the \"Family Productions\" logo.\n\nAt around this time, Billy completed voice work on Disney's Oliver & Company, released in 1988. A loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist, Billy brought both his acting and musical talents to the film as Dodger. For the film, Billy recorded a song titled \"Why Should I Worry?\" Critics were generally positive towards the film, and pointed to Billy's acting contribution as one of its highlights, despite it being his first acting job. In interviews, Billy explained that he took the job due to his love of Disney cartoons as a child.\n\nThroughout his tour supporting The Bridge, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. He would be the first American rock act to play there since the Berlin Wall went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel. There would be six live performances, three each at indoor arenas in Moscow and Leningrad. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in June 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to eventually offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.\n\nThe audience in at least the first Moscow shows was filled with members of the Communist Party, who received tickets from the government as a perk. Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that never had happened in other countries he had performed in. As a result of that a minor international incident occurred when he famously flipped over an electric keyboard during the second Moscow show as a show of frustration that his lighting engineers would not turn down the house lights to calm the audience despite several requests. The lighting engineers were more concerned with the amount of light being adequate for filming. \n\n*КОНЦЕРТ (1987)\nThe album КОНЦЕРТ, Russian for \"Concert,\" was released in the fall of 1987. Singer Peter Hewlitt was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man.\" It has been estimated that Joel lost over US $1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.\n\n* Storm Front (1989)\nThe song \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" the first single from the album Storm Front, was released in September 1989. The song became Joel's third US Number 1 hit. Storm Front was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first Number 1 album since Glass Houses, 9 years earlier. Storm Front was Joel's first album since Turnstiles to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner fame. Joel also brought in some fresh faces to join the band, including talented multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero, who would go on to become Joel's musical director and architect of his live sound. After \"We Didn't Start The Fire,\" Storm Front also produced the hit \"I Go To Extremes.\" The album was also notable for its song \"Leningrad,\" written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city during his tour in 1987, and \"The Downeaster Alexa,\" written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album was the ballad \"And So It Goes.\"\n\nIn 1992, Joel sued former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber (ex-wife Elizabeth's brother) for $95 million after accounting irregularities were discovered. The case later settled out of court. \n\n*River of Dreams (1993)\nJoel started work on River of Dreams in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date. The album includes hits such as \"The River of Dreams\", \"All About Soul\", \"The Great Wall of China\", and \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\", written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on \"The Essential Billy Joel\" (2001).\n\nIn August 1995, Billy Joel's long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer committed suicide in his Long Island home. Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel's albums from Turnstiles through The Bridge.\n\nIn 1999 Joel performed at New York's Madison Square Garden on the eve of the new millennium which at the time was considered to be Joel's last solo concert, The concert (dubbed The Night Of The 2000 Years) ran on close to 4 hours and was later released as 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert\n\nIn 2001 Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were written by Billy Joel and performed by Richard Joo. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances. The album topped the classical charts at # 1. On September 21, 2001, Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert.\n\nJoel has toured extensively with Elton John on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours. During these shows, the two have played each other's songs and performed duets.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, My Lives, which is largely a compilation of demos, B-tracks, and live/alternate versions to hit songs. The compilation also includes the Umixit software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\", \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Keepin' The Faith\", and live versions of \"I Go To Extremes\" and \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the River of Dreams tour is included.\n\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the United States. Having not written any new songs, he featured a sampling of all his songs in his career, including his major hits. His tour includes an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Joel released \"12 Gardens: Live\", a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during his 2006 tour.\n\nThe singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, when he played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena.\n\nThe record has consequently earned Joel the only retired number in the arena owned by a non-athlete. The retired number, which was 12, hangs in the rafters along with many others such as hockey great Mark Messier.\n\n2006 also saw Billy Joel visit the United Kingdom and Ireland (as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour) for the first time in many years, playing to capacity crowds in Birmingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester, Glasgow, London and Dublin.\n\nOn July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in Rome, Italy with the Colosseum as the backdrop, and performed classic hits for hundreds of thousands of fans. Joel performed favorites such as \"New York State of Mind,\" \"Honesty,\" and \"Just the Way You Are.\"\n\nWhile introducing one song, the 57-year-old singer joked in shaky Italian, \"This song is as old as the Colosseum.\"\n\nOrganizers estimated 500,000 people turned out for the show. The concert was opened by Canadian pop-rocker and songwriter Bryan Adams.\n\nBilly Joel will tour South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006.\n\nJoel's lyrics have made many references to locations in the New York City metropolitan area, particularly Long Island. For example, the \"Miracle Mile\" line in 1980's \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" refers to the affluent shopping district located on Northern Boulevard in the community of Manhasset and 1980's \"You May Be Right\" references walking through the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn alone as proof of craziness. In his 1973 song \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" he describes a certain \"Billy\" as being from the town of Oyster Bay, the municipality in which the hamlet of Hicksville is located. He has since stated, in the liner notes from his album Songs in the Attic, that this \"Billy\" is not himself, but rather an Oyster Bay bartender.\n\nSeveral of Joel's songs have grown out of specific personal experiences, including \"Piano Man,\" which he wrote describing his regular job playing at a Los Angeles piano bar in the early 1970s, and \"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,\" purportedly written about either the Syosset mainstay Christiano's or a similar eatery in New York City's Little Italy. His song \"Vienna\" was supposedly written about a visit to his father in Europe, while \"Big Shot\" was based on a bad date with Mick Jagger's ex-wife Bianca.\n\nIn a Playboy interview, Joel indicated that \"Rosalinda's Eyes\" was penned for his mother, Rosalinda, as the song his father should have written for her.\n\n\"Only The Good Die Young\" created a bit of a stir within the religious community when it was first released in 1977. Some radio stations even refused to give the song any airtime. It is said that while Joel was doing a show in St. Louis, he had been specifically asked not to perform the song during the show and even received death threats; in response, Joel played it twice. Joel has said about the song that \"the point of the song wasn't so much anti-Catholic as [it was] pro-lust\".\n\nHis music reflects influences from many different genres including European classical composers, Aaron Copland, 1950s doo wop, Broadway/Tin Pan Alley, jazz, blues, punk, ska, gospel, pop, and even Russian folk songs, to straight-up rock & roll. This has, in part, led to his broad success over a long period of time, but made him difficult to categorize in popular music today.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, the touring and studio lineup of Joel's band stabilized. The main lineup consisted of:\n\nBilly Joel - lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, organ, harmonica \nLiberty DeVitto — drums, percussion \nDoug Stegmeyer — bass guitar, backing vocals \nRussell Javors — rhythm guitars, backing vocals \nDavid Brown — lead guitars \nRichie Cannata — saxophones, flute, clarinet, organ, percussion, backing vocals \nThis was also the lineup for Joel's first live album, Songs In The Attic.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw significant changes to Joel's band. By the River of Dreams tour the only remaining long standing member of the band was DeVitto on drums. Multi-instrumentalists Crystal Taliefero and Mark Rivera joined and remain in his band to this day. Rivera had taken over the prominent saxophone solo in the song \"New York State of Mind\" that had previously been performed by Cannata (and was re-recorded by Rivera for the Greatest Hits version of the song). The 1993 River of Dreams tour saw the addition of Dave Rosenthal on keyboards who also remains with the band. Tommy Byrnes has become a frequent band member on guitar and was both a musical consultant and band member in the Movin' Out musical. For the 2006 tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as drummer. Chuck Burgi (from the Broadway production of Joel's musical 'Movin' Out') replaced DeVitto. Richie Cannata returns on saxophones, along with Mark Rivera and Crystal Taliefero, with Cannata again performing the \"New York State Of Mind\" solo.\n\n\nDespite having never graduated from high school, Joel has been presented with multiple honorary doctorates:\n\nHonorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Syracuse University\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University (1991) \nDoctor from Berklee College of Music (1993) \nDoctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University (1997) \nDoctor of Music from Southampton College (2000) \nDoctor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University (2006)[8] \n\nJoel was also named MusiCares Person of the Year for 2002, an award given each year at the same time as the Grammy Awards. At the dinner honoring Joel, various artists performed versions of his songs including Nelly Furtado, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Diana Krall, Rob Thomas, and Natalie Cole. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on Oct 15, 2006.\n\nIn 2004, Joel married 23 year-old Katie Lee. Lee is a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At the time of the wedding, Joel was 54. Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray, 18, served as maid of honor. Joel's second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. Lee works as a restaurant correspondent for the PBS show, George Hirsch: Living it Up!. In 2006, Katie Lee hosted Bravo's Top Chef.\n\nIn 2002 he crashed his car in East Hampton, New York, and soon after entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 2003 Joel crashed his car into a tree in eastern Long Island, and was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. In April 2004, Joel crashed his car into a house on Long Island. In March 2005 Joel checked into a Betty Ford rehabilitation center[12], where he spent 30 days. \n\nMovin' Out (2002), is a musical based on twenty-four Billy Joel songs which was a smash hit on Broadway from 2002 to 2005 (last Broadway show was on December 11, 2005). Joel was composer, lyricist, and orchestrator; Tony Award for Best Orchestrations. The musical is really a dance performance choreographed by famed choreographer Twyla Tharp, with Joel's songs sung by Michael Cavanaugh. \n\nIn 2014, he started a series of concerts at New York City's Madison Square Garden, and vowed to perform monthly as long as demand continued.  He sold out 73 consecutive shows through February 2020, before the record-setting series went on hiatus due to the pandemic.\n\nhttp://www.billyjoel.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_de": "William Martin „Billy“ Joel (* 9. Mai 1949 in der Bronx, New York City, New York) ist ein US-amerikanischer Sänger, Pianist und Songschreiber.\n\nBilly Joel wurde am 9. Mai 1949 als zweites Kind von Rosalind und Howard Joel in der New Yorker Bronx geboren und wuchs in Levittown, einem Ortsteil von Hicksville, auf der Insel Long Island im Bundesstaat New York auf.\n\nSeine Mutter wurde als Rosalind Nyman in Großbritannien geboren. Sein Vater kam als Helmut Joel in Nürnberg zur Welt und war der Sohn von Karl Amson Joel, der mit seiner Familie 1938 vom nationalsozialistischen Deutschland in die Emigration gedrängt wurde. 1947 heirateten Billy Joels Eltern, und im selben Jahr kam seine ältere Schwester zur Welt. 1960, als Billy Joel elf Jahre alt war, ließen seine Eltern sich scheiden. Er blieb bei seiner Mutter, während sein Vater nach Europa zurückkehrte und sich in Wien niederließ. Aus der dort geschlossenen zweiten Ehe mit einer Engländerin stammt Joels 1971 geborener Halbbruder, der Dirigent Alexander Joel.\n\n1973 heiratete Joel seine Managerin Elizabeth Weber; die Ehe wurde 1982 geschieden. Von 1985 bis 1994 war er mit Christie Brinkley verheiratet, mit der er die 1985 geborene Tochter Alexa Ray Joel hat. Im Oktober 2004 heiratete der damals 55-jährige Joel die 23-jährige Restaurantkritikerin Katie Lee. Im Juni 2009 gab das Paar seine Trennung bekannt.\n\nSchon als Kind war Billy Joel Liebhaber klassischer Musik und nahm Klavierunterricht. Mit 15 Jahren begann er in Rockbands zu spielen, unter anderem mit der auf Long Island bekannten Gruppe The Hassles, mit der Joel zwischen 1967 und 1968 die zwei LPs The Hassles und Hour of the Wolf aufnahm. Ein Jahr später spielte Billy Joel zusammen mit Jon Small unter dem Namen Attila eine Rockplatte ein. Weiterhin arbeitete er Ende der 1960er als Studiomusiker verschiedener namhafter Künstler wie Chubby Checker und The Shangri-Las und trat unter dem Künstlernamen Billy Martin in Piano-Bars auf. 1970 lernte der Musiker den Musikproduzenten Artie Ripp kennen. Dieser verhalf Joel zu seinem Debütalbum Cold Spring Harbor, dessen kommerzieller Erfolg jedoch ausblieb. Die Masterbänder wurden dabei nach der letzten Abmischung nicht in der richtigen Geschwindigkeit überspielt. Zudem stand Joel nach der Veröffentlichung des Debütalbums im Streit mit seinem bisherigen Plattenlabel Family Productions, von dem sich der Künstler aufgrund der schlechten Vertragssituation trennen wollte. Während sich Joel nach eigenen Angaben wieder unter dem Pseudonym Bill Martin in verschiedenen Bars „versteckte“, versuchte seine neue Agentur Columbia Records den Vertrag mit Family Productions zu lösen, was schließlich 1972 gelang.\n\nZusammen mit Columbia veröffentlichte Joel 1973 das Album Piano Man, in dessen Titelstück er sich mit seiner eigenen Vergangenheit als Barmusiker auseinandersetzt und das so erfolgreich war, dass der Musiker in Anlehnung an den Titel den Spitznamen „Piano Man“ erhielt. Mit seiner zweiten Platte gelangen Joel zudem erste bedeutende Platzierungen in den US-amerikanischen Charts, die beiden Nachfolgealben Streetlife Serenade und Turnstiles konnten jedoch vorerst nicht ganz an den großen Erfolg des Albums und insbesondere der Single Piano Man anknüpfen. Mit dem 1977 erschienenen Studioalbum The Stranger schaffte Joel den großen Durchbruch. Das darauf enthaltene Stück Just the Way You Are wurde bei den Grammy Awards 1979 als „Song des Jahres“ ausgezeichnet, die Platte selbst erreichte Platin-Status. Dieser Erfolg wird auch auf seine Zusammenarbeit mit dem Produzenten Phil Ramone zurückgeführt, die insgesamt fast zehn Jahre andauerte.\n\nDas 1978 veröffentlichte Album 52nd Street war das erste Album des Musikers, das Platz eins der Billboard Album-Charts belegte; Joel erhielt dafür erneut zwei Grammy Awards. 1982 schrieb die Platte zudem Musikgeschichte, als sie als erstes Popalbum des Sony-Katalogs auf dem neuen CD-Format veröffentlicht wurde.\n\nAls erster amerikanischer Rockstar ging Billy Joel 1987 in der Sowjetunion auf Tournee. Die sechsteilige Konzertreihe, die das Live-Album Концерт (russisch: Konzert) hervorbrachte, inspirierte ihn auch zum Titel Leningrad. Für das dazugehörige Album Storm Front aus dem Jahr 1989 trat erstmals Foreigner-Gitarrist Mick Jones an die Stelle von Produzent Ramone. Größter Hit des Albums wurde We Didn’t Start the Fire, dessen Text wichtige Ereignisse, Personen und Gegenstände, der (insbesondere US-)Geschichte zwischen 1949 und 1989 enthält. Dieses Lied belegte Platz eins in den US-Charts und wurde für einen Grammy nominiert.\n\nAuch das vier Jahre später erschienene Album River of Dreams bescherte Joel große Erfolge, darunter erneut vier Grammy-Nominierungen. 1994 begann er zusammen mit Elton John eine gemeinsame Tour unter dem Titel „Face to Face“. In den folgenden Jahren trat Billy Joel hauptsächlich durch Gemeinschaftsprojekte und bei Benefizkonzerten in Erscheinung. Im März 1999 wurde der Künstler in die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame aufgenommen. Am 31. Dezember 1999 trat er im New Yorker Madison Square Garden auf. Das Konzert wurde auf dem Doppel-Album 2000 Millennium Concert veröffentlicht. Darüber hinaus kam es 1998 und 2001 zu Fortsetzungen der „Face to Face Tour“ mit Elton John.\n\n2006 war Joel wieder auf einer Tournee, die ihn am 29. Juni (Hamburg) und 2. Juli 2006 (Frankfurt) zum ersten Mal seit zwölf Jahren für zwei Konzerte auch nach Deutschland führte. Im Rahmen der Tour trat der Musiker zwölf Mal in Folge im ausverkauften Madison Square Garden auf, was vor ihm noch nie jemand erreicht hat. Die zwölf Auftritte sind als Querschnitt im Juni 2006 auf dem Live-Album 12 Gardens veröffentlicht worden. Als Abschluss des Europa-Teils der Tour spielten er und Bryan Adams am 31. Juli 2006 bei einem Gratis-Konzert vor dem Kolosseum in Rom.\n\nAm 7. Februar 2007 erschien mit All My Life nach über zehn Jahren wieder eine neue Single von Joel. Im Dezember des gleichen Jahres wurde mit Christmas in Fallujah ein weiterer neuer Song von ihm veröffentlicht, den er allerdings nicht selbst singt. Das Lied, das sich mit der Situation der amerikanischen Soldaten im Irak befasst und auf deren Korrespondenz mit ihren Familien in der Heimat basiert, sollte nach Auffassung Joels von einem jüngeren Sänger gesungen werden. Als Interpreten wählte er den jungen amerikanischen Songwriter Cass Dillon. 2008 setzte Joel seine Amerika-Tournee fort. Den Höhepunkt stellten zwei Konzerte am 16. und 18. Juli 2008 im New Yorker Shea Stadium dar. Als Gäste konnte er unter anderem Paul McCartney und Steven Tyler begrüßen.\n\nSeit dem 27. Januar 2014 tritt Joel einmal im Monat im Madison Square Garden in New York auf. Die ersten vier Konzerte waren umgehend ausverkauft. Sofern die Nachfrage nach den rund 20.000 Karten weiterhin besteht, wird das Gastspiel über Jahre hinweg stattfinden.",
      "biography_en": "William Martin \"Billy\" Joel (born May 9, 1949, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man\", in 1973, Joel has become the sixth-best-selling recording artist and the third-best-selling solo artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. His compilation album Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2 is the third-best-selling album in the United States by discs shipped.\nJoel had Top 40 hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, achieving 33 Top 40 hits in the United States, all of which he wrote himself. He is also a six-time Grammy Award winner, a 23-time Grammy nominee and one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 150 million records worldwide. He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary, with Billy Joel positioned at No. 23. With the exception of the 2007 songs \"All My Life\" and \"Christmas in Fallujah\", Joel stopped writing and recording popular music after 1993's River of Dreams, but he continued to tour extensively until 2010. Joel was born in the Bronx, May 9, 1949 and raised in Hicksville, New York in a Levitt home. His father, Howard (born Helmuth), was born in Germany, the son of German merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel, who, after the advent of the Nazi regime, emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States. Billy Joel's mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England to Philip and Rebecca Nyman. Both of Joel's parents were Jewish. They divorced in 1960, and his father moved to Vienna, Austria. Billy has a sister, Judith Joel, and a half-brother, Alexander Joel, who is an acclaimed classical conductor in Europe and currently chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig.\nJoel's father was an accomplished classical pianist. Billy reluctantly began piano lessons at an early age, at his mother's insistence; his teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician/songwriter Timothy Ford. His interest in music, rather than sports, was a source of teasing and bullying in his early years. (He has said in interviews that his piano instructor also taught ballet. Her name was Frances Neiman, and she was a Juilliard trained musician. She gave both classical piano and ballet lessons in the studio attached to the rear of her house, leading neighborhood bullies to mistakenly assume that he was learning to dance.) As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning twenty-two bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after breaking his nose in his twenty-fourth boxing match.\nJoel attended Hicksville High School in 1967, but he did not graduate with his class. He had been helping his single mother make ends meet by playing at a piano bar, which interfered with his school attendance. At the end of his senior year, Joel did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, however, Joel decided to immediately begin a career in music. Joel recounted, \"I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'.\" Columbia did, in fact, become the label that eventually signed him. In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board and was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony, 25 years after he had left.",

Il habitait le sud du Bronx, qui était alors un quartier moderne à majorité blanche.\n\nIl a une sœur et un demi-frère.\n\nAprès le Bronx, il déménage avec sa famille pour Long Island, ensuite Levittown et continue pour Hicksville, deux villes de classes ouvrières dans le comté de Nassau. Son père, Howard Joel est un réfugié juif en provenance d’Allemagne. Sa mère, Rosalind Nyman est née en Angleterre de famille juive agnostique. Son père retourne en Europe de l’Est après avoir divorcé de Rosalind. Le demi-frère de Billy s’appelle Alexander et est également musicien.\n\nDurant son enfance, il montre un grand intérêt pour la musique, particulièrement la musique classique. Il prend des leçons de piano depuis un très jeune âge, son intérêt pour la musique classique lui vaudra d'être régulièrement maltraité par les enfants de son âge, plus intéressés par le sport et le rock and roll.\n\nSouvent malmené, Billy décide de suivre des cours de boxe pour pouvoir se défendre. Il boxa un temps, dans le tournoi « golden gloves » mais abandonne rapidement le sport pour se consacrer à sa future carrière musicale.\n\nBilly Joel fréquentait un lycée de Hicksville et devait recevoir son diplôme en 1967. À cette période, il était régulièrement engagé comme musicien professionnel pour donner des concerts et son quota d'heures de sommeil était de fait très réduit. Il arrivait souvent en retard et finalement, lors du décompte des absences, il s'avéra qu'il lui manquait un cours de gymnastique pour pouvoir prétendre à son diplôme. Pour obtenir son papier, il doit fréquenter les cours pendant l'été. Il décide de ne pas s'astreindre à cette obligation et lors d'une interview à un journaliste, il lui dit : « Je ne vais pas à l'université Columbia, je vais à Columbia records ».\n\nIl quitte les bancs d'école pour suivre sa carrière musicale. En 1992, on lui retire l'obligation de suivre des cours de gymnastique. 25 ans après avoir quitté l'université, il obtient son diplôme lors d'une cérémonie à Hicksville.\n\nIl rejoint le groupe The Echoes à l'âge de quatorze ans. Dans les années 1960, il joue en concert avec un groupe de Long Island, les Hassles connaissant un bon succès localement (Every Step I Take, You Got Me Hummin'). Ensuite, il forme le groupe Attila avec le batteur des Hassles, Jon Small. Attila enregistre un seul album. Il existe un LP sorti en 1970 (Epic E 30030) comportant 8 titres :\n    Face A : 1) Wonder woman 2) California flash 3) Revenge is sweet 4) Amplifier fire : Part 1 Godzilla, Part 2 March of the huns ;\n    Face B : 1) Rollin' home 2) Tear this castle down 3) Holy moses 4) Brain invasion.\n\nTous les titres sont composés par William Joel & Jonathan Small. Il obtiendra un bon succès mais le groupe se disloquera peu après. Joel tombe alors en dépression. Souhaitant en finir avec la vie, il est admis au Meadowbrook Hospital après avoir ingéré un produit de polissage pour meubles. Cet épisode malheureux de sa vie est raconté dans sa chanson Tomorrow is Today.\n\nBilly Joel signe sa première chanson avec Artie Ripp et enregistre son premier album solo avec \"Family Productions\". Cold Spring Harbor (en référence à une ville de Long Island du même nom) est enregistré en 1971. L'album sera enregistré à la mauvaise vitesse et l'album vendu avec ce défaut.\n\nLe contrat qui lie Billy Joel avec la \"Family Productions\" ne lui apporte que très peu d'argent provenant de la vente des disques. Joel part pour Los Angeles en Californie avec Elizabeth Weber et joue sous le nom de Bill Martin. En mai 1971, Billy Joel se marie avec Elizabeth. De cette union naîtront des hits tels que She's Got a Way ou encore Everybody Loves You Now enregistré dans l'album Executive Lounge sans avoir réellement de succès. En 1981, lors d'un enregistrement en Live, ces deux hits rejoignent l'album Song in the Attic.\n\nCold Spring Harbor sera réenregistré en 1983 et aura un énorme succès.\n\nSon expérience à Los Angeles le rapproche de Columbia Records, qui obtiendra d'Artie Ripp l'annulation du contrat à la condition que le logo de \"Family Productions\" apparaisse à côté du logo de la Columbia sur les cinq prochains albums, en plus d'une large compensation financière.\n\nSon bref passage à Los Angeles lui inspire la chanson Piano Man et l'album du même nom sera enregistré à la fin 1973. Il s'en vendra plus de 5 millions d'exemplaires. L'annulation du contrat avec Artie Ripp lui coûtera beaucoup d'argent et les ventes de ce disque d'or ne lui rapporteront que 7 000 dollars.\n\nBilly Joel reste à Los Angeles pour écrire Streetlife Serenade, son deuxième album sous le label Columbia. On retrouve des références à la ville et sa banlieue dans l'album. Le titre phare de cet album est The entertainer qui reprend les thèmes de Piano Man. Billy Joel était dérangé par les réarrangements significatifs effectués sur Piano Man pour qu'il passe mieux à la radio, et dans The Entertainer, il crache dans sa soupe avec des paroles sarcastiques comme \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05\" (« Si tu fais un tube, tu devras le couper, pour qu'ils le fassent tenir en 3:05 »).\n\nEn 1976, Billy Joel sort Turnstiles, un titre approprié pour cet album sur les transitions géographiques et professionnelles (turnstiles veut dire tourniquet en anglais). Écrit pour marquer le retour de Billy Joel sur la côte Est après avoir passé trois ans en Californie, le premier titre Say Goodbye to Hollywood montre que Billy Joel prend un nouveau départ. Malgré I've Loved These Days, chanson parlant avec regret d'un Los Angeles du début des années 1970, Turnstiles rend clair le retour de Billy Joel au bercail. En effet, New York State of Mind, une chanson d'amour sur la ville natale de Billy Joel est devenue un classique.\n\nDans Turnstiles, Billy Joel utilise ses propres musiciens dans le studio pour la première fois, et il a plus de contrôle, produisant lui-même son album. Ces prises de risques ont payé, l'album donne beaucoup plus l'impression d'un live que les albums précédents. Néanmoins, la signature de Billy Joel empreinte de cynisme continue de s'exprimer à travers de morceaux tels que Angry Young Man, une chanson qui deviendra un pilier de ses concerts durant des années, en partie grâce à son prélude au piano qui l'introduit.\n\nLa décennie 70 et la seconde moitié de la suivante ont coïncidé avec sa période d'apogée. New York State Of Mind, The Stranger, Just The Way You Are, Honesty, My Life et Uptown Girl sont sans aucun doute ses tubes les plus mémorables.\n\nPour l'album The Stranger, Billy Joel s'associa au producteur Phil Ramone. Quatre titres de ce disque apparurent dans le Top 40 aux États-Unis, les ventes dépassant celles de l'album de Simon et Garfunkel Bridge Over Troubled Water, le titre le mieux vendu auparavant par Columbia Records. Ce fut le premier album de Billy Joel à entrer dans le Top 10, montant jusqu'à la deuxième place des albums les plus vendus à l'époque. Phil Ramone fut reconduit pour produire tous les albums studio de Billy Joel jusqu'à Storm Front sorti en 1989.\n\nThe Stranger permit à Joel de remporter deux Grammy Awards : l'un pour meilleur album, l'autre pour meilleure chanson pour Just the Way You Are, une chanson écrite pour sa femme Elizabeth. Sa chanson \"Vienna\" peut être entendue dans le film 30 ans sinon rien avec Jennifer Garner et Mark Ruffalo...\n\nBilly Joel était attendu au tournant pour son prochain album. 52nd Street représentait une journée passée à Manhattan, et tirait son nom de la rue dans laquelle étaient les bureaux de Columbia Records'. Plus de sept millions d'exemplaires furent vendus, notamment grâce aux succès des titres My Life, Big Shot et Honesty. 52nd Street fut ainsi classé no 1, une première pour Billy Joel. My Life fut choisi comme générique de la sitcom, Bosom Buddies, dans laquelle on peut entre autres retrouver Tom Hanks dans l'un de ses premiers rôles. 52nd Street fut le premier album à sortir en disque compact au Japon en 1982. 52nd Street fut récompensé par 3 Grammy Awards : meilleure performance vocale pop, meilleur artiste masculin et meilleur album.\n\nAprès de nombreuses critiques sur des chansons comme Just The Way You Are,She's Always A Woman ou Honesty, Billy Joel est jugé par de nombreuses critiques comme un « petit rocker ». Trouvant cela injuste et insultant, il décide alors d'enregistrer un album, Glass Houses, afin de prouver qu'il pouvait faire un album plus « rock ».\n\nGlass House est le premier album de Billy Joel à être no 1 dans le Billboard chart. Il y reste pendant six semaines grâce à des titres comme You May Be Right (7e, mai 1980), Don't Ask My Why (19e, septembre 1980), Sometimes A Fantasy (36e, novembre 1980), et surtout It's Still Rock And Roll To Me, qui sera le premier titre de Billy Joel à être no 1 au Billboard chart pendant deux semaines.\n\nIl remporta le Grammy Award de meilleure performance vocale rock, ainsi que le American Music Award de meilleur album pop/rock.\n\nSon album suivant, Songs In The Attic, fut produit à partir de morceaux peu connus de son début de carrière joués en concert. Il fut enregistré pendant une tournée dans des salles et des clubs en juin et juillet 1980.\n\nShe's Got A Way (de l'album Cold Spring Harbor) et Say Goodbye To Hollywood (de l'album Turnstile) seront les seules singles de l'album et auront la 23e et 17e places respectivement dans le Billboard Chart.\n\nThe Nylon Curtain est souvent considéré comme l'album le plus ambitieux de Billy Joel. Il commença à y travailler au printemps 1982 lorsqu'il eut un accident de voiture. Un chauffard ayant grillé un feu rouge percuta Billy Joel alors que celui-ci était à moto. Son poignet gauche fut cassé et sa main sérieusement blessée. À cause des opérations et de la convalescence d'un mois nécessaire, la production de l'album fut interrompue le temps que Billy Joel guérisse.\n\nLe 30 décembre 1982, Billy Joel enregistra son premier concert sur vidéo : Live on Long Island, enregistré au Nassau Coliseum à Uniondale (New York).\n\nLe 20 juillet 1983, Billy Joel et sa femme Elizabeth Weber divorcèrent : Elizabeth obtint alors la moitié de la fortune du chanteur. Pendant ce temps, The Nylon Curtain arriva 7e des meilleures ventes, notamment grâce aux chansons Allentown, Goodnight Saigon et Pressure.\n\nAllentown arriva 17e du Top 100 de l'époque, devenant ainsi l'une des chansons les plus jouées à la radio en 1982.\n\nAprès la fin de sa tournée ayant suivi la sortie de l'album, Joel se retira sur l'île de Saint-Barthélemy pour se reposer. C'est au bar de l'hôtel qu'il rencontra la mannequin Christie Brinkley, qui venait de divorcer. Ils se rapprochèrent, puis finirent par se marier le 23 mars 1985.\n\nLa chanson Uptown Girl fut l'une des premières chansons écrites au retour des vacances de Joel. Uptown Girl a été conçue comme une interrogation à haute voix de Joel sur les raisons qui poussaient la magnifique Christie Brinkley à rester avec un homme comme lui. Cette chanson est devenue un succès mondial dès sa sortie, et fut le seul titre de Joel à avoir été no 1 au Royaume-Uni. L'album résultant, An innocent man, réalisé comme un hommage à la musique \"doo-wop\" des années 1950, fut classé 4e des meilleures ventes au États-Unis et 2e en Angleterre, grâce notamment à la présence de six de ses chansons dans le Top 30 des charts américains qui sont Leave A Tender Moment Alone (27e), Keeping The Faith (18e), The Longest Times (14e), An Innocent Man (10e), Uptown Girl (3e) et, Tell Her About It (1er).\n\nL'album fut également nommé pour le Grammy du meilleur album de l'année, mais il perdit face à Thriller de Michael Jackson.\n\nAprès le succès de An Innocent Man, Joel avait été consulté pour produire un album de ses meilleurs titres. Ce n'était pas la première fois que ce sujet était abordé, mais Joel avait au commencement considéré la réalisation de compilations de ses meilleurs titres comme sonnant la fin de sa carrière. Cette fois, il accepta, et Greatest Hits Vol. 1 et 2 sorti dans un format deux disques deux faces ou 2 CD, avec les chansons dans leur ordre de création. Les nouvelles chansons \"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\" et \"The Night Is Still Young\" ont été enregistrées et diffusées pour soutenir l'album.\n\nGreatest Hits remporta un franc succès, se vendant à plus de vingt millions d'exemplaires dans le monde devenant le double album le plus vendu de tous les temps par un artiste solo, seul The Wall des Pink Floyd ayant fait mieux et le Double Blanc des Beatles. Jusqu'ici c'est le 6e album le plus vendu dans l'histoire américaine de musique selon la RIAA.\n\nCoïncidant avec la sortie de Greatest Hits, Joel sorti une compilation des vidéos promotionnels qu'il avait enregistrées de 1977 à 1985. En plus de vidéos pour accompagner certains morceaux des Greatest Hits, Joel enregistra également un clip de son premier succès : \"Piano Man\".\n\nDeux version de Greatest Hits sortirent en CD : l'une en 1985 et l'autre en 1998. Bien qu'ayant toutes les deux la même trame générale, on peut néanmoins noter quelques légères différences :\n\n    Bien que tous les titres les plus longs soient intacts (comme \"Piano Man\", \"Captain Jack\" ou \"Goodnight Saigon\"), d'autres chansons plus courtes (\"Pressure\", \"Just The Way You Are\" ou encore \"My Life\") ont été raccourcies de manière significative dans la version de 1985. Pourtant, le livret accompagnant l'album liste l'ensemble des paroles, même celles tronquées. Ces chansons sont en version intégrale dans la version de 1998.\n    Dans l'album de 1985, c'est la version live de \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" sur Songs in the Attic qui est utilisée alors que c'est la version de l'album Turnstiles qu'on peut entendre sur la compilation de 1998.\n    La version de 1998 a une qualité de son améliorée, grâce aux progrès technologiques faits depuis la première sortie.\n\nJoel venait de remporter un vif succès avec \"Modern Woman\" de la bande originale du film Y a-t-il quelqu'un pour tuer ma femme ? (Ruthless People) (avec Bette Midler, Danny DeVito et Judge Reinhold) quand il commença à travailler sur l'album The Bridge au début de 1986. Ray Charles apporta sa contribution à la chanson \"Baby Grand\", et Steve Winwood joua de l'orgue sur \"Getting Closer\". Cyndi Lauper a aussi contribué à cet album en faisant partie des chœurs.\n\nBien que faisant partie des 10 albums les plus vendus du moment, The Bridge n'eut pas autant de succès que certains autres albums de Joel. Quelques chansons sortirent néanmoins du lot : la ballade \"This Is The Time\" est un classique des bals de fin d'année, \"Modern Woman\", pourtant considérée par Joel lui-même comme ne méritant pas d'attention, rencontra un vif succès dans sa forme single.\n\nC'est à cette époque que Billy participa au dessin animé de Disney Oliver et Compagnie, sorti en 1988, dans lequel il double le chien Dodger (Roublard en français). Il enregistra également une chanson spécialement pour le film : \"Why Should I Worry?\". Billy expliqua avoir accepté ce rôle par amour pour les films de lorsqu'il était enfant.\n\nPendant la tournée suivant la sortie de The Bridge, Joel et ses musiciens commencèrent à prévoir une tournée dans l'Union soviétique à l'été 1987, une première pour un artiste rock américain depuis la construction du mur de Berlin. Et donc, en juin 1987, six concerts eurent lieu, trois à Moscou et trois à Leningrad, tous filmés et radiodiffusés.\n\nL'album КОНЦЕРТ, \"concert\" en russe, sorti à l'automne 1987. Joel aurait perdu environ 1 million de dollars pour la tournée, mais il déclara ne pas regretter ce déficit au vu de l'hospitalité dont les Russes avaient fait preuve.\n\nLa chanson \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", le premier single de l'album Storm Front, sorti en septembre 1989, et devint rapidement la 3e chanson de Joel numéro 1 aux États-Unis.\n\nStorm Front sorti en octobre 1989, et devint finalement le premier album de Joel à être numéro 1 aux États-Unis depuis Glass Houses, neuf années auparavant. Storm Front fut le premier album depuis Turnstiles à ne pas avoir été enregistré avec Phil Ramone en producteur. Pour cet album, il voulait un nouveau son, et s'entoura donc de Mick Jones du groupe Foreigner et de la musicienne Crystal Taliefero (qui devint finalement sa directrice musicale). Hormis \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", l'album comportait aussi la chanson \"Leningrad\", écrite après une rencontre avec un clown dans la ville soviétique lors de la tournée en URSS.\n\nEn 1992, Joel poursuivit son ancien manager et ex-beau-frère Frank Weber (frère de son ex-femme Elizabeth) pour diverses fraudes de comptabilité. L'affaire fut réglée à l'amiable.\n\nJoel commença à travailler sur River Of Dreams au début de 1993. La couverture de l'album était une peinture de Christie Brinkley représentant chacune des chansons du disque. La chanson éponyme River Of Dreams (In the Middle Of the Night) eut un énorme succès international et fut la dernière de Joel à entrer dans le top 10.\n\nEn août 1995, le bassiste de Billy Joel, Doug Stegmeyer se suicide dans sa maison de Long Island. Stegmeyer avait participé à tous les albums de Joel de Turnstiles à The Bridge.\n\nEn 1999, Joel se produit au Madison Square Garden (New York) à la veille du nouveau millénaire. Le concert dure près de quatre heures et est ensuite commercialisé sous le titre 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert.\n\nEn 2001 sort l'album Fantasies & Delusions, une compilation de morceaux de piano, tous composés par Billy Joel et interprétés par Richard Joo. Joel utilise d'ailleurs souvent des extraits de ces morceaux comme interludes entre ses chansons en concert. L'album est le plus vendu des albums classiques du moment.\n\nJoel effectue de nombreux concerts avec Elton John dans une tournée intitulée \"Face to Face\", durant laquelle les deux chanteurs interprétent, seuls ou en duo, des chansons des deux hommes.\n\nEn 2005, Columbia sort un coffret, My Lives, qui est dans une large mesure une compilation d'inédits, de face-B et de versions live de tubes de Joel. On y trouve le logiciel Umixit, grâce auquel il est possible de remixer avec son PC \"Zanzibar\", \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Keepin' The Faith\", et des versions live de \"I Go To Extremes\" et \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\". Un DVD de la tournée River of Dreams est également inclus.\n\nLe 7 janvier 2006, Joel débute une nouvelle tournée à travers les États-Unis. N'ayant pas écrit de nouvelles chansons, ses concerts reposent sur de nouvelles versions de toutes ses chansons, y compris les tubes. Douze concerts à guichets fermés ont lieu au Madison Square Garden (un record, le précédent tenant du titre étant Bruce Springsteen avec onze concerts), concerts desquels sont extraites les chansons de l'album \"12 Gardens: Live\", sorti en juin 2006. Joel s'arrête aussi au Royaume-Uni et en Irlande pour la première fois depuis de nombreuses années.\n\nLe 4 février 2007 à Miami, Joel devint le premier chanteur à avoir interprété deux fois l'hymne national américain avant la finale du Super Bowl, il avait déjà participé à cet événement en 1989 (à Miami également).\n\nLe 11 mars 2011 sort un double album live intitulé \"Live at the Shea Stadium\".\n\nCe concert est le dernier donné au mythique Shea Stadium de New York en juillet 2008 un mois avant sa démolition.",
