      "biography": "The Stone Roses were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. They were one of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani, and drummer Reni.\n\nThe Stone Roses released their eponymous debut album in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band, receiving widespread critical acclaim, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded.\n\nFollowing this success, the band sought to capitalize on their newfound fame by signing with a major label. However, their record label at the time, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, leading to a lengthy legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991.\n\nThe Stone Roses released their second album, Second Coming, in 1994, which received mixed reviews. The group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at the Reading Festival.\n\nFollowing much media speculation, the Stone Roses announced their reunion on 18 October 2011 and embarked on a world tour in 2012, including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester. Plans to record a third album were also floated, but only two singles were released. In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of the film Spike Island, revealed that the band \"have at least three or four new tracks recorded\". In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation, directed by Shane Meadows and titled The Stone Roses: Made of Stone, was released.\n\nIn 2016, the Stone Roses released two new songs, which were their first new material in two decades. The band continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated that the band had split again. This was later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Roses\n\nStudio albums\nThe Stone Roses (1989)\nSecond Coming (1994) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at Forge Studios in Oswestry, Shropshire and Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales between 1992 and 1994. On cassette tape and vinyl record it was a double album.\n\nThe second album by the influential Manchester four-piece, it suffered greatly at the time from the sheer weight of expectation generated by both the 5½ year gap between it and the band's eponymous debut, and the band's withdrawal from the live arena for 4½ of those years. In addition, The Stone Roses made their return in a changed musical environment, with the UK newly-ensconced in Britpop with Blur and Oasis as the premier rock bands of the day. The album reached number 4 in the UK Album Chart.\n\nSecond Coming features tribal rhythms, 1970s-style extended guitar riffs, funky rock/blues numbers with jazz elements and campfire style songs such as \"Your Star Will Shine\" and \"Tightrope\" that hint at the bands rural surroundings at the time (the band moved to Wales to make the album). As the line-up began to crumble, three singles (\"Love Spreads\", \"Ten Storey Love Song\", and \"Begging You\") from the album were released in the UK.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/Second+Coming\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
