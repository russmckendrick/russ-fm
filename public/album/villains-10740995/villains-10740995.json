      "biography": "Queens of the Stone Age are a rock band from Palm Desert, California, United States. The band is frequently labeled stoner rock, although they reject the label. They developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy music which the band's founder and mastermind Josh Homme described as \"robot rock\", saying that he \"wanted to create a heavy sound based on a solid jam, just pound it into your head\". Since then, their sound has evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences.\n\nWhile in high school, Homme got together with locals Brant Bjork, Chris Cockrell (later replaced by Nick Oliveri) and John Garcia resulting in the formation of Kyuss (firstly known as \"Sons of Kyuss\"). Queens of the Stone Age formed in 1997, rising from the ashes of Kyuss and began playing together during the now legendary Desert Sessions. Homme has drawn all of the members from that diverse group of musicians for Queens of the Stone Age. The band originally formed under the name Gamma Ray, but almost faced a lawsuit from the European metal band of the same name.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age have gone through many line-up changes since first breaking into the hard rock scene. Their most recent line-up includes: Josh Homme (guitar, vocals), Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboards, backing vocals), Jon Theodore (drums, percussion), Michael Shuman (bass, backing vocals), and Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals).\n\nFormer core members include Joey Castillo, Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Mark Lanegan, and Nick Oliveri, among other members and contributors. In 2002, regarding the band line-up, Homme said: \"It really is more of a musical experiment… It keeps moving and reinventing itself. That way we never get painted into a corner.\"\n\nDave Grohl recorded drums, percussion and backing vocals on Songs for the Deaf and toured in support of the album in 2002 before returning to the Foo Fighters. Grohl also made a live appearance in 2007, to play Make It wit Chu, and recorded tracks on …Like Clockwork, following Joey Castillo's departure.\n\nMark Lanegan has long been an on/off vocalist for the band, toured from 2001 to 2005 and made live appearances in 2007 and 2010. He has recorded with the band on all albums except for their self-titled debut album. Lanegan has also played keyboards in live performances during the tour preceding the release of Lullabies to Paralyze, before Natasha Shneider joined the band.\n\nJosh Homme and Nick Oliveri  were seen as the only two consistent Queens of the Stone Age members. Oliveri had previously played alongside Homme in the band Kyuss and joined Queens of the Stone Age as its permanent bass guitarist and co-lead vocalist, in 1998, upon the release of its debut album, Queens of the Stone Age. Being friends since childhood, the two meshed well together. Oliveri's punk background brought an element of danger and attitude to the Queens' live shows.  As the band's two core members, the duo recorded the breakthrough albums, Rated R and Songs for the Deaf, together. Oliveri's unique \"howling\" singing style made him easily distinguishable on songs such as Six Shooter from the album Songs for the Deaf; he also displays a more melodic singing style in Rated R songs such as Auto Pilot.\n\nHowever, Homme fired Oliveri in 2004 for excessive partying and an alleged incident of domestic abuse (an accusation which Oliveri strongly denies). The duo repaired their friendship shortly afterwards. Oliveri, however, did not return to the band. In 2013, upon hearing that former contributor Dave Grohl was recording drums for the band's sixth studio album, …Like Clockwork, Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Homme ultimately did not grant Oliveri's request. He does, however, appear on backing vocals on the album track, If I Had a Tail.\n\nDiskographie:\n\n1997 - Kyuss / Queens of the Stone Age\n1998 - Queens of the Stone Age / Beaver Split\n1998 - Queens of the Stone Age\n2000 - Rated R\n2002 - Songs for the Deaf\n2002 - Sample This School Boy\n2002 - 2002-10-29: Rock City, Nottingham, UK\n2002 - 2002-11-06: Stockholm, Sweden\n2003 - Songs For The Deaf Tour Edition \n2004 - Stone Age Complication\n2005 - Lullabies to Paralyze\n2005 - Lullabies To Paralize Tour Edition\n2005 - MTV Unplugged (Berlin 2005-06-10)\n2005 - Over the Years and Through the Woods\n2006 - 2005-12-20: Los Angeles, CA, USA\n2006 - Over The Years And Through The Woods\n2007 - The Definitive Collection Of B-sides & Rarities\n2007 - Era Vulgaris\n2008 - Era Vulgaris Tour Edition\n2013 - ...Like Clockwork\n2017 - Villains\n2023 - In Times New Roman... <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Villains is the seventh studio album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age, released on August 25, 2017 through Matador. The album was announced on June 14, with a teaser trailer taking the form of a comedy skit featuring the band performing a polygraph test with Liam Lynch. The first single, \"The Way You Used to Do\", was released the following day along with the announcement of a world tour. Villains is the first Queens of the Stone Age album to not feature any special guest musicians, the second to not feature Mark Lanegan, and the first to feature Jon Theodore as full time member of the band.\n\nSeveral of the songs from the album were previewed in some form prior to its release. The album's final track, \"Villains of Circumstance\", was first premiered by Josh Homme in 2014 at an acoustic concert for James Lavelle's Meltdown Festival, while \"The Evil Has Landed\" was performed by the band during their first gig of 2017 on June 22 at The Rapids Theatre in Niagara Falls, New York. \"The Evil Has Landed\" was released as a single on August 10, 2017. In addition to this, several snippets of songs have been featured in teaser trailers released online in promotion of the album, including a short clip of the album's opening track, \"Feet Don't Fail Me\", as well as an a cappella from the intro to the same song.\n\nThe album has been described as \"a little looser and more uptempo than their last release ...Like Clockwork and \"more carefree\". Josh Homme cited his interest in dancing, working with Mark Ronson, and the song, \"Uptown Funk\" for the direction of the album. Kory Grow of Rolling Stone notes, \"While the guitars still have the limber crunch of Queens albums past, they're playing around easy-breezy disco beats and chilly synths on songs like \"Feet Don't Fail Me\" and \"Un-Reborn Again.\"\"\n\nThe cover art for Villains was designed by graphic artist Boneface, who designed the artwork for Queens of the Stone Age's previous album, ...Like Clockwork. It was the first time that the band had returned to an artist to request artwork on a subsequent album. In an interview with the Juxtapoz magazine, Boneface talked about returning to create a cover for the album and his working relationship with Josh Homme. In the article he stated that, \"Returning was honestly a pretty daunting task. People seemed to like all the artwork I did for the last album, so I felt I had something to live up to. Also, the fact that QOTSA tend to use a different artist for each album cover made it kind of special that they decided to use me again. I think Josh likened our relationship to Hunter S. Thompson and Ralph Steadman in the initial rallying call. So after I’d decided to plunge back into the QOTSA jacuzzi, I started work the way I usually do, just trying to create something cool. I did a bunch of preliminary drawings before I’d heard any new songs or we’d even talk about the album, and one of those sketches actually ended up being the basis for the album cover.\" Each band member was given their own artwork, with Homme's on the front cover, and the rest of the band members on the back. An alternate vinyl cover that was released exclusively through independent record stores had a light blue tint over the image, gave Josh Homme a bloody nose, and the devil behind Homme giving two middle fingers. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age/Villains\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
