      "biography": "Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. (April 2, 1939 - April 1, 1984), better known by his stage name Marvin Gaye (he added the 'e' as a young man), was an acclaimed American singer-songwriter and musician who achieved major success in the 1960s and 1970s as an artist for the Motown label.\nBorn and raised in Washington, D.C., Gaye was the son of a storefront minister of a local Pentecostal church and grew up singing in his father's church, later learning to play piano and drums. As a teenager, he discovered doo-wop and joined local doo-wop groups in the D.C. area. After dropping out of school and briefly enlisting in the United States Air Force, he returned to D.C. where he formed the Marquees, who were first discovered by Bo Diddley and later was mentored by Harvey Fuqua, who changed their name to \"Harvey & The New Moonglows\", recording for Chess Records for two years. Later leaving the Moonglows for a solo career as Harvey Fuqua's protege, he settled for work in Detroit labels such as Anna and Tri-Phi Records before joining Motown in 1961.\nInitially earning pay as a session drummer and encompassing a three-octave vocal range, Gaye eventually became Motown's top-selling solo artist of the 1960s. He was crowned \"The Prince of Motown\" and \"The Prince of Soul\" because of solo hits such as \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\", \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and his duet singles with singers such as Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell.\nHis early 1970s releases, What's Going On and Let's Get It On paved the way for the concept album format in R&B music in the 1970s while the Let's Get It On and I Want You albums helped influence the quiet storm, urban contemporary and slow jam genres. After a self-imposed tax exile in Europe in the early 1980s, Gaye returned on the 1982 Grammy-Award winning hit, \"Sexual Healing\" and the Midnight Love album. After a violent argument with his father, he was shot dead by him on April 1, 1984.\nIn 2008, the American music magazine Rolling Stone ranked Gaye at number 6 on its list of the Greatest Singers of All Time, and ranked at number 18 on 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and he ranked number 20 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Gaye was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.",

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> When Marvin Gaye brought the title track of 1971’s <i>What’s Going On</i> to Motown founder Berry Gordy, Gordy reportedly said it was the worst thing he’d ever heard. The music was too loose, the lyrics too political. Too political? Gaye countered. This is the 1970s: You’ve got the Vietnam War; you’ve got growing poverty and systemic racism; you’ve got an environment under threat. Even Elvis was singing protest songs (1969’s “In the Ghetto”)—why couldn’t Marvin Gaye?<br />\nThe album’s genius is in its lightness. Songs drift and breathe; performances feel natural, even offhand—Eli Fontaine's saxophone part on the title track, for example, was recorded when Fontaine thought he was just warming up. As Sly & The Family Stone channelled their anger into into bitter funk (1971’s <i>There’s a Riot Goin’ On</i>), Gaye sublimated his in lush string sections and Latin percussion—signals not just of musical gentleness, but cultural sophistication. Even in the face of bleakness (the addiction portrait of “Flyin’ High [In the Friendly Sky],” “Inner City Blues [Make Me Wanna Holler]”), he floats.<br />\nThe revelation is that political music doesn’t have to be confrontational—it can be mellow and inviting too, the province not just of radicals, but the same mixed, middle-class audiences that had been buying Gaye’s albums all along. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, and as Gaye seems to say on <i>What’s Going On</i>, you don’t have to be a hippie to be worried by what you see—you just have to be human.",

          "standard": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> When Marvin Gaye brought the title track of 1971’s <i>What’s Going On</i> to Motown founder Berry Gordy, Gordy reportedly said it was the worst thing he’d ever heard. The music was too loose, the lyrics too political. Too political? Gaye countered. This is the 1970s: You’ve got the Vietnam War; you’ve got growing poverty and systemic racism; you’ve got an environment under threat. Even Elvis was singing protest songs (1969’s “In the Ghetto”)—why couldn’t Marvin Gaye?<br />\nThe album’s genius is in its lightness. Songs drift and breathe; performances feel natural, even offhand—Eli Fontaine's saxophone part on the title track, for example, was recorded when Fontaine thought he was just warming up. As Sly & The Family Stone channelled their anger into into bitter funk (1971’s <i>There’s a Riot Goin’ On</i>), Gaye sublimated his in lush string sections and Latin percussion—signals not just of musical gentleness, but cultural sophistication. Even in the face of bleakness (the addiction portrait of “Flyin’ High [In the Friendly Sky],” “Inner City Blues [Make Me Wanna Holler]”), he floats.<br />\nThe revelation is that political music doesn’t have to be confrontational—it can be mellow and inviting too, the province not just of radicals, but the same mixed, middle-class audiences that had been buying Gaye’s albums all along.

            "content": "What's Going On is the eleventh studio album by the American soul singer Marvin Gaye. It was released on May 21, 1971, by the Motown Records subsidiary label Tamla. Recorded between 1970 and 1971 in sessions at Hitsville U.S.A., Golden World, United Sound Studios in Detroit, and at The Sound Factory in West Hollywood, California, it was Gaye's first album to credit him as producer and to credit Motown's in-house session musicians, known as the Funk Brothers.\n\nWhat's Going On is a concept album with most of its songs segueing into the next and has been categorized as a song cycle. The narrative established by the songs is told from the point of view of a Vietnam veteran returning to his home country to witness hatred, suffering, and injustice. Gaye's introspective lyrics explore themes of drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. He has also been credited with promoting awareness of ecological issues before the public outcry over them had become prominent (\"Mercy Mercy Me\").\n\nWhat's Going On stayed on the Billboard Top LPs for over a year and became Gaye's second number-one album on Billboard's Soul LPs chart, where it stayed for nine weeks, and on the No. 2 spot for another 12 weeks, respectively. The title track, which had been released in January 1971 as the album's lead single, hit number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and held the top position on Billboard's Soul Singles chart five weeks running. The follow-up singles \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" and \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\" also reached the top 10 of the Hot 100, making Gaye the first male solo artist to place three top ten singles on the Hot 100 from one album.\n\nThe first Marvin Gaye album credited as produced solely by the artist himself, What's Going On is a unified concept album consisting of nine songs, most of which lead into the next. It has also been categorized as a song cycle; the album ends on a reprise of the album's opening theme. The album is told from the point of view of a Vietnam War veteran returning to the country he had been fighting for, and seeing nothing but injustice, suffering and hatred.\n \n\"What's Going On\" was the first album on which Motown Records' main studio band, the group of session musicians known as the Funk Brothers, received an official credit. The album features introspective lyrics and socially-conscious themes about drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. \"What's Going On\" was both an immediate commercial and critical success and has endured as a classic of early-1970s soul. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marvin+Gaye/What%27s+Going+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
