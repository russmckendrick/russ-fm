      "biography": "Pulp is a British band formed in Sheffield in 1978, fronted by lead singer and songwriter Jarvis Cocker. The group is known for their sharp, observational lyrics and a blend of pop, rock, and disco elements. They rose to fame in the mid-1990s as part of the Britpop movement, achieving significant success with their fifth album, His 'n' Hers (1994). However, it was their 1995 album, Different Class, that cemented their place in music history, featuring iconic tracks like \"Common People\" and \"Disco 2000.\" These songs offered witty and incisive commentaries on British life and class issues, resonating with a wide audience.\n\nFollowing Different Class, Pulp continued to explore darker and more introspective themes with albums like This Is Hardcore (1998) and We Love Life (2001). These later works demonstrated the band's versatility and depth, exploring complex emotional landscapes and societal critiques. Jarvis Cocker's charismatic presence and lyrical storytelling have been central to Pulp's enduring appeal, making them one of the most influential bands of their era. Their music continues to be celebrated for its intelligence, humor, and cultural relevance.",

            "content": "We Love Life is the seventh studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 22 October 2001 by Island Records. It reached number six on the UK Albums Chart, with a total chart stay of only three weeks. Written and recorded after the tumultuous sessions for This Is Hardcore, We Love Life saw the band move toward a more relaxed and natural sound, shepherded by producer Scott Walker. Walker had replaced original producer Chris Thomas, whom the band had worked with on previous albums.\n\nWe Love Life saw positive critical reception and charted at number 6 on the UK album charts.\n\nWe Love Life was intended to be a departure from the disillusionment of the band's previous album, This Is Hardcore, in that it featured a more organic sound and an emphasis on nature, which Cocker found interest in \"because it is dangerous in some ways\". Cocker explained, \"I never took any notice of nature when I was a kid. I thought we'd all be living on space stations or floating metropolises by now. But after This Is Hardcore, which was a very alienated record, it was time to go back to simpler things, like this, the natural world.\" At the same time, Cocker stated, \"This isn't Pulp's pastoral album. I was very aware of avoiding hippy dippy stuff.\"\n\nThe band had initially begun recording with Chris Thomas, who had produced their past two albums. However, his more rigid style of recording conflicted with the band's desire for looser sessions, resulting in the recordings being shelved. The final album was produced by Scott Walker. Keyboardist Candida Doyle recalled, \"I certainly thought about leaving  but I realised that I'd still feel shit even if I did. If Scott Walker hadn't come about, I don't think we'd have bothered to finish this LP.\" The band, who had met Walker at the 2000 Meltdown Festival run by Walker, had been longtime fans of Walker.\n\nWalker's own album 'Til the Band Comes In is mocked in the lyrics of the We Love Life single \"Bad Cover Version\". Cocker claims the lyric was written long before Walker became involved in the album's production and recalled the moment of recording the song as \"embarrassing\".\n\nThe album's title was originally to be Pulp Love Life, but this was vetoed as Cocker felt that the title looked confusing on an album cover—he explained, \"It always looked like the name of the band's Pulp and the album's called Love Life.\" The album was then renamed Pulp, reflecting the \"uncluttered\" nature of the album. With the September 11 terrorist attacks, however, the album was renamed to the more universal We Love Life. Cocker recalled, \"To be honest, I was really freaked out when that World Trade Center thing happened. ... So in the aftermath of that, I thought, actually this Love Life business isn't a bad sentiment at this particular time.\"\n\nThe minimal cover art (by Peter Saville) shows a set of initial capitals held in the collection of St. Bride Printing Library in London. They were engraved in wood by or for Louis Pouchée around the 1820s.\n\nInitial critical response to We Love Life was very positive. The album received an average score of 84 at Metacritic, based on 20 reviews. The music review online magazine Pitchfork placed We Love Life at number 194 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.\n\nSteve Hobbs of Q Magazine wrote of the album, \"Cocker's lyrics are still sharp and beautifully observed, just a little less personal. But in many ways, it's a more familiar Pulp record than This Is Hardcore\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album \"an emotional and musical breakthrough, finding the band leaping beyond the claustrophobic Hardcore and consolidating their previous obsessions, creating a textured, reflective record that in its own measured way is as impassioned as Different Class\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pulp/We+Love+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
