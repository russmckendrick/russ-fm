      "biography": "John William Coltrane (also known as \"Trane\"; September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz. He organized at least fifty recording sessions as a leader during his recording career, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.\nAs his career progressed, Coltrane and his music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. His second wife was pianist Alice Coltrane and their son Ravi Coltrane is a saxophonist. Coltrane influenced innumerable musicians, and remains one of the most significant saxophonists in jazz history. He received many posthumous awards and recognitions, including canonization by the African Orthodox Church as Saint John William Coltrane. In 2007, Coltrane was awarded the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for his \"masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz.\"",

      "editorial_notes": "Beginning with a phrase that’s among the most famous in modern jazz, <i>Blue Train</i>, which John Coltrane called his favourite recording of his own music, is an unqualified hard bop masterpiece. Recorded in September 1957, this is Coltrane’s first major album as a bandleader (and his only one as a leader for Blue Note), and he selected some of the best young jazzmen of the era to join him: fellow Miles Davis band alumni Paul Chambers (bass) and Philly Joe Jones (drums) along with Lee Morgan (trumpet), Curtis Fuller (trombone) and Kenny Drew (piano). Featuring four Coltrane compositions plus the Johnny Mercer ballad “I’m Old Fashioned”, the music is thrilling, passionate and melodic from start to finish. There’s exceptional playing by both Morgan and Fuller: Marvel at how Fuller’s nimble solo on “Locomotion” leads into the flurry of notes that begins Morgan’s own solo, one of the highlights of the album. Coltrane’s solos are muscular and focused, and while the notes often come fast and furious, nothing is wasted here. He’s stretching the limits of the blues form without abandoning its basic structure (as he would later). It’s particularly fascinating to hear the roots of the ideas that Coltrane would explore more fully on his 1959 landmark recording <i>Giant Steps</i>. Powerful and searching yet accessible, this timeless album is a must for jazz aficionados and neophytes alike.",

            "content": "Blue Train is a studio album by John Coltrane which was released in January 1958 by Blue Note Records. Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio in Hackensack, New Jersey, it is the only Blue Note recording by Coltrane as session leader. It has been certified a gold record by the RIAA.\n\nBackground\nThe album was recorded in the midst of Coltrane's residency at the Five Spot as a member of the Thelonious Monk quartet. The personnel include Coltrane's Miles Davis bandmates, Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums, both of whom had worked before with pianist Kenny Drew. Both trumpeter Lee Morgan and trombonist Curtis Fuller were up-and-coming jazz musicians, and both were members of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in due course. Unlike his previous label, Blue Note paid the musicians to rehearse the music for a couple of days before the recording session.\n\nAll of the compositions were written by Coltrane, with the exception of the standard \"I'm Old Fashioned\". Though at this point his compositions used conventional diatonic harmonies, they were set in unconventional ways. The title track is a blues with a quasi-minor (Eb7#9) theme. \"Locomotion\" is also a blues riff tune, in forty-four-bar form. \"Lazy Bird\" is in part a transposition into the key of \"G\" of the Tadd Dameron composition \"Lady Bird\".\n\nColtrane's playing exhibits the move toward what would become his signature style. His solos are more harmonic or \"vertical\" and lines arpeggiated. His timing was often apart from or over the beat, rather than playing on or behind it. During a 1960 interview, Coltrane described Blue Train as his favorite album of his own up to that point.\n\nMichael Cuscuna, the reissue producer at Blue Note had this to say from Joe Vella's podcast \"Traneumentary\": \"We’re listening to Blue Train, which to me is one of the most beautiful pieces on one of the most beautiful records that Coltrane recorded in the fifties. It’s his first real mature statement and he wrote all but one of the tunes on this album which was very rare in the fifties and each one is a gem, particularly the title tune Blue Train. And while it’s kind of easy to play the blues, this has a suspended and haunting kind of quality to it.\"\n\nLegacy\nJohn Coltrane's next major album, Giant Steps, recorded in 1959, would break new melodic and harmonic ground in jazz, whereas Blue Train adheres to the hard bop style of the era. Musicologist Lewis Porter has also demonstrated a harmonic relationship between Coltrane's \"Lazy Bird\" and Tadd Dameron's \"Lady Bird\".\n\nIn 1997, The Ultimate Blue Train was released, adding two alternate takes and enhanced content, and in 1999 a 24bit 192 kHz DVD-Audio version was issued. In 2003, both a Super Audio Compact Disc version was released, as well as a remastered compact disc as part of Blue Note's Rudy Van Gelder series.\n\nIn 2000 it was voted number 339 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. He stated \"Coltrane may have made more important albums, but none swung as effectively as this one.\"\n\nIn 2015, Blue Note/Universal released a Blu-Ray Audio edition of the album with four bonus tracks, one of which is a previously unreleased take of \"Lazy Bird\".\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane – tenor saxophone\nLee Morgan – trumpet\nCurtis Fuller – trombone\nKenny Drew – piano\nPaul Chambers – bass\nPhilly Joe Jones – drums <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Coltrane/Blue+Train\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
