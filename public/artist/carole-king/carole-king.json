  "biography": "Carole King Klein (born Carol Joan Klein; February 9, 1942) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who has been active since 1958, initially as one of the staff songwriters at 1650 Broadway and later as a solo artist. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential musicians of all time, King is the most successful female songwriter of the latter half of the 20th century in the US, having written or co-written 118 pop hits on the Billboard Hot 100. King also wrote 61 hits that charted in the UK, making her the most successful female songwriter on the UK singles charts between 1962 and 2005.\n\nKing's major success began in the 1960s when she and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, wrote more than two dozen chart hits, many of which have become standards, for numerous artists. She has continued writing for other artists since then. King's success as a performer in her own right did not come until the 1970s, when she sang her own songs, accompanying herself on the piano, in a series of albums and concerts. After experiencing commercial disappointment with her debut album Writer, King scored her breakthrough with the album Tapestry, which topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks in 1971 and remained on the charts for more than six years.\n\nKing has made 25 solo albums, the most successful being Tapestry, which held the record for most weeks at No. 1 by a female artist for more than 20 years. Her record sales were estimated at more than 75 million copies worldwide. She has won four Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. She has been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a performer and songwriter. She is the recipient of the 2013 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the first woman to be so honored. She is also a 2015 Kennedy Center Honoree.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King\n\nStudio albums\nWriter (1970)\nTapestry (1971)\nMusic (1971)\nRhymes & Reasons (1972)\nFantasy (1973)\nWrap Around Joy (1974)\nThoroughbred (1976)\nSimple Things (1977)\nWelcome Home (1978)\nTouch the Sky (1979)\nPearls: Songs of Goffin and King (1980)\nOne to One (1982)\nSpeeding Time (1983)\nCity Streets (1989)\nColour of Your Dreams (1993)\nLove Makes the World (2001)\nA Holiday Carole (2011) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carole+King\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
