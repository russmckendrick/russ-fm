      "biography": "LCD Soundsystem was an American-based dance-punk band from New York City. It was fronted by American singer-songwriter and producer James Murphy, co-founder of record label DFA Records. The group released three critically acclaimed albums, LCD Soundsystem, Sound of Silver and This Is Happening, with the last charting in the Billboard Top 10.\nOn February 5, 2011, a statement was posted on the band's website that announced its disbandment following a farewell concert, which took place on April 2, 2011, at Madison Square Garden. The farewell concert is chronicled in the documentary film Shut Up and Play the Hits. Their last televised performance was on February 14, 2011 on The Colbert Report.\nLCD Soundsystem gained attention with its first single, \"Losing My Edge\". Described as \"an eight-minute, laugh-out-loud funny dissection of cool over a dirty electronic beat\"; the single became an underground dance favorite. This was followed by other well received singles \"Give It Up\" and \"Yeah\".\nLCD Soundsystem released a double disc set simply titled LCD Soundsystem in February 2005 to critical acclaim. The first disc contains the album and the second contains re-releases of previous singles. The opening track \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\" quickly gained popularity and entered the UK Top 40 in March 2005 and was later featured on several video game soundtracks like SSX on Tour, Forza Motorsport 2, Burnout Revenge, and FIFA 06. The band toured with M.I.A.\nIn June 2005, the band covered a Siouxsie and the Banshees song, \"Slowdive\" for the B-side of \"Disco Infiltrator\".\nOn December 8, 2005 the group received nominations for two Grammy awards in the Electronica category for their self-titled album and in the Dance category for \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House.\" This album was also chosen as #94 of Amazon.com's \"Top 100 Editor's Picks\" of 2005.",

      "editorial_notes": "James Murphy has always made things difficult for himself. By building a music career around the meta-narrative of being someone <i>knowingly</i> having a music career, every move he made was subject to scrutiny beyond that of a mere musician. Murphy painted himself into a corner—as did an artist from a previous generation: David Bowie. So it’s almost unbelievable that, before his death in 2016, Bowie told Murphy it was OK for the LCD Soundsystem mastermind to reform the band a mere five years after their much ballyhooed “final show” at Madison Square Garden.\n\nFollowing his mentor’s advice, LCD played their first reunion show not long afterward. But fans would have to wait until 2017 for LCD’s comeback album, <i>american dream</i>. By then, Murphy had lost several musical heroes, including Bowie, Leonard Cohen and Alan Vega of Suicide (a band name-checked on the first LCD song, “Losing My Edge”). When <i>american dream</i> was finally released, Murphy told interviewers that he’d imagined Cohen doing a “spoken word bit” on the song “Black Screen” (ostensibly a tribute to Bowie) mere days before the 82-year-old Cohen’s passing. Clearly, time was slipping away.\n\nAlso slipping away: The 2000s indie-dance scene that had once viewed Murphy as a leading star. Sure, LCD Soundsystem’s beloved back catalogue could sell out concerts until the end of time. But Murphy was no longer a scenester darling—a point he addresses on <i>american dream</i>’s “I Used To”, which finds him singing, “I used to dance alone of my own volition.” The album’s “Emotional Haircut”, meanwhile, finds Murphy ignoring the 2000s altogether: With its intertwined guitar and drum exchange, the song recalls the early-1990s American post-hardcore scene that had chewed up and spit out Murphy early on in his music career. To quote Simone de Beauvoir, a philosopher often linked to none other than Bowie: “If you live long enough, you'll see that every victory turns into a defeat.”",

          "short": "A comeback for LCD—and a comedown from the early-2000s sound.",
          "standard": "James Murphy has always made things difficult for himself. By building a music career around the meta-narrative of being someone <i>knowingly</i> having a music career, every move he made was subject to scrutiny beyond that of a mere musician. Murphy painted himself into a corner—as did an artist from a previous generation: David Bowie. So it’s almost unbelievable that, before his death in 2016, Bowie told Murphy it was OK for the LCD Soundsystem mastermind to reform the band a mere five years after their much ballyhooed “final show” at Madison Square Garden.\n\nFollowing his mentor’s advice, LCD played their first reunion show not long afterward. But fans would have to wait until 2017 for LCD’s comeback album, <i>american dream</i>. By then, Murphy had lost several musical heroes, including Bowie, Leonard Cohen and Alan Vega of Suicide (a band name-checked on the first LCD song, “Losing My Edge”). When <i>american dream</i> was finally released, Murphy told interviewers that he’d imagined Cohen doing a “spoken word bit” on the song “Black Screen” (ostensibly a tribute to Bowie) mere days before the 82-year-old Cohen’s passing. Clearly, time was slipping away.\n\nAlso slipping away: The 2000s indie-dance scene that had once viewed Murphy as a leading star. Sure, LCD Soundsystem’s beloved back catalogue could sell out concerts until the end of time. But Murphy was no longer a scenester darling—a point he addresses on <i>american dream</i>’s “I Used To”, which finds him singing, “I used to dance alone of my own volition.” The album’s “Emotional Haircut”, meanwhile, finds Murphy ignoring the 2000s altogether: With its intertwined guitar and drum exchange, the song recalls the early-1990s American post-hardcore scene that had chewed up and spit out Murphy early on in his music career. To quote Simone de Beauvoir, a philosopher often linked to none other than Bowie: “If you live long enough, you'll see that every victory turns into a defeat.”"

            "content": "American Dream (stylized on digital releases as american dream) is the  fourth studio album by American rock band LCD Soundsystem. It was released on September 1, 2017 through DFA Records and Columbia Records. It was first announced on January 5, 2016, the day after it was revealed that the band was reuniting after a disbandment lasting nearly five years. American Dream acts as the band's first album in seven years, following  This Is Happening from 2010. Prior to the album's release, LCD Soundsystem performed at large music festivals as well as smaller club shows to promote their reunion.
