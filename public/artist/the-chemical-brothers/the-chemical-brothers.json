  "biography": "The Chemical Brothers is an English electronic music duo formed by Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons in Manchester in 1989. They were pioneers (along with the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, the Crystal Method, and other acts) in bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. After attracting Virgin Records, the duo achieved further success with second album Dig Your Own Hole (1997), which topped the UK charts. In the UK, they have had six No. 1 albums and 13 top-20 singles, including two chart-toppers.\n\nTheir name came about in 1995 after they dropped their original moniker the Dust Brothers due to the existence of a different band with the same name. In the United States, they have won six Grammy Awards including Best Rock Instrumental Performance, Best Dance Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Album of the year as recently as 2020.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Brothers\n\nStudio albums\nExit Planet Dust (1995)\nDig Your Own Hole (1997)\nSurrender (1999)\nCome with Us (2002)\nPush the Button (2005)\nWe Are the Night (2007)\nFurther (2010)\nBorn in the Echoes (2015)\nNo Geography (2019)\nFor That Beautiful Feeling (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chemical+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
