  "biography": "THERAPY? is an alternative rock/punk rock band from Northern Ireland. The band was formed in 1989 by guitarist/vocalist Andy Cairns and drummer Fyfe Ewing. The band initially recorded their first demo with Andy filling in on bass guitar. To complete the line-up, the band recruited bassist Michael McKeegan.\nWith keen pop sensibilities, a skewed sense of humour and a willingness to draw inspiration from diverse sources (notably punk rock), Therapy? came to attention in the early 1990s rise of alternative rock, but have endured for more than a decade since; Critic Johnny Loftus writes, \"After a ten-plus year career that has seen them outlast competitors and outwit industry attempts at categorization, Therapy? are still headbangers with their thinking caps screwed on tight.\"\n\nCurrent line-up :\nAndy Cairns (guitar, vocals) (1989 - )\nMichael McKeegan (bass guitar, backing vocals) (1989 - )\nNeil Cooper (drums) (2003 - )\n\nPast members:\nFyfe Ewing (drums) (1989 - 1996)\nMartin McCarrick (cello, guitar, backing vocals) (1996 - 2004)\nGraham Hopkins (drums) (1996 - 2001)\n\nDiscography:\n-Hard Cold Fire (2023)\n-Cleave (2018)\n-Disquiet (2015)\n-A Brief Crack of Light (2012)\n-Crooked Timber (2009)\n-One Cure Fits All (2006)\n-Never Apologise Never Explain (2004)\n-High Anxiety (2003)\n-Shameless (2001)\n-So Much For The Ten Year Plan - A Retrospective 1990-2000 (2000)\n-Suicide Pact - You First (1999)\n-Semi-Detached (1998)\n-Infernal Love (1995)\n-Troublegum (1994)\n-Face the Strange E.P.
