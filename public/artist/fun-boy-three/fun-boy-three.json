  "biography": "After the break-up of the original line-up of The Specials; Terry Hall, Lynval Golding and Neville Staple broke away to form Fun Boy Three.\n\nTheir peculiar brand of politically driven retro-pop made an impression on the British pop charts during 1981-1982. Their biggest hit was Our Lips Are Sealed, a retread of Go-Go's 1981 song, which was co-written by Terry Hall. Other well-known tracks include The Lunatics (Have Taken Over The Asylum) and T'ain't What You Do (Its The Way That You Do It), recorded with the fledgling all-girl group Bananarama.\n\nFun Boy Three's music draws on influences such as vintage soul, ska, reggae, muzak and kitsch movie soundtracks.\n\nThe band split-up in 1984, and Terry hall went on to perform solo and also form The Colourfield. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fun+Boy+Three\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
