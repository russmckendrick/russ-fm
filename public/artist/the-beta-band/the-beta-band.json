  "biography": "The Beta Band were a British musical group formed in 1996. They were critically acclaimed and achieved a cult status. Their style was described as being \"folktronica\", a blend of folk, electronic, rock, trip hop, and experimental jamming.\n\nThe Beta Band disbanded in 2004 but during the course of their career, they were hailed by both Radiohead and Oasis.\n\nThe Beta Band formed in 1996 around St Andrews musicians Steve Mason (vocals, guitar) and Gordon Anderson. The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, Champion Versions, they added Robin Jones (drums) and John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards). Steve Duffield was the original bassist but quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and decided to quit the band. He would later produce recordings under the name Lone Pigeon. The remaining members added Englishman Richard Greentree (bass) and solidified their lineup.\n\nChampion Versions was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim not only for the music but also for the record's innovative cut-and-paste sleeve design (the work of John Maclean). Two further EPs followed in 1998: The Patty Patty Sound in March and Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos in July. The EPs were all subjects of widespread critical praise,\n\nand all three appeared on the appropriately titled The Three E.P.'s collection in September 1998. The compilation was rated by Pitchfork in the Top 10 Albums of the year. The song 'Dr Baker' featured on the acclaimed soundtrack of the first series Trigger Happy TV.\n\nThe band soon commenced work on their ambitious first full-length recording, pulling inspiration from sources as diverse as Jamaican reggae, Disney's movie The Black Hole and Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\". The record, simply titled The Beta Band, was released in June 1999. The first track, \"The Beta Band Rap\", managed to tell the band's back story over alternating bubblegum pop, rap and rockabilly backing tracks. Its eclecticism was representative of the rest of the album, which was widely perceived to be more stylistically diverse than the initial EPs. The mixed press turned decidedly negative when the band announced their own disdain for the record. They claimed that Regal's unreasonable deadline and tight budgets kept them from refining their improvisations into coherent songs.",

      "biography_en": "The Beta Band were a British musical group formed in 1996. They were critically acclaimed and achieved a cult status. Their style was described as being \"folktronica\", a blend of folk, electronic, rock, trip hop, and experimental jamming.\n\nThe Beta Band disbanded in 2004 but during the course of their career, they were hailed by both Radiohead and Oasis.\n\nThe Beta Band formed in 1996 around St Andrews musicians Steve Mason (vocals, guitar) and Gordon Anderson. The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, Champion Versions, they added Robin Jones (drums) and John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards). Steve Duffield was the original bassist but quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and decided to quit the band. He would later produce recordings under the name Lone Pigeon. The remaining members added Englishman Richard Greentree (bass) and solidified their lineup.\n\nChampion Versions was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim not only for the music but also for the record's innovative cut-and-paste sleeve design (the work of John Maclean). Two further EPs followed in 1998: The Patty Patty Sound in March and Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos in July. The EPs were all subjects of widespread critical praise,\n\nand all three appeared on the appropriately titled The Three E.P.'s collection in September 1998. The compilation was rated by Pitchfork in the Top 10 Albums of the year. The song 'Dr Baker' featured on the acclaimed soundtrack of the first series Trigger Happy TV.\n\nThe band soon commenced work on their ambitious first full-length recording, pulling inspiration from sources as diverse as Jamaican reggae, Disney's movie The Black Hole and Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\". The record, simply titled The Beta Band, was released in June 1999. The first track, \"The Beta Band Rap\", managed to tell the band's back story over alternating bubblegum pop, rap and rockabilly backing tracks. Its eclecticism was representative of the rest of the album, which was widely perceived to be more stylistically diverse than the initial EPs. The mixed press turned decidedly negative when the band announced their own disdain for the record. They claimed that Regal's unreasonable deadline and tight budgets kept them from refining their improvisations into coherent songs.",

      "bio_content": "The Beta Band  (originally 1996-2004, reformed 2025) are an indie rock group from Edinburgh, Scotland who received much critical acclaim and achieved a cult following. Their music primarily explored post-rock,—especially first wave post-rock—neo-psychedelia and indietronica, as well as foreshadowing folktronica.\n\nTheir music has been featured on numerous film and TV soundtracks. The song \"Dry the Rain\" from their 1997 debut EP, Champion Versions, later to be released on the 3 EP's album, was possibly their most popular track and was famously featured in the John Cusack film, High Fidelity. The song \"Smiling\" from the self titled album \"The Beta Band\" is the background music to the UK's Soccer AM, Cross-Bar challenge.   \"Needles in My Eyes\" was featured on a fourth season episode of House MD.\n\nWell known fans include John Cusack, Mani, from Primal Scream and Stone Roses and Noel Gallagher. \n\nTheir live performances were legendary, often ending with the whole band playing percussion. Their dancing and energy got the whole audience moving, often in the same style as their idols on stage. Their \"Best of\" CD contains a CD of them playing live at the Shepherds Bush Empire in one of their final gigs and  manages to capture some of this energy. It has been suggested, sometimes by the band themselves, that they were better live than recorded.\n \nSteve has now released an album under his own name after his post-Beta Band projects Black Affair and King Biscuit Time, John, Robin and Gordon Anderson aka Lone Pigeon have formed The Aliens (www.myspace.com/thealiens1) and Rich is The General & Duchess Collins. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beta+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "The Beta Band were a British musical group formed in 1996. They were critically acclaimed and achieved a cult status. Their style was described as being \"folktronica\", a blend of folk, electronic, rock, trip hop, and experimental jamming.\n\nThe Beta Band disbanded in 2004 but during the course of their career, they were hailed by both Radiohead and Oasis.\n\nThe Beta Band formed in 1996 around St Andrews musicians Steve Mason (vocals, guitar) and Gordon Anderson. The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, Champion Versions, they added Robin Jones (drums) and John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards). Steve Duffield was the original bassist but quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and decided to quit the band. He would later produce recordings under the name Lone Pigeon. The remaining members added Englishman Richard Greentree (bass) and solidified their lineup.\n\nChampion Versions was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim not only for the music but also for the record's innovative cut-and-paste sleeve design (the work of John Maclean). Two further EPs followed in 1998: The Patty Patty Sound in March and Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos in July. The EPs were all subjects of widespread critical praise,\n\nand all three appeared on the appropriately titled The Three E.P.'s collection in September 1998. The compilation was rated by Pitchfork in the Top 10 Albums of the year. The song 'Dr Baker' featured on the acclaimed soundtrack of the first series Trigger Happy TV.\n\nThe band soon commenced work on their ambitious first full-length recording, pulling inspiration from sources as diverse as Jamaican reggae, Disney's movie The Black Hole and Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\". The record, simply titled The Beta Band, was released in June 1999. The first track, \"The Beta Band Rap\", managed to tell the band's back story over alternating bubblegum pop, rap and rockabilly backing tracks. Its eclecticism was representative of the rest of the album, which was widely perceived to be more stylistically diverse than the initial EPs. The mixed press turned decidedly negative when the band announced their own disdain for the record. They claimed that Regal's unreasonable deadline and tight budgets kept them from refining their improvisations into coherent songs.",
