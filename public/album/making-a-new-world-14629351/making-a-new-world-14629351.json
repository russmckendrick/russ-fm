      "biography": "Field Music are a band from Sunderland, England who formed in 2004. The band's core consists of brothers David and Peter Brewis (who at one time played drums for fellow Sunderland band The Futureheads), with Andrew Moore featuring as pianist on the first two albums and as part of Peter Brewis's solo project The Week That Was. Their line-ups have at times featured members of both Maxïmo Park and The Futureheads. Previous incarnations include The New Tellers and Electronic Eye Machine.\n\nField Music released their eponymous debut album in August 2005. A collection of B-sides and earlier songs, Write Your Own History, was released in May 2006. Their second album, Tones Of Town, was released on January 22, 2007.\nIn an interview with BBC 6 Music in April 2007 the band claimed they were intending to split once the promotional engagements for Tones Of Town were completed in June 2007.\n\"We basically want to do things that aren't classed as 'Field Music indie band'. We're not going to be a band for a bit. But Field Music aren't going to be over because we've already got a bank account under the name, so we'll just continue as a company. It's time to go and do some real work.\"\nField Music later confirmed that the band has not split. On their official website the band members addressed the issue and reassured fans as they are still a band they simply wished it to be known that the band is a by-product of their existence, not their reason for it.\nDavid Brewis released an album as School Of Language in February 2008 through Memphis Industries (in the UK and Ireland) and Thrill Jockey Records (in the US and Europe), while Peter Brewis recorded an album under the name The Week That Was which was released on 18 August 2008, also with Memphis Industries, and featured both David Brewis and Andrew Moore on some tracks.\nIn an interview with Stereogum in July 2009, the band confirmed that they had reunited (minus Andrew Moore) and were busy recording a third Field Music record. The 20 tune album, titled 'Field Music (Measure)' was released through Memphis Industries in February, 2010 (Feb. 15 in the UK, Feb. 16 in the US).\nField Music have been celebrated as one of the few bands to transcend and outlast the short-lived NME-generated \"post-punk revival\" of the mid-noughties. Describing the band as \"a truly artful proposition in the pseud-filled landscape of contemporary Brit art-rock\", music blog The Fantastic Hope puts this down in part to their \"un-self-conscious anti-fashion stance\", arguing that Field Music's \"wayward pop from the fringes of academia is one of the most worthwhile ways in which rock//indie/guitar music/white pop/whatever might evolve\".\nThe band was chosen personally by Belle & Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow's Parties in the UK in December 2010.\nTheir fourth album, Plumb, was released on February 13, 2012. It was preceded by the song \"(I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing\", available as a free download from their website. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize that year.\nIn September 2013, it was revealed that Field Music had composed a soundtrack for the 1929 silent documentary Drifters.  The film, which originally premiered alongside Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin, was made by pioneering Scottish director John Grierson and follows the working day of a herring fishing fleet as it sets sail from the Shetland Islands. Field Music premiered the work with a live performance and screening for Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival. This commission sees the original line-up of Peter Brewis, David Brewis and Andrew Moore reunite for the first time since 2007. A subsequent screening and performance was planned for London’s Islington Assembly Hall in November 2013. \nDavid Brewis played with former Fiery Furnaces singer Eleanor Friedberger on her UK tour in the summer of 2013. \nIn an interview with Songfacts.com, legendary guitarist and producer Al Kooper said that Field Music is his favorite new band.",

After a 2019 audio-visual performance commemorating the World War I armistice centenary for the Imperial War Museum, David and Peter Brewis used the project as a jumping-off point to begin their seventh studio album. Focusing on war and its life-altering consequences, this loosely conceptual song cycle returns to the terse progressive arrangements of 2012’s Mercury Prize-nominated <i>Plumb</i>. The songs are subject to open interpretation, alluding to war narrative tropes and fleshing out the people behind them: the soldier who returns home (“Coffee or Wine”); an office worker preparing the final payment of war reparations (“Money Is a Memory”); a family that settle in through a subsidised housing scheme (“Best Kept Garden”). The swaggering funk of “Only in a Man’s World” is a commentary on how society views the use of sanitary pads, and how its marketing towards women hasn’t changed—just one example of how the innovations and advancements of the time still impact us today.",

            "content": "Field Music’s new release is “Making A New World”, a 19 track song cycle about the after-effects of the First World War. But this is not an album about war and it is not, in any traditional sense, an album about remembrance. There are songs here about air traffic control and gender reassignment surgery. There are songs about Tiananmen Square and about ultrasound. There are even songs about Becontree Housing Estate and about sanitary towels.\n\nThe songs grew from a project for the Imperial War Museum and were first performed at their sites in Salford and London in January 2019. The starting point was an image from a 1919 publication on munitions by the US War Department, made using “sound ranging”, a technique that utilised an array of transducers to capture the vibrations of gunfire at the front. These vibrations were displayed on a graph, similar to a seismograph, where the distances between peaks on different lines could be used to pinpoint the location of enemy armaments. This particular image showed the minute leading up to 11am on 11th November 1918, and the minute immediately after. One minute of oppressive, juddering noise and one minute of near-silence. “We imagined the lines from that image continuing across the next hundred years,” says the band’s David Brewis, “and we looked for stories which tied back to specific events from the war or the immediate aftermath.” If the original intention might have been to create a mostly instrumental piece, this research forced and inspired a different approach. These were stories itching to be told.\n\nThe songs are in a kind of chronological order, starting with the end of the war itself; the uncertainty of heading home in a profoundly altered world (“Coffee or Wine”). Later we hear a song about the work of Dr Harold Gillies (the shimmering ballad, “A Change of Heir”), whose pioneering work on skin grafts for injured servicemen led him, in the 1940s, to perform some of the very first gender reassignment surgeries.

But this is not an album about war and it is not, in any traditional sense, an album about remembrance. There are songs here about air traffic control and gender reassignment surgery. There are songs about Tiananmen Square and about ultrasound. There are even songs about Becontree Housing Estate and about sanitary towels.\n\nThe songs grew from a project for the Imperial War Museum and were first performed at their sites in Salford and London in January 2019. The starting point was an image from a 1919 publication on munitions by the US War Department, made using “sound ranging”, a technique that utilised an array of transducers to capture the vibrations of gunfire at the front. These vibrations were displayed on a graph, similar to a seismograph, where the distances between peaks on different lines could be used to pinpoint the location of enemy armaments. This particular image showed the minute leading up to 11am on 11th November 1918, and the minute immediately after. One minute of oppressive, juddering noise and one minute of near-silence. “We imagined the lines from that image continuing across the next hundred years,” says the band’s David Brewis, “and we looked for stories which tied back to specific events from the war or the immediate aftermath.” If the original intention might have been to create a mostly instrumental piece, this research forced and inspired a different approach. These were stories itching to be told.\n\nThe songs are in a kind of chronological order, starting with the end of the war itself; the uncertainty of heading home in a profoundly altered world (“Coffee or Wine”). Later we hear a song about the work of Dr Harold Gillies (the shimmering ballad, “A Change of Heir”), whose pioneering work on skin grafts for injured servicemen led him, in the 1940s, to perform some of the very first gender reassignment surgeries. We see how the horrors of the war led to the Dada movement and how that artistic reaction was echoed in the extreme performance art of the 60s and 70s (the mathematical head-spin of “A Shot To The Arm”). And then in the funk stomp of Money Is A Memory, we picture an office worker in the German Treasury preparing documents for the final instalment on reparation debts - a payment made in 2010, 91 years after the Treaty of Versailles was signed.
