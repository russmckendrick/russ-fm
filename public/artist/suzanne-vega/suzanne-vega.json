  "biography": "Suzanne Vega (born Suzanne Nadine Vega on 11 July 1959 in Santa Monica, California) is an American singer-songwriter noted for her eclectic folk-inspired music. Two of Vega's songs (both from her second album Solitude Standing, 1987) reached the top 10 of various international chart listings: \" Luka\" and \"Tom's Diner\". \n\nThough born in California, Vega has lived most of her life in New York City. There, she attended the High School of the Performing Arts (the school seen in the feature film musical Fame), where she studied modern dance. Vega realized that her talent in dance was not sufficient to make her living. While pursuing a degree in English at Columbia University, she penned many songs, and performed in college and community coffeehouses inside and outside the New York City area.\n\nShe was discovered in 1984, releasing her eponymous debut the following year. However, it was not until her 1987 sophomore effort, Solitude Standing, that Vega entered the U.S. mainstream with the lyrically unlikely hit Luka. Three years later, a remix of the album's opening track \"Tom's Diner\" became an American and European hit for \"DNA Featuring Suzanne Vega.\" \n\nHaving continuously built and maintained a loyal fanbase since her fame's peak, Vega has a prolific catalogue, and in 2003 she released a retrospective collection. Beauty & Crime, her seventh album, was released in 2007. Inspired by the city where Vega grew up and still currently resides, Beauty & Crime revolves around her experiences in New York. \n\nVega has a daughter, Ruby Froom, with her ex-husband Mitchell Froom. In early 2006, Vega remarried to a man named Paul Mills.\n\nFor additional information, including photographs, visit Suzanne Vega's official website, www.SuzanneVega.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Suzanne+Vega\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
