      "biography": "The Decemberists are an indie folk rock band from Portland, Oregon, United States, fronted by singer/songwriter Colin Meloy. The other members of the band are Chris Funk (guitar, multi-instrumentalist), Jenny Conlee (Hammond organ, accordion, melodica, piano, keyboards, harmonica), Nate Query (bass guitar, string bass), and John Moen (drums, backing vocals, melodica, guitar).\n\nIn addition to their lyrics, which often focus on historical incidents and/or folklore, The Decemberists are also well known for their eclectic live shows. Audience participation is often a part of each performance, typically during encores. The band stages whimsical reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd. During their European tour in the winter of 2010, the band performed \"The Mariner's Revenge Song\" at the conclusion of each date. The audience was encouraged to scream as if they were being consumed by a whale mentioned in the track's narrative while the band pretended to die on stage. In 2011, the track \"Down by the Water\" from the album The King is Dead was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards.\n\nThe group's songs range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads, and often employ instruments like the accordion, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer organ, and upright bass. In its lyrics, the band eschews the introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as \"My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist\" from the 5 Songs EP and \"The Mariner's Revenge Song\" on Picaresque. The band's songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (\"The Sporting Life\") to epic (\"The Tain\") to dark (\"Odalisque\", \"The Rake's Song\"), and often invoke historical events and themes from around the world (\"Yankee Bayonet\", \"The Bagman's Gambit\").\n\nOn their website, the group claim that their official drink is Orangina, that they love the video-game Bioshock and \"adore\" the bands Norfolk & Western, Explosions In The Sky, The Postal Service, The Long Winters, Death Cab for Cutie, Dokken, Ulrich Schnauss, El Ten Eleven, The Shins, The Octopus Project, Electrelane, Camera Obscura, Clearlake, The Thermals, Modest Mouse, Swords and Earlimart. The band's official biography, keeping up their reputation for grandiloquence, also describes how they met in a Turkish bath. A footnote following the biography claims, \"The Decemberists travel exclusively by Dr. Herring's Brand Dirigible Balloons.\" Colin Meloy has listed Anne Briggs, Nic Jones, and Shirley Collins – who led the 1960s British folk revival – as major influences on The Hazards of Love. Meloy has also confessed a \"slavish love\" for Morrissey, one of his principal influences. The band has also cited their liking for Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the pop tunes of R.E.M. and XTC. The band also draws inspiration from British and Irish folk music.",

      "editorial_notes": "The Decemberists’ first album in six years feels like a homecoming. After the sombre and reflective <i>What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World</i> in 2015 and the synth-laden protest songs of 2018’s <i>I’ll Be Your Girl</i>, their ninth LP, <i>As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again</i>—their first-ever double album—is a freewheeling and deeply pleasurable odyssey through the Portland folk-rockers’ estimable history. No stone in the band’s past is left unturned here: There are echoes of the wistfulness that drew so many listeners in circa 2002’s instant classic <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i>, as well as the flamboyant instrumentation and arched-eyebrow storytelling that marked 2005’s star-making <i>Picaresque</i>. Even <i>As It Ever Was</i>’ stormy and surprisingly bruising closer, the nearly 20-minute “Joan in the Garden”, instantly recalls the band’s 2009 proggy opus <i>The Hazards of Love</i> in its “Aqualung”-esque stomp, complete with meaty guitar riffs.\n\nAt first glance, Colin Meloy and co. are doing a lot across the ample framework of <i>As It Ever Was</i>—but their successfully executed sense of ambition is perfectly complemented by the sweet musical simplicity of these 13 songs, some of Meloy’s most straightforwardly gorgeous music put to tape. Accompanied by The Shins’ James Mercer and R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills, the easy jangle of “Burial Ground” is practically The Decemberists’ own take on The Byrds’ classic “Turn! Turn! Turn!” while “America Made Me” leavens Meloy’s acerbic sociopolitical observations with a horn-laden bar-band boisterousness. “Don’t want stunning wordplay/All I want is you,” Meloy nakedly intones on “All I Want Is You”, perhaps a cheeky self-referential moment towards his own penchant for lyrical verbosity. But <i>As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again</i> reaffirms that The Decemberists are at their strongest when embracing their most long-held creative tendencies.",
