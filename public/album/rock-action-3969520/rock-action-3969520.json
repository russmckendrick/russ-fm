      "biography": "Mogwai are a Scottish post-rock band, formed in 1995 in Glasgow. The band consists of Stuart Braithwaite (guitar, vocals), John Cummings (guitar, vocals), Barry Burns (guitar, piano, synthesizer, vocals), Dominic Aitchison (bass guitar), and Martin Bulloch (drum kit). The band typically compose lengthy guitar-based instrumental pieces that feature dynamic contrast, melodic bass guitar lines, and heavy use of distortion and effects.\n\nStuart Braithwaite and Dominic Aitchison originally met in April 1991, and four years later added old schoolfriend Martin Bulloch to their ranks, forming the band Mogwai in the process. The band is named after the creatures from the film Gremlins, although guitarist Stuart Braithwaite comments that \"it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one, but like a lot of other things we never got round to it.\" 'Mogwai' means \"evil spirit\" or \"devil\" in Cantonese. The band debuted in February 1996 with the \"Tuner\"/\"Lower\" single and by the end of the year they received 'single of the week' from NME for \"Summer\", a feat repeated early in 1997 with \"New Paths to Helicon\".\n\nThe band's influences include Fugazi, MC5, My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, and post-rock pioneers Slint. During 2004, the band supported tours by two major influences, Pixies and The Cure. Mogwai's style has easily identifiable connections to genres like shoegazing, math rock, art rock and occasionally instrumental metal. Debut album Mogwai Young Team was described as \"stunningly dynamic... seamlessly from tranquil, bleakly beautiful soundscapes to brain scrambling white noise and sledgehammer riffing\".\n\nIn 2006, the band provided the soundtrack to the film Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, with the soundtrack album released the following year. The band also collaborated with Clint Mansell on the soundtrack to The Fountain in 2006.",

            "content": "Rock Action is the third full-length studio album by Scottish post-rock band Mogwai. Rock Action brought with it some changes to Mogwai's sound that they would continue to develop later, including the use of electronic instruments. While song structures on this album are typical of the band in most cases and respects, some of the contrasting dynamics have been toned down slightly and many of the songs focus more on texture than on structure. For the first time, Mogwai utilised synthesizers, expanding their timbral palette. The single \"Dial: Revenge\" fills much the same role that \"Cody\" did on Come on Die Young, featuring Welsh vocals from Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals;. When the inside cover is unfolded, part of the logo for Mwng, an album by Super Furry Animals released the previous year, can be seen. Gruff Rhys has said of the song title \"I think (Mogwai) were into me writing in Welsh, because they're an instrumental band and they wanted a singer who would be just sounds for most people. Back then, people were still using payphones. When you take a payphone off the hook, on the LCD screen it flashes 'DIAL'. But in Welsh, dial – pronounced 'dee-al' – means revenge. It puts you in a weird place when you're making a phone call. So the song was about that.\".\n\nThe tone of Rock Action is somewhat less dark than previous works, but maintains Mogwai's cryptic cynicism.\n\nThe album's title comes from Iggy Pop's nickname for his Stooges bandmate, Scott Asheton. Pop had at times referred to him as \"Rock\" Asheton, or \"Rock Action\". He later changed his name to this nickname.\n\nThe album was produced by Dave Fridmann of Mercury Rev in New York. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mogwai/Rock+Action\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
