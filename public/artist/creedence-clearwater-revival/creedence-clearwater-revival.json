  "biography": "Creedence Clearwater Revival (often referred to as Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s which consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford.\n\nThese members played together since 1959, first as The Blue Velvets, then as The Golliwogs. Their musical style encompassed the roots rock, swamp rock, and blues rock genres. They played in a Southern rock style, despite their San Francisco Bay Area origin, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War. The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival in Upstate New York.\n\nThe group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year, and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits among the former bandmates. Fogerty's ongoing disagreements with Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz created further protracted court battles, and John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving members at CCR's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival's music is still a staple of US radio airplay; the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone. Rolling Stone ranked them 82nd on its Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.\n\nJohn Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook met at Portola Junior High School in El Cerrito, California. Calling themselves the Blue Velvets, the trio began playing instrumentals and \"juke box standards\", as well as backing Fogerty's older brother Tom at live gigs and in the recording studio. Tom soon joined the band, and in 1964 they signed with Fantasy Records, an independent jazz label in San Francisco that had released Cast Your Fate To The Wind, a national hit for jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. The record's success was the subject of a National Educational Television special, which prompted budding songwriter John Fogerty to contact the label. For the band's first release, Fantasy co-owner Max Weiss renamed the group the Golliwogs (after the children's literary character, Golliwogg).\n\nBandmembers' roles and the instruments they played changed during this period. Stu Cook switched from piano to bass guitar and Tom Fogerty from lead vocals to rhythm guitar; John became the band's lead vocalist and primary songwriter. In Tom Fogerty's words: \"I could sing, but John had a sound!\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "profile": "Creedence Clearwater Revival (often known as \"CCR\") were an American rock band, active 1967–1972, formed by John Fogerty (Vocals And Guitar), Tom Fogerty (Rhythm Guitar), Stu Cook (Bass), and Doug \"Cosmo\" Clifford (Drums).  Despite being from Berkeley, California, the band's music usually invoked imagery of the American South.\r\n\r\nJohn Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford initially joined forces in 1959 as The Blue Velvets and later backed John's older brother, Tom, as Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets.  The group later changed their name to the Golliwogs and released several unsuccessful singles.  In 1967, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival and John Fogerty took total control of the group.  CCR was extremely prolific, releasing 6 albums and various singles between 1968 and 1970.  However, the other members of the band chafed under John Fogerty's domination and in 1971 it was announced that Tom Fogerty had left the band.  CCR made one more album, 1972's \"Mardi Gras\", as a trio.  In the wake of Tom's departure, John, responding the other members' requests to have more say in band matters, stipulated that both Cook and Clifford had to contribute equally to the writing and recording.  The album was poorly received and CCR subsequently split.\r\n\r\nIn the years following their split, the animosities between John and the other members grew.  When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1993, John infamously barred Cook and Clifford from the stage (Tom had passed away in 1990).  In 1995, Cook and Clifford formed [a2540427]",

        "profile": "Creedence Clearwater Revival (often known as \"CCR\") were an American rock band, active 1967–1972, formed by John Fogerty (Vocals And Guitar), Tom Fogerty (Rhythm Guitar), Stu Cook (Bass), and Doug \"Cosmo\" Clifford (Drums).  Despite being from Berkeley, California, the band's music usually invoked imagery of the American South.\r\n\r\nJohn Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford initially joined forces in 1959 as The Blue Velvets and later backed John's older brother, Tom, as Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets.  The group later changed their name to the Golliwogs and released several unsuccessful singles.  In 1967, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival and John Fogerty took total control of the group.  CCR was extremely prolific, releasing 6 albums and various singles between 1968 and 1970.  However, the other members of the band chafed under John Fogerty's domination and in 1971 it was announced that Tom Fogerty had left the band.  CCR made one more album, 1972's \"Mardi Gras\", as a trio.  In the wake of Tom's departure, John, responding the other members' requests to have more say in band matters, stipulated that both Cook and Clifford had to contribute equally to the writing and recording.  The album was poorly received and CCR subsequently split.\r\n\r\nIn the years following their split, the animosities between John and the other members grew.  When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1993, John infamously barred Cook and Clifford from the stage (Tom had passed away in 1990).  In 1995, Cook and Clifford formed [a2540427]",

      "bio_content": "Creedence Clearwater Revival (often referred to as Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s which consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford.\n\nThese members played together since 1959, first as The Blue Velvets, then as The Golliwogs. Their musical style encompassed the roots rock, swamp rock, and blues rock genres. They played in a Southern rock style, despite their San Francisco Bay Area origin, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War. The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival in Upstate New York.\n\nThe group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year, and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits among the former bandmates. Fogerty's ongoing disagreements with Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz created further protracted court battles, and John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving members at CCR's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival's music is still a staple of US radio airplay; the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone. Rolling Stone ranked them 82nd on its Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.\n\nJohn Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook met at Portola Junior High School in El Cerrito, California. Calling themselves the Blue Velvets, the trio began playing instrumentals and \"juke box standards\", as well as backing Fogerty's older brother Tom at live gigs and in the recording studio. Tom soon joined the band, and in 1964 they signed with Fantasy Records, an independent jazz label in San Francisco that had released Cast Your Fate To The Wind, a national hit for jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. The record's success was the subject of a National Educational Television special, which prompted budding songwriter John Fogerty to contact the label. For the band's first release, Fantasy co-owner Max Weiss renamed the group the Golliwogs (after the children's literary character, Golliwogg).\n\nBandmembers' roles and the instruments they played changed during this period. Stu Cook switched from piano to bass guitar and Tom Fogerty from lead vocals to rhythm guitar; John became the band's lead vocalist and primary songwriter. In Tom Fogerty's words: \"I could sing, but John had a sound!\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
