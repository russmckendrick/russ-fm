      "biography": "Pet Shop Boys are an English electronic dance music duo, consisting of Neil Tennant, who provides main vocals, keyboards and occasional guitar, and Chris Lowe on keyboards.\nOne of the world's best-selling music artists, Pet Shop Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide and are listed as the most successful duo in UK music history by The Guinness Book of Records. Three-time Brit Award winners and six-time Grammy nominees, since 1986 they have achieved 42 Top 30 singles and 22 Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart, including four number ones: \"West End Girls\", \"It's a Sin\", \"Always on My Mind\" and \"Heart\".\nAt the 2009 BRIT Awards, Pet Shop Boys received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The duo's latest studio album, Yes (continuing their tradition of single word titles) was released on 23 March 2009. The band's eleventh studio album, titled Elysium is due for release in September 2012, the first single of which, titled \"Winner\", was released on 2 July 2012.\nNeil Tennant and Chris Lowe met in an electronics shop on Kings Road in Chelsea, London in August 1981. Recognising a mutual interest in dance music, they began to work on material together, first in Tennant's flat in Chelsea and from 1982, in a small studio in Camden Town. It was during those early years that several future hit songs were created, including \"It's a Sin\", \"West End Girls\", \"Rent\" and \"Jealousy\".\nStarting out, the two called themselves West End because of their love of London's West End, but later they came up with the name Pet Shop Boys, derived from friends of theirs who worked in a pet shop in Ealing. Their big break came in August 1983, when Tennant was assigned by Smash Hits to interview The Police in New York. The duo were obsessed with a stream of Hi-NRG records made by New York producer Bobby Orlando, simply known as Bobby 'O'. According to Tennant: \"I thought: well, if I've got to go and see The Police play, then I'm also going to have lunch with Bobby 'O'.\" They shared a cheeseburger and carrot cake, at a restaurant called the Apple Jack, on 19 August (two years to the day since Tennant and Lowe had met) and, after hearing a demo tape that Tennant had brought along with him, Orlando suggested making a record with the Pet Shop Boys.\nIn April 1984, the Orlando-produced \"West End Girls\" was released, becoming a club hit in Los Angeles and San Francisco. On 2 November, it was voted \"Screamer of the Week\" by listeners of Long Island, New York radio station WLIR. It was a minor dance hit in Belgium, and France, but was only available in the United Kingdom as a 12\" import.",

      "editorial_notes": "Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have said that when the Pet Shop Boys’ second album, <i>Actually</i>, was released, they mainly understood it to be about Thatcherism. Written during the mid 1980s and released in 1987—the year Thatcher began her third term as prime minister—<i>Actually</i> is a prickly record that captures a maudlin national consciousness. But the Pet Shop Boys dress up that dour mood in precisely sequenced, discotheque-indebted synth-pop. \n\nWhile the band’s debut album, <i>Please</i>, had its moments of bleakness, there was a romantic optimism that ran through it. On <i>Actually</i>, the overarching atmosphere is far more scathing. The robotic “Shopping” draws comparisons between vapid consumerism and the British government’s willingness to sell off nationalised industries and social housing (“I heard it in the House of Commons,” Tennant sings. “Everything’s for sale.”) The repetitive chug of “Rent”, meanwhile, turns salacious sexual transaction into something resigned and monotonous. And “King’s Cross”,with its sumptuous and slightly baroque production, encapsulates the despondency of the era; as Tennant sings with a sigh: “Wake up in the morning and there’s still no guarantee.” \n\nAt the heart of <i>Actually</i> are three songs about the HIV/AIDS crisis and the rise of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. While “Hit Music” appears to be a satirical look at banal commercialised pop songs, hidden in the lyrics is Tennant’s mourning at the loss of hedonistic queer nightlife (“Live and die, it’s all that we know.”) The pomp of “It’s a Sin”, arguably one of the Pet Shop Boys’ most recognisable hits, masks the pain of repressed sexuality and dogmatic bigotry (“When I look back upon my life/It’s always with a sense of shame.”) Finally, “It Couldn’t Happen Here”, with its initial sense of soft naivety, morphs into a gutting elegy for the lives lost because of HIV/AIDS, one that aches with regret (“I may be wrong, I thought we said/‘It couldn’t happen here’”). \n\nLevity comes in the form of “What Have I Done to Deserve This?”, in which Tennant and Lowe revive a career-declining Dusty Springfield, and “Heart”, an absolute floor-filling romp of song that was, according to the band, written with Madonna in mind. It’s all proof of the Pet Shop Boys’ ability to serve you socio-economic commentary and straight-up pop perfection at the same time.",
