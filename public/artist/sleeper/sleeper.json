  "biography": "Sleeper were a British Britpop band in the 1990s fronted by Louise Wener. The band had eight UK Top 40 hit singles and three UK Top 10 albums. Their music was also featured in the soundtrack of Trainspotting.\n\nJon Stewart met Louise Wener at Manchester University in 1987 in a political philosophy class. They played in a number of bands at university, then after graduating they moved to London and advertised for new band members in the Melody Maker (\"Bass player and drummer wanted. Influences The Pixies and The Partridge Family\") which is how they met Diid Osman and Andy Maclure.\nAt one point, the band called themselves Surrender Dorothy, after the smoke trail in the sky from the Wizard of Oz movie, but they had to ditch this idea after discovering that several other bands had done the same thing. They subsequently chose the name 'Sleeper' after the Woody Allen movie, and because it has a number of different meanings (a spy, an unexpected hit, etc.).\nAfter moving to Camden and receiving interest from record labels, Sleeper signed to BMG/RCA offshoot Indolent Records in 1993 and released three EPs and singles before their breakthrough release, \"Inbetweener\".\nCertain parts of the promo video for \"Inbetweener\" parodied the grocery store-set ITV game show Supermarket Sweep and featured the programme's presenter Dale Winton. Prior to the release of \"Inbetweener\" Sleeper had been the opening band for Blur on their tour to promote the Parklife album, and they became closely associated with Britpop as a result.\nSleeper recorded three studio albums for Indolent and BMG/RCA: Smart, The It Girl and Pleased to Meet You.\nSmart was one of the first Britpop albums to hit the charts and won the band a BPI gold disc for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was followed by the platinum-selling release The It Girl which was arguably the band's finest moment and included \"What Do I Do Now?\", \"Lie Detector\", \"Sale of the Century\" and \"Statuesque\" as the defining tracks.\nSleeper recorded a cover of the Blondie song \"Atomic\", which was used in the film Trainspotting, after Blondie refused to allow the use of the original version. Their track \"Statuesque\" also features in the movie during one of the bar scenes.\nThe It Girl, like the band's subsequent release Pleased to Meet You, was produced by Stephen Street who was then famous for his contributions to The Smiths, Morrissey and Blur, and is since renowned for his work with Kaiser Chiefs and others.\nLouise Wener was arguably, along with Elastica's Justine Frischmann, Britpop's biggest female star. She was even something of a sex symbol, placing highly in Melody Maker's and NME's \"Sexiest Woman\" polls two years running. Wener enjoyed significant media coverage, including an NME front cover and a slot as guest presenter of Top of the Pops. Her song \"What Do I Do Now?\" was covered by Elvis Costello in 1997.\nAfter the band split in 1998 following the demise of Britpop, Wener went on to have a career as a novelist. She released her fourth book for Hodder & Stoughton in 2008. Wener also features prominently as an interviewee in John Dower's feature film documentary on Britpop, Live Forever (2003).\nA greatest hits compilation, with tracklisting and artwork by the band themselves, was released on Sony/BMG in 2007.\nTheir first two albums were reissued as deluxe versions on 29 November 2010, with second discs of B-Sides and live tracks.",

A garage rock band from Oklahoma formed in 2008.\\n5. 90s emo / post hardcore band from Staten Island, NY. Later changed their name to Serpico after getting paid off by the English band.\\n\\n1. Sleeper was a Britpop group which formed in 1993 in Manchester, England. The band consisted of Louise Wener (vocals, guitar), Jon Stewart (guitar), Diid Osman (bass) and Andy Maclure (drums). The band released three albums -  Smart, The It Girl and Pleased to Meet You - and split in 1998.\\n\\nTheir breakthrough song, Inbetweener, featured a memorable video with Dale Winton, who was a popular icon among students at the time.  Sleeper also recorded a cover version of the Blondie song Atomic, which was used as a track in the film Trainspotting. Their version was quite well-received and the only criticism is that it was too similar to the original.\\n\\nThe It Girl was arguably their finest moment with Lie Detector, Sale of the Century and Statuesque as the defining tracks. It was produced by Stephen Street then famous for his contributions to The Smiths, Morrissey and Blur. It captured the imagination of the Britpop era. Wener admits that they were basically hanging onto the coattails of the bigger bands including the likes of Blur and Oasis.\\n\\nThe original band name for the band was Surrender Dorothy. They took that name from the smoke trail telling Dorothy to surrender in the Wizard of Oz movie. \\nAfter the band\\'s split Louise Wener went on to have a successful career as a novelist.\\n\\nThe band was the inspiration for the phrase \"Sleeperbloke\", referring to the disparity between the glamorous singer Wener and the other frequently ignored members of the band (who tended to be far more anonymous and stood at the back). The term is still used by music press journalists and musicians, to refer to any person of limited standing within a band or an especially drab and unremarkable individual. Sleeper were said to be amused by the term and even produced an ironic \"Sleeperbloke\" T-shirt which sold well\\n\\nThe real-life Sleeperblokes were:\\n\\nJon Stewart (born Jonathan David Stewart, 12 September 1967 in Sheffield) — (guitarist) \\nDiid Osman (b. Kenadiid Osman, 10 April 1968 in Woking) — (bassist) \\nAndy McClure (b. 4 July 1970 in Liverpool) — (drummer) \\nDiscography\\nAlbums\\nSmart - Feb 1995, #5 \\nThe It Girl - May 1996, #5 \\nPleased To Meet You - Oct 1997, #7 \\nSingles\\nSwallow- Jan 1994 \\nDelicious- May 1994 \\nInbetweener - Jan 1995, #16 (UK Chart) \\nVegas - Apr 1995, #33 \\nWhat Do I Do Now - Oct 1995, #14 \\nSale Of The Century - May 1996, #10 \\nNice Guy Eddie - Jul 1996, #10 \\nStatuesque - Oct 1996, #17 \\nShe\\'s A Good Girl - Oct 1997, #28 \\nRomeo Me - Dec 1997, #39 \\n\\n2. Electronic music producer from Coventry specializing in darker styles of dubstep (\"Mass Transference EP\" Pt 1/2), and techno (\"Enter\" EP). Minimalist yet detailed razor sharp bass music.   Often collaborates with District.\\nwww.facebook.com/pages/Sleeper/113978267823\\nsleepermadethesethings.blogspot.com\\nsoundcloud.com/sleepermusic\\n\\n3. \"Sleeper is a auteur of claustrophobic, sample-based hip-hop production. His work, both as an accomplished musician, and as a respected tattoo and visual artist balances a breadth of spirit with worldly, emotional depth. Finding influence and community in the worlds of classic hip-hop and artistic, experimental rock, Sleeper fills his tracks with sound, leaving an MC with just enough room to create or with the luxury of saying more by saying less. His music is lo-fi with purpose: grainy sounds are used to lend atmosphere to larger, modern electronic sound collages, grimy drums sound out familiar hip-hop patterns beneath thick layers of sound. Sleeper is a craftsman in the truest sense of the word.\"\\n\\n4. Sleeper is a raucous punk trio from Oklahoma, formed in the latter half of 2008. They have released a single tape to date, on their own Excitable Boy tape label.  \\n\\n5. Sleeper were a 90s emo/post hardcore band from Staten Island, New York. After a few releases as Sleeper, they were forced to change their name because of the existence of the UK group Sleeper, with the same name. They then changed their name to Serpico.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sleeper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sleeper was a Britpop group which formed in 1993 in Manchester, England. The band consisted of Louise Wener (vocals, guitar), Jon Stewart (guitar), Diid Osman (bass) and Andy Maclure (drums). The band released three albums -  Smart, The It Girl and Pleased to Meet You - and split in 1998.\\n\\nTheir breakthrough song, Inbetweener, featured a memorable video with Dale Winton, who was a popular icon among students at the time.  Sleeper also recorded a cover version of the Blondie song Atomic, which was used as a track in the film Trainspotting. Their version was quite well-received and the only criticism is that it was too similar to the original.\\n\\nThe It Girl was arguably their finest moment with Lie Detector, Sale of the Century and Statuesque as the defining tracks. It was produced by Stephen Street then famous for his contributions to The Smiths, Morrissey and Blur. It captured the imagination of the Britpop era. Wener admits that they were basically hanging onto the coattails of the bigger bands including the likes of Blur and Oasis.\\n\\nThe original band name for the band was Surrender Dorothy. They took that name from the smoke trail telling Dorothy to surrender in the Wizard of Oz movie. \\nAfter the band\\'s split Louise Wener went on to have a successful career as a novelist.\\n\\nThe band was the inspiration for the phrase \"Sleeperbloke\", referring to the disparity between the glamorous singer Wener and the other frequently ignored members of the band (who tended to be far more anonymous and stood at the back). The term is still used by music press journalists and musicians, to refer to any person of limited standing within a band or an especially drab and unremarkable individual. Sleeper were said to be amused by the term and even produced an ironic \"Sleeperbloke\" T-shirt which sold well\\n\\nThe real-life Sleeperblokes were:\\n\\nJon Stewart (born Jonathan David Stewart, 12 September 1967 in Sheffield) — (guitarist) \\nDiid Osman (b.

Electronic music producer from Coventry specializing in darker styles of dubstep (\"Mass Transference EP\" Pt 1/2), and techno (\"Enter\" EP). Minimalist yet detailed razor sharp bass music.   Often collaborates with District.\\nwww.facebook.com/pages/Sleeper/113978267823\\nsleepermadethesethings.blogspot.com\\nsoundcloud.com/sleepermusic\\n\\n3. \"Sleeper is a auteur of claustrophobic, sample-based hip-hop production. His work, both as an accomplished musician, and as a respected tattoo and visual artist balances a breadth of spirit with worldly, emotional depth. Finding influence and community in the worlds of classic hip-hop and artistic, experimental rock, Sleeper fills his tracks with sound, leaving an MC with just enough room to create or with the luxury of saying more by saying less. His music is lo-fi with purpose: grainy sounds are used to lend atmosphere to larger, modern electronic sound collages, grimy drums sound out familiar hip-hop patterns beneath thick layers of sound. Sleeper is a craftsman in the truest sense of the word.\"\\n\\n4. Sleeper is a raucous punk trio from Oklahoma, formed in the latter half of 2008. They have released a single tape to date, on their own Excitable Boy tape label.  \\n\\n5. Sleeper were a 90s emo/post hardcore band from Staten Island, New York. After a few releases as Sleeper, they were forced to change their name because of the existence of the UK group Sleeper, with the same name.

      "biography_en": "Sleeper were a British Britpop band in the 1990s fronted by Louise Wener. The band had eight UK Top 40 hit singles and three UK Top 10 albums. Their music was also featured in the soundtrack of Trainspotting.\n\nJon Stewart met Louise Wener at Manchester University in 1987 in a political philosophy class. They played in a number of bands at university, then after graduating they moved to London and advertised for new band members in the Melody Maker (\"Bass player and drummer wanted. Influences The Pixies and The Partridge Family\") which is how they met Diid Osman and Andy Maclure.\nAt one point, the band called themselves Surrender Dorothy, after the smoke trail in the sky from the Wizard of Oz movie, but they had to ditch this idea after discovering that several other bands had done the same thing. They subsequently chose the name 'Sleeper' after the Woody Allen movie, and because it has a number of different meanings (a spy, an unexpected hit, etc.).\nAfter moving to Camden and receiving interest from record labels, Sleeper signed to BMG/RCA offshoot Indolent Records in 1993 and released three EPs and singles before their breakthrough release, \"Inbetweener\".\nCertain parts of the promo video for \"Inbetweener\" parodied the grocery store-set ITV game show Supermarket Sweep and featured the programme's presenter Dale Winton. Prior to the release of \"Inbetweener\" Sleeper had been the opening band for Blur on their tour to promote the Parklife album, and they became closely associated with Britpop as a result.\nSleeper recorded three studio albums for Indolent and BMG/RCA: Smart, The It Girl and Pleased to Meet You.\nSmart was one of the first Britpop albums to hit the charts and won the band a BPI gold disc for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was followed by the platinum-selling release The It Girl which was arguably the band's finest moment and included \"What Do I Do Now?\", \"Lie Detector\", \"Sale of the Century\" and \"Statuesque\" as the defining tracks.\nSleeper recorded a cover of the Blondie song \"Atomic\", which was used in the film Trainspotting, after Blondie refused to allow the use of the original version. Their track \"Statuesque\" also features in the movie during one of the bar scenes.\nThe It Girl, like the band's subsequent release Pleased to Meet You, was produced by Stephen Street who was then famous for his contributions to The Smiths, Morrissey and Blur, and is since renowned for his work with Kaiser Chiefs and others.\nLouise Wener was arguably, along with Elastica's Justine Frischmann, Britpop's biggest female star. She was even something of a sex symbol, placing highly in Melody Maker's and NME's \"Sexiest Woman\" polls two years running. Wener enjoyed significant media coverage, including an NME front cover and a slot as guest presenter of Top of the Pops. Her song \"What Do I Do Now?\" was covered by Elvis Costello in 1997.\nAfter the band split in 1998 following the demise of Britpop, Wener went on to have a career as a novelist. She released her fourth book for Hodder & Stoughton in 2008. Wener also features prominently as an interviewee in John Dower's feature film documentary on Britpop, Live Forever (2003).\nA greatest hits compilation, with tracklisting and artwork by the band themselves, was released on Sony/BMG in 2007.\nTheir first two albums were reissued as deluxe versions on 29 November 2010, with second discs of B-Sides and live tracks.",

      "bio_content": "There are five artists with this name:\n1. A popular British alternative band active from 1993 to 1998\n2. An active dubstep/techno producer from Coventry, England\n3. An experimental hip-hop musician\n4. A garage rock band from Oklahoma formed in 2008.\n5. 90s emo / post hardcore band from Staten Island, NY. Later changed their name to Serpico after getting paid off by the English band.\n\n1. Sleeper was a Britpop group which formed in 1993 in Manchester, England. The band consisted of Louise Wener (vocals, guitar), Jon Stewart (guitar), Diid Osman (bass) and Andy Maclure (drums). The band released three albums -  Smart, The It Girl and Pleased to Meet You - and split in 1998.\n\nTheir breakthrough song, Inbetweener, featured a memorable video with Dale Winton, who was a popular icon among students at the time.  Sleeper also recorded a cover version of the Blondie song Atomic, which was used as a track in the film Trainspotting. Their version was quite well-received and the only criticism is that it was too similar to the original.\n\nThe It Girl was arguably their finest moment with Lie Detector, Sale of the Century and Statuesque as the defining tracks. It was produced by Stephen Street then famous for his contributions to The Smiths, Morrissey and Blur. It captured the imagination of the Britpop era. Wener admits that they were basically hanging onto the coattails of the bigger bands including the likes of Blur and Oasis.\n\nThe original band name for the band was Surrender Dorothy. They took that name from the smoke trail telling Dorothy to surrender in the Wizard of Oz movie. \nAfter the band's split Louise Wener went on to have a successful career as a novelist.\n\nThe band was the inspiration for the phrase \"Sleeperbloke\", referring to the disparity between the glamorous singer Wener and the other frequently ignored members of the band (who tended to be far more anonymous and stood at the back). The term is still used by music press journalists and musicians, to refer to any person of limited standing within a band or an especially drab and unremarkable individual. Sleeper were said to be amused by the term and even produced an ironic \"Sleeperbloke\" T-shirt which sold well\n\nThe real-life Sleeperblokes were:\n\nJon Stewart (born Jonathan David Stewart, 12 September 1967 in Sheffield) — (guitarist) \nDiid Osman (b. Kenadiid Osman, 10 April 1968 in Woking) — (bassist) \nAndy McClure (b. 4 July 1970 in Liverpool) — (drummer) \nDiscography\nAlbums\nSmart - Feb 1995, #5 \nThe It Girl - May 1996, #5 \nPleased To Meet You - Oct 1997, #7 \nSingles\nSwallow- Jan 1994 \nDelicious- May 1994 \nInbetweener - Jan 1995, #16 (UK Chart) \nVegas - Apr 1995, #33 \nWhat Do I Do Now - Oct 1995, #14 \nSale Of The Century - May 1996, #10 \nNice Guy Eddie - Jul 1996, #10 \nStatuesque - Oct 1996, #17 \nShe's A Good Girl - Oct 1997, #28 \nRomeo Me - Dec 1997, #39 \n\n2. Electronic music producer from Coventry specializing in darker styles of dubstep (\"Mass Transference EP\" Pt 1/2), and techno (\"Enter\" EP). Minimalist yet detailed razor sharp bass music.   Often collaborates with District.\nwww.facebook.com/pages/Sleeper/113978267823\nsleepermadethesethings.blogspot.com\nsoundcloud.com/sleepermusic\n\n3. \"Sleeper is a auteur of claustrophobic, sample-based hip-hop production. His work, both as an accomplished musician, and as a respected tattoo and visual artist balances a breadth of spirit with worldly, emotional depth. Finding influence and community in the worlds of classic hip-hop and artistic, experimental rock, Sleeper fills his tracks with sound, leaving an MC with just enough room to create or with the luxury of saying more by saying less. His music is lo-fi with purpose: grainy sounds are used to lend atmosphere to larger, modern electronic sound collages, grimy drums sound out familiar hip-hop patterns beneath thick layers of sound. Sleeper is a craftsman in the truest sense of the word.\"\n\n4. Sleeper is a raucous punk trio from Oklahoma, formed in the latter half of 2008. They have released a single tape to date, on their own Excitable Boy tape label.  \n\n5. Sleeper were a 90s emo/post hardcore band from Staten Island, New York. After a few releases as Sleeper, they were forced to change their name because of the existence of the UK group Sleeper, with the same name. They then changed their name to Serpico.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sleeper\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "Sleeper were a British Britpop band in the 1990s fronted by Louise Wener. The band had eight UK Top 40 hit singles and three UK Top 10 albums. Their music was also featured in the soundtrack of Trainspotting.\n\nJon Stewart met Louise Wener at Manchester University in 1987 in a political philosophy class. They played in a number of bands at university, then after graduating they moved to London and advertised for new band members in the Melody Maker (\"Bass player and drummer wanted. Influences The Pixies and The Partridge Family\") which is how they met Diid Osman and Andy Maclure.\nAt one point, the band called themselves Surrender Dorothy, after the smoke trail in the sky from the Wizard of Oz movie, but they had to ditch this idea after discovering that several other bands had done the same thing. They subsequently chose the name 'Sleeper' after the Woody Allen movie, and because it has a number of different meanings (a spy, an unexpected hit, etc.).\nAfter moving to Camden and receiving interest from record labels, Sleeper signed to BMG/RCA offshoot Indolent Records in 1993 and released three EPs and singles before their breakthrough release, \"Inbetweener\".\nCertain parts of the promo video for \"Inbetweener\" parodied the grocery store-set ITV game show Supermarket Sweep and featured the programme's presenter Dale Winton. Prior to the release of \"Inbetweener\" Sleeper had been the opening band for Blur on their tour to promote the Parklife album, and they became closely associated with Britpop as a result.\nSleeper recorded three studio albums for Indolent and BMG/RCA: Smart, The It Girl and Pleased to Meet You.\nSmart was one of the first Britpop albums to hit the charts and won the band a BPI gold disc for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was followed by the platinum-selling release The It Girl which was arguably the band's finest moment and included \"What Do I Do Now?\", \"Lie Detector\", \"Sale of the Century\" and \"Statuesque\" as the defining tracks.\nSleeper recorded a cover of the Blondie song \"Atomic\", which was used in the film Trainspotting, after Blondie refused to allow the use of the original version. Their track \"Statuesque\" also features in the movie during one of the bar scenes.\nThe It Girl, like the band's subsequent release Pleased to Meet You, was produced by Stephen Street who was then famous for his contributions to The Smiths, Morrissey and Blur, and is since renowned for his work with Kaiser Chiefs and others.\nLouise Wener was arguably, along with Elastica's Justine Frischmann, Britpop's biggest female star. She was even something of a sex symbol, placing highly in Melody Maker's and NME's \"Sexiest Woman\" polls two years running. Wener enjoyed significant media coverage, including an NME front cover and a slot as guest presenter of Top of the Pops. Her song \"What Do I Do Now?\" was covered by Elvis Costello in 1997.\nAfter the band split in 1998 following the demise of Britpop, Wener went on to have a career as a novelist. She released her fourth book for Hodder & Stoughton in 2008. Wener also features prominently as an interviewee in John Dower's feature film documentary on Britpop, Live Forever (2003).\nA greatest hits compilation, with tracklisting and artwork by the band themselves, was released on Sony/BMG in 2007.\nTheir first two albums were reissued as deluxe versions on 29 November 2010, with second discs of B-Sides and live tracks.",
