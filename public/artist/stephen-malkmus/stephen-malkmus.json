  "biography": "Stephen Malkmus was born in Santa Monica, California to Mary and Stephen Malkmus, Sr. His father was a property and casualty insurance agent. When Stephen Jr. was 8, the family moved upstate to Stockton, where he attended Carpinteria's Cate School and Lodi's Tokay High School. As a teenager, Malkmus worked various jobs, including painting house numbers on street curbs and \"flipping burgers or whatever\" at a country club. At age 16, he spent the night in jail after consuming alcohol, urinating in the bushes, and walking on the roofs of several residential homes. Later, he was placed on probation for underage drinking, and was also expelled from school \"for going to a party in the woods where people were taking mushrooms. I didn’t take them, but some guy narc’d on me.\"\nMalkmus learned the guitar by playing along to Jimi Hendrix's recording of \"Purple Haze\". During high school, he played in several Stockton-based punk bands: Bag O Bones, The Straw Dogs, and Crisis Alert. After graduation, Malkmus followed in his father's footsteps by attending the University of Virginia, where he majored in history and was a disc jockey for the college radio station WTJU. During this time, Malkmus met fellow WTJU DJs David Berman (who would later front the Silver Jews) and James McNew (of Yo La Tengo). In the late 1980s, he was employed as a security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, along with Berman and Bob Nastanovich.\nCareer\nMalkmus formed Pavement with Scott Kannberg (aka Spiral Stairs) while he was living in Stockton during the 1980s. Their first album, Slanted & Enchanted, was released to critical acclaim, and the band continued to receive attention for subsequent releases. Pavement, and Malkmus in particular, was hailed as spearheading the underground indie movement of the 1990s. In 2001, following the 1999 dissolution of the band, Malkmus released his first self-titled solo album. He also was a member of rock group Silver Jews along with poet/lyricist David Berman. In early 1999 Stephen Malkmus participated in a Sonic Youth side project called Kim's Bedroom that included bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon, guitarist/vocalist Thurston Moore, Chicago avant-garde veteran Jim O'Rourke, and renowned Japanese drummer Ikue Mori; they never released an album, but did play a few live shows. Malkmus is currently frontman of The Jicks.\nOn May 23, 2003 in Milwaukee, while touring with his new band The Jicks, Malkmus opened the show by saying, \"This is off our first record.\" The band then proceeded to play an evening's worth of Pavement songs, marking the second time Malkmus had played any of his previous band's songs since their 1999 breakup, the first was on April 22, 2002 in São Paulo, Brazil, where he played In The Mouth a Desert.\nIn 2007, Malkmus provided 3 songs to the Todd Haynes' film I'm Not There, based on the life of Bob Dylan. He contributed on the songs \"Ballad of a Thin Man\", \"Can't Leave Her Behind\" and \"Maggie's Farm\". Malkmus has admitted that he was never \"really a really big fan of Dylan,\" but noted that his involvement with the film had made him listen \"to him again a little closer.\"\nMalkmus's fourth studio album with The Jicks, Real Emotional Trash, was released in March 2008.\nPavement reunited in March 2010 and have since embarked on a world tour.\nIn August 2011 he released his fifth studio album with The Jicks, Mirror Traffic. He played the album Ege Bamyasi, originally by the band Can, in its entirety on December 1, 2012 at WEEK-END Festival in Cologne, Germany. A recording of this performance was released as a limited-edition live album on Record Store Day 2013.\nMalkmus's sixth studio album with The Jicks, Wig Out at Jagbags, was released on January 7, 2014.\nPersonal life\nFollowing the dissolution of Pavement, Malkmus moved to Portland, Oregon, where he met his wife, artist Jessica Jackson Hutchins. The couple have two children: daughters Lottie (born 2004) and Sunday (born 2007). In 2011, before the release of Mirror Traffic, Malkmus and his family moved to Berlin. By the release of Wig Out at Jagbags in 2014, however, the family had moved back to Portland.\nMalkmus is a sports fan, supports Hull City Football Club and is known to play golf and tennis; he also plays second base for the Portland-based Disjecta softball team.\n(wiki)",

      "biography_en": "Stephen Malkmus was born in Santa Monica, California to Mary and Stephen Malkmus, Sr. His father was a property and casualty insurance agent. When Stephen Jr. was 8, the family moved upstate to Stockton, where he attended Carpinteria's Cate School and Lodi's Tokay High School. As a teenager, Malkmus worked various jobs, including painting house numbers on street curbs and \"flipping burgers or whatever\" at a country club. At age 16, he spent the night in jail after consuming alcohol, urinating in the bushes, and walking on the roofs of several residential homes. Later, he was placed on probation for underage drinking, and was also expelled from school \"for going to a party in the woods where people were taking mushrooms. I didn’t take them, but some guy narc’d on me.\"\nMalkmus learned the guitar by playing along to Jimi Hendrix's recording of \"Purple Haze\". During high school, he played in several Stockton-based punk bands: Bag O Bones, The Straw Dogs, and Crisis Alert. After graduation, Malkmus followed in his father's footsteps by attending the University of Virginia, where he majored in history and was a disc jockey for the college radio station WTJU. During this time, Malkmus met fellow WTJU DJs David Berman (who would later front the Silver Jews) and James McNew (of Yo La Tengo). In the late 1980s, he was employed as a security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, along with Berman and Bob Nastanovich.\nCareer\nMalkmus formed Pavement with Scott Kannberg (aka Spiral Stairs) while he was living in Stockton during the 1980s. Their first album, Slanted & Enchanted, was released to critical acclaim, and the band continued to receive attention for subsequent releases. Pavement, and Malkmus in particular, was hailed as spearheading the underground indie movement of the 1990s. In 2001, following the 1999 dissolution of the band, Malkmus released his first self-titled solo album. He also was a member of rock group Silver Jews along with poet/lyricist David Berman. In early 1999 Stephen Malkmus participated in a Sonic Youth side project called Kim's Bedroom that included bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon, guitarist/vocalist Thurston Moore, Chicago avant-garde veteran Jim O'Rourke, and renowned Japanese drummer Ikue Mori; they never released an album, but did play a few live shows. Malkmus is currently frontman of The Jicks.\nOn May 23, 2003 in Milwaukee, while touring with his new band The Jicks, Malkmus opened the show by saying, \"This is off our first record.\" The band then proceeded to play an evening's worth of Pavement songs, marking the second time Malkmus had played any of his previous band's songs since their 1999 breakup, the first was on April 22, 2002 in São Paulo, Brazil, where he played In The Mouth a Desert.\nIn 2007, Malkmus provided 3 songs to the Todd Haynes' film I'm Not There, based on the life of Bob Dylan. He contributed on the songs \"Ballad of a Thin Man\", \"Can't Leave Her Behind\" and \"Maggie's Farm\". Malkmus has admitted that he was never \"really a really big fan of Dylan,\" but noted that his involvement with the film had made him listen \"to him again a little closer.\"\nMalkmus's fourth studio album with The Jicks, Real Emotional Trash, was released in March 2008.\nPavement reunited in March 2010 and have since embarked on a world tour.\nIn August 2011 he released his fifth studio album with The Jicks, Mirror Traffic. He played the album Ege Bamyasi, originally by the band Can, in its entirety on December 1, 2012 at WEEK-END Festival in Cologne, Germany. A recording of this performance was released as a limited-edition live album on Record Store Day 2013.\nMalkmus's sixth studio album with The Jicks, Wig Out at Jagbags, was released on January 7, 2014.\nPersonal life\nFollowing the dissolution of Pavement, Malkmus moved to Portland, Oregon, where he met his wife, artist Jessica Jackson Hutchins. The couple have two children: daughters Lottie (born 2004) and Sunday (born 2007). In 2011, before the release of Mirror Traffic, Malkmus and his family moved to Berlin. By the release of Wig Out at Jagbags in 2014, however, the family had moved back to Portland.\nMalkmus is a sports fan, supports Hull City Football Club and is known to play golf and tennis; he also plays second base for the Portland-based Disjecta softball team.\n(wiki)",

      "biography_en": "Stephen Malkmus was born in Santa Monica, California to Mary and Stephen Malkmus, Sr. His father was a property and casualty insurance agent. When Stephen Jr. was 8, the family moved upstate to Stockton, where he attended Carpinteria's Cate School and Lodi's Tokay High School. As a teenager, Malkmus worked various jobs, including painting house numbers on street curbs and \"flipping burgers or whatever\" at a country club. At age 16, he spent the night in jail after consuming alcohol, urinating in the bushes, and walking on the roofs of several residential homes. Later, he was placed on probation for underage drinking, and was also expelled from school \"for going to a party in the woods where people were taking mushrooms. I didn’t take them, but some guy narc’d on me.\"\nMalkmus learned the guitar by playing along to Jimi Hendrix's recording of \"Purple Haze\". During high school, he played in several Stockton-based punk bands: Bag O Bones, The Straw Dogs, and Crisis Alert. After graduation, Malkmus followed in his father's footsteps by attending the University of Virginia, where he majored in history and was a disc jockey for the college radio station WTJU. During this time, Malkmus met fellow WTJU DJs David Berman (who would later front the Silver Jews) and James McNew (of Yo La Tengo). In the late 1980s, he was employed as a security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, along with Berman and Bob Nastanovich.\nCareer\nMalkmus formed Pavement with Scott Kannberg (aka Spiral Stairs) while he was living in Stockton during the 1980s. Their first album, Slanted & Enchanted, was released to critical acclaim, and the band continued to receive attention for subsequent releases. Pavement, and Malkmus in particular, was hailed as spearheading the underground indie movement of the 1990s. In 2001, following the 1999 dissolution of the band, Malkmus released his first self-titled solo album. He also was a member of rock group Silver Jews along with poet/lyricist David Berman. In early 1999 Stephen Malkmus participated in a Sonic Youth side project called Kim's Bedroom that included bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon, guitarist/vocalist Thurston Moore, Chicago avant-garde veteran Jim O'Rourke, and renowned Japanese drummer Ikue Mori; they never released an album, but did play a few live shows. Malkmus is currently frontman of The Jicks.\nOn May 23, 2003 in Milwaukee, while touring with his new band The Jicks, Malkmus opened the show by saying, \"This is off our first record.\" The band then proceeded to play an evening's worth of Pavement songs, marking the second time Malkmus had played any of his previous band's songs since their 1999 breakup, the first was on April 22, 2002 in São Paulo, Brazil, where he played In The Mouth a Desert.\nIn 2007, Malkmus provided 3 songs to the Todd Haynes' film I'm Not There, based on the life of Bob Dylan. He contributed on the songs \"Ballad of a Thin Man\", \"Can't Leave Her Behind\" and \"Maggie's Farm\". Malkmus has admitted that he was never \"really a really big fan of Dylan,\" but noted that his involvement with the film had made him listen \"to him again a little closer.\"\nMalkmus's fourth studio album with The Jicks, Real Emotional Trash, was released in March 2008.\nPavement reunited in March 2010 and have since embarked on a world tour.\nIn August 2011 he released his fifth studio album with The Jicks, Mirror Traffic. He played the album Ege Bamyasi, originally by the band Can, in its entirety on December 1, 2012 at WEEK-END Festival in Cologne, Germany. A recording of this performance was released as a limited-edition live album on Record Store Day 2013.\nMalkmus's sixth studio album with The Jicks, Wig Out at Jagbags, was released on January 7, 2014.\nPersonal life\nFollowing the dissolution of Pavement, Malkmus moved to Portland, Oregon, where he met his wife, artist Jessica Jackson Hutchins. The couple have two children: daughters Lottie (born 2004) and Sunday (born 2007). In 2011, before the release of Mirror Traffic, Malkmus and his family moved to Berlin. By the release of Wig Out at Jagbags in 2014, however, the family had moved back to Portland.\nMalkmus is a sports fan, supports Hull City Football Club and is known to play golf and tennis; he also plays second base for the Portland-based Disjecta softball team.\n(wiki)",
