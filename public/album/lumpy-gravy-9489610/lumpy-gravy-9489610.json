      "biography": "Frank Vincent Zappa (born December 21, 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States – December 4, 1993 in Los Angeles, California, United States) was an American composer, guitarist, singer, bandleader and producer. He was one of the most prolific musicians of his time, releasing over fifty albums of original material spanning over a thirty-five year career.\n\nBorn on 21st December 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, Zappa’s earliest influences were 1950s pop and rock (such as doo-wop and rhythm and blues), and 20th-century classical composers including Igor Stravinsky and Edgard Varèse. His output was divided between adventurous instrumental compositions and succinct, catchy rock songs with ribald, satirical, or comically absurd lyrics. On stage he demanded virtuosity and spontaneity from his musicians, and employed many performers who would later go on to achieve fame in their own rights. He directed and released a number of films featuring himself, his musicians and entourage, including 200 Motels and Baby Snakes.\n\nHis career started in 1955. His earliest recordings date from the mid-1960s, and include collaborations with his school friend Captain Beefheart. In 1965 he joined a bar-band called The Soul Giants, quickly dominating its musical direction and rechristening it The Mothers. Their first release (as The Mothers of Invention; the name alteration requested by their record company) was the 1966 double album Freak Out!. The line-up of the Mothers gradually expanded to accommodate Zappa’s increasingly ambitious and avant-garde music, but by 1969 he decided to work outside the band structure, focusing on his solo career, and effectively disbanding the Mothers in 1971.\n\nThe beginnings of his solo career in the late sixties and early seventies was characterised by a strong free jazz influence, with albums containing little, if any, lyrical content, such as Hot Rats, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo. Towards the mid-seventies his albums became more rock-orientated, with a combination of jazz fusion instrumentation and rock song structures. This more accessible sound bore reasonable mainstream appeal, especially with the release of the well-advertised albums Over-Nite Sensation and Apostrophe (‘) (which both went Gold), but Zappa’s unpredictably eclectic output never led to solid mainstream recognition. He receieved uniformly lukewarm reviews from popular music publications such as Rolling Stone throughout his career. In his late seventies’ output, the gulf between his humorous songs and more lengthy, complex instrumental music widened, and albums, such as Zappa In New York, Joe’s Garage: Acts I, II & III, and Sleep Dirt displayed, by track, both sides firmly segregated.\n\nZappa saw a second run of success in the early eighties with the release of many albums with predominantly comedic rock songs, but later continued to experiment with virtually every style of music through the eighties, and was productive as ever until his death. His output in this later-career period included two albums of strikingly original classical music with the London Symphony Orchestra, an electronic take on 18th-century chamber music (written by the obscure Italian composer ‘Francesco Zappa’, no relation), an album of synclavier compositions (misleadingly titled Jazz From Hell which garnered a Grammy award), a double-CD release of electric guitar instrumental music (the laconically titled Guitar) and a plenitude of official live releases, revisiting fan-favourites as well as showcasing Zappa’s talent for reinventing the music of others; his version of Stairway To Heaven becoming a word-of-mouth favourite.\n\nZappa produced almost all of his own albums, spending many hours in the studio recording and manipulating tracks, and was always at the forefront of emerging technologies; from tape editing, collage, multitrack and overdubbing in the sixties to digital recording, electronic instruments and sampling in the eighties. Conversely, Zappa was also a obsessive self-archivist, recording virtually every one of his live performances, and often using live recordings of new material without needing to enter the studio. The archive of tapes at his family home in Los Angeles continues to be a source of posthumous releases for the Zappa Family Trust. He was also noted as a spotter of talent and his shifting line-up of musicians included Lowell George, Jean-Luc Ponty, Terry Bozzio, Chad Wackerman, George Duke, Mike Keneally, Adrian Belew and Steve Vai, as well as giving Alice Cooper his first break in music and working again with his old collaborator Captain Beefheart when his career was in decline.\n\nIn the late 1980s he became active in politics, campaigning against the PMRC’s music censorship scheme and acting as culture and trade representative for Czechoslovakia in 1989; and considered running as an independent candidate for president of the US.\n\nHis death in Los Angeles, California, on 4th December 1993 came three years after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.",

          "wiki": {
            "content": "Lumpy Gravy is the first solo album by Frank Zappa, originally released in 1967, but not generally available until May 1968. Zappa was credited as conductor on the album cover and he described the contents as \"a curiously inconsistent piece, which started out to be a BALLET, but probably didn't make it.\" The album consists of pieces of Zappa's orchestral music interspersed with surreal spoken dialogues and linked with many odd sound effects and musical fragments. (nb: None of the spoken dialogues or sound effects/fragments are present on the very rare 8-track cartridge release).\n\nThe title was inspired by an advertisement for Loma Linda Gravy Mix. In later years Zappa claimed Lumpy Gravy and Joe's Garage among his proudest achievements.\n\nMuch of Zappa's orchestral music was strongly influenced by his love of Igor Stravinsky ballets such as The Rite of Spring. Earlier in his career Zappa wrote music for a few independently produced Hollywood films, such as The World's Greatest Sinner (1962) and Run Home Slow, (1965). Lumpy Gravy is closely related to these early soundtrack works. The juxtaposition of highbrow and lowbrow cultural influences was a radical idea at the time. It is also a defining characteristic of Zappa's entire musical output.\n\nRecording sessions:\n\nThe album's conception came about in late 1966 when a Capitol Records producer named Nick Venet offered Zappa the chance to record an album of orchestral music. At this point in his career he was known to the public only as a rock musician. Zappa assembled approximately 40 of the best studio orchestra musicians (including legendary guitarist Tommy Tedesco) at the Capitol Records studio in Hollywood in February and March of 1967 to record an album of his instrumental compositions. Though Zappa was credited as conductor the ensemble was actually led by veteran Hollywood musician Sid Sharp under Zappa's supervision. Zappa gave the group an absurd name, the \"Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra and Chorus\", to match the music.\n\nThere was a long delay between the initial orchestral recording sessions and final release in May 1968. This was caused by a dispute between MGM Records and Capitol Records. As first prepared for Capitol, the album contained music from the studio orchestra only with a total playing time of about 22 minutes. However MGM had already signed Zappa to their Verve Records division in early 1966 as a member of The Mothers of Invention. Zappa believed his MGM/Verve contract allowed him to work on outside projects as long as he did not sing or play. MGM disagreed. It claimed ownership of the recordings and sued to stop all distribution of the Capitol album. Under terms of the settlement MGM/Verve agreed to purchase the recordings.\n\nDuring the dispute Zappa seized the opportunity to radically re-edit his work. While living in New York City during 1967 and early 1968 he worked at Apostolic Studios and Mayfair Studios, recording new music and spoken dialog for the next Mothers of Invention album We're Only in It for the Money. A series of August 1967 sessions at Apostolic included members of The Mothers of Invention and other friends in conversation under Zappa's direct supervision. Voices of the \"Chorus\" were recorded inside a piano with a sandbag placed on the pedals. This allowed the piano strings to vibrate in response, giving the spoken voices a rich and resonant quality. Bits of talk were edited into conversations about cars, drums, and pigs. One of the more interesting conversations contains Zappa's thoughts concerning his theory of \"the big note\".\n\nMany unusual new sounds were also created for the Verve version of Lumpy Gravy through the manipulation of sounds on tape recordings, a process known as Musique concrète. Using a then state of the art 12-track tape recorder, Zappa invented a unique electronic set-up which he named \"The Apostolic Blurch Injector\". He also worked from his temporary Greenwich Village home in his spare time, spending hundreds of hours manually editing recordings with a razor blade and splicing tape. Music from the original Capitol album was completely restructured and some sections were cut. Some material from the Capitol sessions, but cut from the Capitol album, were added back into the final product. Other important new musical segments were also added including a new introduction and ending. These new musical sections came from Zappa's own tape collection of studio and live performances, which was extensive even at this early stage of his career. The completely reworked Verve version of the album was extended to 31 minutes.\n\nStructure and content:\n\nLumpy Gravy uses sound effects and dialogue to link highly dissimilar musical themes. Some orchestral parts have a jazz-like feel while other sections show tonal and atonal classical music influences. On first listening, the album may appear to have no musical structure. But after repeated listening the album's unique flow begins to make more sense. Zappa's first instrument was drums. Through careful attention to rhythm, dynamics, pacing, and technology, he was able to bring sound elements together in a way that was almost without precedent. The closest parallels would be cartoon music soundtrack recordings of the 1930s-1950's, such as the work of Carl Stalling, and the music of Zappa's favorite classical composer, Edgard Varèse. Other Zappa albums such as Läther use these types of musical elements in a similar way. But the radical nature of Zappa's musical structures are at their most extreme on this album because Lumpy Gravy is composed of many short segments.\n\nDuodenum, also known as \"Lumpy Gravy Main Theme\", dates from an April 1966 recording session at TTG Studios in Hollywood. This tune was originally written as the theme for Zappa's unfinished 1964 film project Captain Beefheart vs. The Grunt People. The 'surf music' style ending of the album was recorded by a rock ensemble at Zappa's own Studio Z circa 1963. The blues harmonica fragment, \"Another Pickup\", comes from a 1966 live recording of The Mothers of Invention at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco. Sounds of bells, coughing and \"snorks\", recorded in New York City, were leftovers from an animated television commercial for Luden's cough drops. This advertisement, called \"The Big Squeeze\", won Zappa a Clio Award for sound in 1967. Though Zappa was not credited as a performer on the disc, he probably did play guitar and percussion on some of these additional recordings.\n\nThere are several thematic and musical links between Lumpy Gravy and We're Only in It for the Money. Both have extensive use of dialog, editing and musique concrète. On the back cover of Lumpy Gravy, Frank says in a speech bubble, \"Is this phase 2 of We're Only in It for the Money?\" The 'surf music' instrumental finale appears in a vocal version on We're Only in It for the Money under the title \"Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance\". One short orchestral section of Lumpy Gravy was also used in the song \"Mother People\" on We're Only in It for the Money.\n\nRelease history:\n\nThe Capitol version was released briefly in the 4-track cartridge tape format in 1967 before MGM threatened legal action. The 4-track cartridge system was an early competitor to the more successful 8-track tape format. According to Zappa himself, the Capitol 4-track of Lumpy Gravy is one of the rarest official Zappa releases - if not the rarest. Capitol had also begun preparation of the vinyl LP record as well as a 7\" single from the album (\"Sink Trap\" b/w \"Gypsy Airs\") but these did not get past the test pressing stage.\n\nThe MGM/Verve version of the album was released on LP record and 4-track cartridge in 1968 and later in an 8-track cartridge version also. This was the only Zappa project to appear on the black Verve label in the U.S. At that time Verve's black label was used only for jazz and other \"serious\" works, while Verve's pop and rock releases used a blue label. There was a mono Verve LP version, though there is still some debate among collectors about whether this is a special mono mix, or simply a reduction of the stereo with equalization and dynamic range compression applied during mastering. An alternate stereo remix of the album was prepared in 1984, with drum overdubs by Chad Wackerman, and bass overdubs by Arthur Barrow. An excerpt appeared on the sampler for the first Old Masters box set, but this remix is otherwise unreleased. The album was combined with We're Only in It for the Money for the first CD release on Ryko in 1988. This CD version most closely matches the original stereo vinyl, though the sound is of only average quality by CD standards.\n\nThe 1995 CD was reconstructed from various source tapes in an attempt to improve the sound. It was not until the 1995 CD version that \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\" were subdivided into sections with titles. Some of these new titles come from the spoken dialog, while others are names of instrumental pieces. The 1995 version features a few differences in the mix and segment segues. One section of \"Oh No\" on the 1995 CD used the mono version instead of stereo. These changes were later revealed by remastering engineer Spencer Chrislu to have occurred by mistake. The engineer expressed his regret and had hoped to fix this. However a corrected version now appears to be highly unlikely since this remastered version was approved by Frank himself.\n\nEarly versions of the album were credited to \"Francis Vincent Zappa\" on the front cover. For much of his life Frank thought he shared the legal name \"Francis\" with his father. Re-issues of the album since 1985 were changed to \"Frank Vincent Zappa\" after he saw his birth certificate for the first time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa/Lumpy+Gravy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
