      "biography": "Johnny Cash (born J.R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer, guitarist, actor, songwriter, author. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel.\n\nCash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black.\" He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,\" followed by his signature song \"Folsom Prison Blues\".\n\nMuch of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His other signature songs include \"I Walk the Line\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\", and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their wedding); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\", and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Rusty Cage\" by Soundgarden.\n\nJohnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, to Ray Cash and Carrie Cloveree (née Rivers). He was the fourth of seven children, who were in birth order: Roy, Margaret Louise, Jack, J. R., Reba, Joanne, and Tommy (who also became a successful country artist). He was primarily of English and Scottish descent. As an adult he traced his surname to 11th-century Fife, after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart. Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family.\n\nAt birth, Cash was named J. R. Cash. When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force, he was not permitted to use initials as a first name, so he changed his name to John R. Cash. In 1955, when signing with Sun Records, he started going by Johnny Cash.\n\nIn March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in Dyess, Arkansas, a New Deal colony established to give poor families a chance to work land that they had a chance to own as a result. Cash started working in cotton fields at the age of five, singing along with his family while working. The Cash farm experienced a flood during the family's time in Dyess, which led Cash later to write the song \"Five Feet High and Rising\". His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Consequently, Cash had sympathy for the poor and working class throughout his life.\n\nCash was very close to his older brother, Jack. On Saturday May 12, 1944, Jack was pulled into an unguarded table saw at his high school while cutting oak into fence posts as his job and was almost cut in two. He lingered until the following Saturday, when he died. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident; according to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny, his mother, and even Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother, but Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money at the time. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.\n\nCash's early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a high-tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone after his voice changed.\n\nIn high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother's Hymn Book. He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music, which he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.\n\nIn 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy–Drager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy. According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson's after nearly collapsing on stage in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live. The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.\n\nDuring the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002). American IV included cover songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash's plan to cover \"Hurt\", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition. The video for \"Hurt\" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.\n\nJune Carter Cash died on May 15, 2003, at the age of 73. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record, completing 60 more songs in the last four months of his life, and even performed a few surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing \"Ring of Fire\", Cash read a statement about his late wife that he had written shortly before taking the stage:\n\n\"The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She's never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart. \"\n\nCash continued to record until shortly before his death. His final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of \"Like the 309\", which appeared on American V: A Hundred Highways in 2006, and the final song he completed, \"Engine 143\", which was recorded for his son John Carter Cash for a planned Carter Family tribute album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "Though the term \"outlaw country\" wasn’t yet coined when Johnny Cash recorded <i>At Folsom Prison</i> in 1968, it's tough to imagine a more literal example. Cash’s status as a country superstar was fading by the late ’60s, but the raw excitement and immediacy of the album he made in front of a roomful of convicts at California's Folsom State Prison brought him back into the spotlight and earned him a whole new audience. Cash started his sets for years with one of his first big hits, 1955’s stark jailhouse tale \"Folsom Prison Blues\", and naturally that song kicks things off here. <br />\nCash had always shunned the trappings of stardom, and his uncompromising, black-clad, champion-of-the-underdog persona and rough-edged style helped him connect with the Folsom prisoners. With his faithful Tennessee Three offering their typically terse, barbed-wire backing, Cash sounds energised by the event. He throws himself into tough-minded stompers like \"Cocaine Blues\" and the death-row rave-up \"25 Minutes to Go\" with wild-eyed abandon, sometimes sounding nearly unhinged. <br />\nHe leans hard into prison-themed tunes like \"I Got Stripes\" and \"Greystone Chapel\" (the latter written by Folsom inmate Glen Sherley), giving them a superhuman degree of gravitas. He even finds time to lighten things up with the jokey (but still suitably gritty) \"Dirty Old Egg-Suckin' Dog\" and \"Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart\". Cash would go on to record more prison concert albums, including 1969's legendary <i>At San Quentin</i>, but before <i>Folsom</i>, nobody would have pegged a state pen as a catalyst for an iconic performance, much less a career turnaround.",

          "short": "“Outlaw country” started behind bars with this definitive live album.",
          "standard": "Though the term \"outlaw country\" wasn’t yet coined when Johnny Cash recorded <i>At Folsom Prison</i> in 1968, it's tough to imagine a more literal example. Cash’s status as a country superstar was fading by the late ’60s, but the raw excitement and immediacy of the album he made in front of a roomful of convicts at California's Folsom State Prison brought him back into the spotlight and earned him a whole new audience. Cash started his sets for years with one of his first big hits, 1955’s stark jailhouse tale \"Folsom Prison Blues\", and naturally that song kicks things off here. <br />\nCash had always shunned the trappings of stardom, and his uncompromising, black-clad, champion-of-the-underdog persona and rough-edged style helped him connect with the Folsom prisoners. With his faithful Tennessee Three offering their typically terse, barbed-wire backing, Cash sounds energised by the event. He throws himself into tough-minded stompers like \"Cocaine Blues\" and the death-row rave-up \"25 Minutes to Go\" with wild-eyed abandon, sometimes sounding nearly unhinged. <br />\nHe leans hard into prison-themed tunes like \"I Got Stripes\" and \"Greystone Chapel\" (the latter written by Folsom inmate Glen Sherley), giving them a superhuman degree of gravitas. He even finds time to lighten things up with the jokey (but still suitably gritty) \"Dirty Old Egg-Suckin' Dog\" and \"Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart\". Cash would go on to record more prison concert albums, including 1969's legendary <i>At San Quentin</i>, but before <i>Folsom</i>, nobody would have pegged a state pen as a catalyst for an iconic performance, much less a career turnaround."

            "content": "Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison represents a watershed moment in both music history and social advocacy. The live At Folsom Prison, released in 1968, not only reinvigorated Johnny Cash's career but established him as a powerful voice for prison reform and social justice. The performance demonstrated how music could transcend social barriers and bring humanity to marginalized populations.\n\nThe genesis of Cash's connection to Folsom Prison is particularly fascinating. During his service in the U.S. Air Force's Security Service division in Germany (1951-1954), Cash encountered the film Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison. This inspiration led to the creation of Folsom Prison Blues in 1953, incorporating elements from Gordon Jenkins' Crescent City Blues and drawing on noir films of the era. The song's famous line \"I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\" became one of the most memorable lyrics in country music history, capturing the raw emotional depth that would characterize Cash's career.\n\nThe historic performance on January 13, 1968, was meticulously planned. Cash arrived at Folsom having recently overcome drug addiction, making the prison setting particularly poignant. The two shows were recorded by producer Bob Johnston using a mobile unit from Columbia Records, with the morning show primarily used for the album. The performances featured Cash's touring band, the Tennessee Three, along with June Carter (whom he would marry a month later), the Statler Brothers, and Carl Perkins. The album At Folsom Prison showcases 16 carefully selected tracks, including the prison-written Greystone Chapel by inmate Glen Sherley - a decision that highlighted Cash's commitment to giving voice to the incarcerated.\n\nThe album's impact extended far beyond its commercial success. It emerged during a period of significant social upheaval in America, coinciding with the civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and growing awareness of institutional inequality. At Folsom Prison became a symbol of resistance and reform, with Cash using his platform to advocate for prisoner rights and rehabilitation programs. His subsequent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures in 1972 demonstrated how the album had transformed him from an entertainer into a serious advocate for prison reform.\n\nThe raw authenticity of the Folsom performances is evident in every track. The album captures the genuine interaction between Cash and his incarcerated audience, from the dark humor in Dirty Old Egg-Suckin' Dog to the spiritual reflection in Greystone Chapel. The Grammy-winning rendition of Folsom Prison Blues features the famous audience cheers following the \"Reno\" line, though these were actually enhanced in post-production to create the iconic moment we know today. The album's sound mix, supervised by Bob Johnston, deliberately emphasized the prisoners' reactions, creating an immersive experience that helped listeners connect with the humanity of the incarcerated audience. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/At+Folsom+Prison\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
