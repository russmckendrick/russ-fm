      "biography": "Natalie Jane Imbruglia (born 4 February 1975) is an Australian singer-songwriter and actress. The second of the four daughters of an Italian father and an Australian mother, Natalie grew up on the Central Coast, North of Sydney, Australia. As a teenager she played a role in the soap Neighbours before venturing into a singing career.\n\nHer first single, \"Torn\", reached number 2 in the UK charts and became the most played song on the radio in 1998. \"Torn\" is originally written by Anne Preven, Scott Cutler and Phil Thornalley. In 1995, \"Torn\" was recorded by Preven's and Cutler's band Ednaswap, although the band would record several more versions prior and following Imbruglia's hit recording. The first released version of \"Torn\", though, was a 1993 version by Danish singer Lis Sørensen, entitled \"Braendt\". Norwegian singer Trine Rein had a hit with an English language version of \"Torn\" in her home country, a year prior to Imbruglia's million selling single. Co-writer Phil Thornalley was involved in all of these versions and eventually offered the song to Natalie Imbruglia, whose album he produced. Imbruglia initially declined recording the song, stating she didn't want to do a cover. Ironically, \"Torn\" did not only become her biggest hit, it also became her signature song.\n\nFollowing \"Torn\", Natalie's debut album \"Left of the Middle\", released on November 1997, became a million seller. Further singles (\"Big Mistake\", \"Wishing I Was There\", and \"Smoke\"), again proved to be hits in terms of radio and video airplay, but had a less than stellar chart run compared to \"Torn\".\n\nIn a 1999 cooperation with singer Tom Jones, she appeared on his duet album \"Reload\", on which the pair teamed up for a cover of INXS' \"\"Never Tear Us Apart\". \n\nImbruglia's sophomore album, \"White Lilies Island\", was released in November 2001, although it met with significantly less success than its precursor. It did spawn the UK hit singles \"That Day\", \"Wrong Impression\" and \"Beauty On The Fire\". \n\nShe returned to acting in 2002 with a supporting role in British spy spoof Johnny English, playing alongside Rowan Atkinson. Natalie married her long-time boyfriend Daniel Johns, lead singer of Silverchair, on 31 December 2003. \n\nIn April 2005, Imbruglia released her third studio album \"Counting Down The Days\" in UK, which in its first week of sales hit number one on the album charts. The first single from this album \"Shiver\" became her longest running single on the UK charts since her debut \"Torn\" and also topped the UK Airplay charts for several weeks. The second single, the title track \"Counting Down The Days\", was released on 25 July 2005 and although it did not have as much success in the singles chart as \"Shiver\" it reignited interest in its parent album.\n\nAfter \"Counting Down the Days\", Natalie switched labels and released in a greatest hits \"Glorious: The Singles 97-07\", which included five new tracks and was promoted by the single \"Glorious\". \n\nNatalie's fourth studio album \"Come to Life\" was released on October 2009 in Europe, preceded by the music video of \"Wild About It\". The first official single issued on 28 September 2009, was \"Want\", a song written by Natalie Imbruglia, Daniel Johns (credited Kat Kourtney), Gary Clark and Chris Martin. The next single \"Scars\" was sent to radio in the UK on 22 March 2010; however, due to any support from radio networks, the single release was cancelled.\n\n\nAppearances on other albums:\n\"Troubled by the Way We Came Together\" on Go! O.S.T. (1999)\n\"Never Tear Us Apart\" with Tom Jones on Reload (1999)\n\"Identify\" on Stigmata O.S.T (1999)\n\"Cold Air\" on Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too) O.S.T.

Powering the album’s surprise success was opener—and obvious lead single—“Torn”, a fraught-love anthem about feeling pulled apart by emotions. Written by members of the American rock band Ednaswap, the song had already been recorded three times before Imbruglia took it to the top of charts in the US, Canada and several other countries. It’s easy to see why Imbruglia’s version took off, between its breezy guitar strum, baggy drums, and clean, open chorus. “Torn” became the undisputed herald for <i>Left of the Middle</i>, a contrasting set of songs designed to show off this musical newcomer’s natural versatility. \n\nA deep bench of co-writers ensures that continuing sense of variety: “Big Mistake” and “Wishing I Was There” intentionally echo the raw-throated angst of Alanis Morissette’s <i>Jagged Little Pill</i>, while “Leave Me Alone” incorporates Portishead-style flourishes like spine-tingling reverb and a jazzy, stuttered beat. Imbruglia fares quite well across all these scene changes, highlighting her vocal abilities best on ballads like the piano-led “Smoke” and the acoustic title track. \n\n<i>Left of the Middle</i> earned Imbruglia three Grammy nominations and an ARIA win for Best Pop Release. Named after the location of her adopted home in Windsor, England, her 2001 follow-up, <i>White Lilies Island</i>, didn’t have a hit with the same longevity as “Torn”, but it did confirm Imbruglia as a charming, adaptable voice in radio-friendly pop rock. She has since pivoted freely between music and acting, and she won the third series of the UK’s <i>The Masked Singer</i> in 2022. But that first-ever single of hers is still her calling card, remaining one of the most-played songs on Australian radio.",
