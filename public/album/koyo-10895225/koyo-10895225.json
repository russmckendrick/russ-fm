      "biography": "There are multiple artists with the name KOYO:\n\n1) Koyo is an American punk band formed in 2020 in Stony Brook, New York. The band was formed as a supergroup of hardcore bands including SeeYouSpaceCowboy, with vocalist Joey Chiaramonte hailing from the band Typecaste. They released their debut EP Painting Words Into Lines in March 2020. In 2022, Koyo signed a record deal with Pure Noise Records. They released a 3 song EP in July of the same year dubbed \"Call It Off\". On September 29, 2023, they will release their debut studio album 'Would You Miss It?'.\n\n2) KOYO (코요) is a South Korean singer. She debuted on September 13, 2018 with Goodbye, an OST for the drama 마성의 기쁨.\n\n3) KOYO are Huw Edwards (lead vocals, guitar), Jacob Price (sampling, synthesisers), Seb Knee-Wright (guitars), Dan Comlay (bass) and Tom Higham (drums).\n\nFormed in Leeds in 2015, KOYO have fast become a major factor in the city’s burgeoning music scene. Tagged with the prog rock label, they are in fact proficient, reflective and utterly self-effacing, a far cry from the cape-wearing and wizard-hatted indulgence of your traditional progressive musicians. True, some of their songs are longer and they are well schooled in music – literally. But KOYO wear their versatility and charm very lightly indeed.\n\nFormed by Huw Edwards and Jacob Price, KOYO are an accomplished five-piece. Blending influences as wide as Ozric Tentacles and The Velvet Underground, My Bloody Valentine and Kurt Vile, they give the impression of being able to play just about anything. KOYO combine beautiful melancholy vocals with intricate riffs and the poetry of Nick Drake. Sampling and synthesisers provide astral soundscapes, grounded by a gifted rhythm section. They are at once delicate and robust.\n\nA powerful live force, KOYO create sonic spectacles through soaring layers of sound. They fill and transform space, create darkness and colour. Songs become extended improvisations, spontaneous expressions of emotion. KOYO are an unmatchable dynamic talent.\n\nDebut single ‘Tetrachromat Pts. 1 & 2’ hypnotises and seduces, transports you to another level of consciousness. KOYO lure you heart first with their fearless emotional honesty. New single ‘Lost in the Kingdom’, released 9 th June 2017, fuses dreams and reality whilst searching for enlightenment. Their self-titled album ‘KOYO’ was released on 15th September 2017 through 88 Watt Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Koyo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
