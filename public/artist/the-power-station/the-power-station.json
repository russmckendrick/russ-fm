  "biography": "The Power Station were a pop/rock band that formed in 1984, best known for their self-titled debut album as well as being a rock 'supergroup'. The band consisted of Robert Palmer (vocals), John Taylor (bass) and Andy Taylor (guitar) of Duran Duran and Tony Thompson (drums), formerly of Chic. In 1985, the band released the Bernard Edwards' produced 'The Power Station', featuring the international hit singles \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Bang A Gong (Get It On)\".\n\nIn early 1985, the group appeared on Saturday Night Live, where they performed both of their popular singles. The band decided to capitalize on their success with a summer tour of the United States. However, Robert Palmer used this success to record a solo album, 'Riptide', which featured its own hit singles and incorporated a similar dance-ready rock style. As a result, Palmer left The Power Station and did not tour with the band. Later on, this split, with some members of Palmer's ex-group saying that Palmer took their \"sound\", led to public expressions of personal animosity.\n\nTaking in Michael Des Barres, an actor and vocalist formely with Silverhead and Detective, the Power Station underwent highly popular tours. On July 13, 1985, the group performed at Live Aid, with Michael Des Barres' singing receiving praise.  Later that year, the band appeared on an episode of Miami Vice, which was entitled \"Whatever Works\".\n\nIn 1996, the original band reformed to write and record \"Living In Fear\".  This time, it was bass player John Taylor who left the group before \"Living In Fear\" was released.  He was replaced by producer Bernard Edwards, former bass player with Chic.  The band was preparing to tour when Edwards died suddenly of pneumonia.  The band toured briefly with replacement bassists before splitting up again 1996\n\nOn September 26, 2003, Robert Palmer died of a massive heart attack.  Less than two months later, drummer Tony Thompson died of renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer). Of the original group, only John Taylor and Andy Taylor survive.  \n\nThe Power Station's music is still performed occasionally by Duran Duran. The band played \"Some Like It Hot\" on their 1987 \"Strange Behaviour Tour\" as well as while on tour in 2006.  They also performed \"Bang A Gong\" during their 1989 tour. The Power Station's music also receives considerable airplay on many classic rock oriented stations. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Power+Station\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

When Robert Palmer quit the group in mid-1985, [a407485] was recruited as the lead singer. The band folded in late 1985 as the members turned to other projects. The band reunited in 1995 with its original members. The group worked together on writing and arranging a new album, however, personal issues forced bassist John Taylor to withdraw from the project and leave the band before any recording took place. Producer [a51071] (Chic bassist) stepped in to become the Power Station's bassist and new fourth member, playing all bass parts on the album \"Living in Fear\" (1996). Bernard Edwards died of pneumonia in April, 1996 and the group disbanded permanently in 1997.",

When Robert Palmer quit the group in mid-1985, [a407485] was recruited as the lead singer. The band folded in late 1985 as the members turned to other projects. The band reunited in 1995 with its original members. The group worked together on writing and arranging a new album, however, personal issues forced bassist John Taylor to withdraw from the project and leave the band before any recording took place. Producer [a51071] (Chic bassist) stepped in to become the Power Station's bassist and new fourth member, playing all bass parts on the album \"Living in Fear\" (1996). Bernard Edwards died of pneumonia in April, 1996 and the group disbanded permanently in 1997.",

      "bio_content": "The Power Station were a pop/rock band that formed in 1984, best known for their self-titled debut album as well as being a rock 'supergroup'. The band consisted of Robert Palmer (vocals), John Taylor (bass) and Andy Taylor (guitar) of Duran Duran and Tony Thompson (drums), formerly of Chic. In 1985, the band released the Bernard Edwards' produced 'The Power Station', featuring the international hit singles \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Bang A Gong (Get It On)\".\n\nIn early 1985, the group appeared on Saturday Night Live, where they performed both of their popular singles. The band decided to capitalize on their success with a summer tour of the United States. However, Robert Palmer used this success to record a solo album, 'Riptide', which featured its own hit singles and incorporated a similar dance-ready rock style. As a result, Palmer left The Power Station and did not tour with the band. Later on, this split, with some members of Palmer's ex-group saying that Palmer took their \"sound\", led to public expressions of personal animosity.\n\nTaking in Michael Des Barres, an actor and vocalist formely with Silverhead and Detective, the Power Station underwent highly popular tours. On July 13, 1985, the group performed at Live Aid, with Michael Des Barres' singing receiving praise.  Later that year, the band appeared on an episode of Miami Vice, which was entitled \"Whatever Works\".\n\nIn 1996, the original band reformed to write and record \"Living In Fear\".  This time, it was bass player John Taylor who left the group before \"Living In Fear\" was released.  He was replaced by producer Bernard Edwards, former bass player with Chic.  The band was preparing to tour when Edwards died suddenly of pneumonia.  The band toured briefly with replacement bassists before splitting up again 1996\n\nOn September 26, 2003, Robert Palmer died of a massive heart attack.  Less than two months later, drummer Tony Thompson died of renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer). Of the original group, only John Taylor and Andy Taylor survive.  \n\nThe Power Station's music is still performed occasionally by Duran Duran. The band played \"Some Like It Hot\" on their 1987 \"Strange Behaviour Tour\" as well as while on tour in 2006.  They also performed \"Bang A Gong\" during their 1989 tour. The Power Station's music also receives considerable airplay on many classic rock oriented stations.\n\nThere are also artists named Power Station:\n\n1) Belgium electronic group made up of Dimitri Dewever and Jurgen Leyers. They have released just one single, Want You Now. The group also goes under the aliases Captain Kirk and Energy Source.\n2) Rave artist who was released music on multiple rave compilation albums.\n3) Rock artist who's only known release is on a various artist compilation released in Japan.\n4) 80s rock band from Germany, who's only known release is on a various artists compilation for local bands from the Dorsten area.\n5) A collaboration between SRVTR + Apocalypse Sounds.\n6) Rock artist who has only released one song which appears on a various artist compilation for ballads and movie hits. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Power+Station\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
