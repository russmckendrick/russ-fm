      "biography": "Soft Cell is an electronic music duo that came to prominence in the early 80s. They consist of vocalist Marc Almond and instrumentalist David Ball. The duo is most widely known for their 1981 worldwide hit version of \"Tainted Love\" and influential multi-platinum debut ''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret''. In the UK, they had five Top 5 hits, including \"Bedsitter\", \"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\", \"Torch\" and \"What!\", and also had four Top 20 albums between 1981 and 1984. The duo split in 1984, but reformed in the early 2000s to tour and released a new album in 2002. Their songs have been covered by various artists including David Gray, Marilyn Manson, Nouvelle Vague and A-ha. \n\nBoth Marc Almond and Dave Ball grew up in seaside towns (the former, Southport, and the latter, Blackpool), and later met while students at the Leeds Polytechnic Fine Arts University (now Leeds Metropolitan University). Almond, a performance artist, collaborated with Ball on a few avant-garde multi-media performances at the university. Although Ball's musical background consisted of guitar, he had access to the university studio and was experimenting with the nascent synthesizer technology at the time. The two students became the prototypical synth duo and were initially associated with other New Wave scenesters dubbed \"New Romantics\" by the British Press. Other bands associated with this scene included Visage, Duran Duran, and Spandau Ballet.\n\nMarc Almond had a productive career as a solo artist later in the 80s and 90s and with Marc & the Mambas and other collaborations. Dave Ball has done a few solo productions with other British new wave acts in the early 80s. He also later was involved in the electronic dance act The Grid with Richard Norris.\n\nAlmond and Ball's reunion as Soft Cell became official with well-received initial concerts - they performed at the opening of the Ocean nightclub in London in March 2001 to strong reviews, and a mini tour followed later in the year. The track \"God Shaped Hole\" featured on the Some Bizzare compilation titled \"I'd Rather Shout at a Returning Echo than Kid Someone's Listening\", released in 2001. The album Cruelty Without Beauty was released in late 2002, followed by a European tour and a partial US tour in early 2003. The new album featured their first new songs together in almost twenty years. One of those songs was their 2003 single \"The Night\" (UK #39). Interestingly, Soft Cell had considered recording \"The Night\" in place of \"Tainted Love\" back in 1981 as their last-ditch attempt to score a chart hit. In a 2003 interview with BBC's Top of the Pops, keyboardist David Ball asserted, \"I think history has kind of shown that we did make the right choice [in 1981].\"\n\nIn August 2007, the band announced they were working on a remix album, \"Heat - The Remixes\". The remix album is expected to be released in May 2008 and will include classic Soft Cell tracks remixed by such acts as Manhattan Clique, Cicada, Richard X, Ladytron, MHC, Mark Moore, Kinky Roland, Spektrum, George Demure, Yer Man and many more. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Soft+Cell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is the first album released by the synthpop duo Soft Cell, released in 1981 by Some Bizarre Records. The album's critical and commercial success was bolstered by the worldwide success of its single \"Tainted Love\", a cover version of a little-known R&B song by Gloria Jones which topped charts worldwide and became the best-selling British single of 1981 in the United States. The album produced two more Top-5 singles in the UK in \"Bedsitter\" and the unapologetically sentimental \"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye.\"\n\nDespite the reputation of many new wave bands as being on the cutting edge of technology, the album was created on a very low budget; it was supposedly recorded almost entirely with a Revox tape recorder, a borrowed Roland drum machine belonging to Kit Hain, a small, preset Roland bass synthesizer, and an NED Synclavier, belonging to producer Mike Thorne. The album was recorded in New York City at the height of its gay club scene, at a time which the drug MDMA (also called ecstasy) was just beginning to become popular. The sound and club beats of the album reflect this atmosphere, with songs about pornographic cinemas and infidelity, although the album's themes sprang not from New York but the seedy underworld of early Eighties London. The group caused some controversy in the UK over the single \"Sex Dwarf,\" the music video of which was banned for explicit, S&M-related content. The duo would delve deeper into its fascination with decadence on its subsequent works, including the 1982 remix album Non-stop Ecstatic Dancing, which features an alternate cut of \"Sex Dwarf\" on which singer Marc Almond, famous for his flamboyant, unabashed homosexuality, appears to simulate a female orgasm with his voice.\n\nNotably, many of their most acclaimed songs (including \"Torch\" and \"Where Did Our Love Go ?\") do not appear on their LP releases. An example of this is \"Tainted Love,\" which, when originally recorded, was almost nine minutes long because it gradually segued into \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" After it was recorded, the session was split into two different songs, with \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" only being listenable as the B-side to \"Tainted Love\" or on the full nine-minute cut, which was sold as a 12-inch single. As a result, many of their singles have become quite valuable. Their first release, the single \"A Man Can Get Lost\" b/w \"Memorabilia\" may fetch prices as high as $85 (approximately £50), because the original version was for many years unavailable on CD (although a re-recorded version appears on their 1982 release Non-stop Ecstatic Dancing under the name \"A Man Could Get Lost\").\n\nThe song \"Frustration\" also appears on the rare 1980 independently released EP, Mutant Moments, although the two versions are very different and contain slightly different lyrics. Remixes of several tracks, including \"Sex Dwarf\" and an instrumental cut of \"Chips on My Shoulder\" also appear on the remix album, Non-stop Ecstatic Dancing.\n\nIn 2008, American magazine OUT ranked Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret number 66 on their list of \"100 Greatest, Gayest Albums.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Soft+Cell/Non-Stop+Erotic+Cabaret\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is the first album released by the synthpop duo Soft Cell, released in 1981 by Some Bizarre Records. The album's critical and commercial success was bolstered by the worldwide success of its single \"Tainted Love\", a cover version of a little-known R&B song by Gloria Jones which topped charts worldwide and became the best-selling British single of 1981 in the United States. The album produced two more Top-5 singles in the UK in \"Bedsitter\" and the unapologetically sentimental \"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye.\"\n\nDespite the reputation of many new wave bands as being on the cutting edge of technology, the album was created on a very low budget; it was supposedly recorded almost entirely with a Revox tape recorder, a borrowed Roland drum machine belonging to Kit Hain, a small, preset Roland bass synthesizer, and an NED Synclavier, belonging to producer Mike Thorne. The album was recorded in New York City at the height of its gay club scene, at a time which the drug MDMA (also called ecstasy) was just beginning to become popular. The sound and club beats of the album reflect this atmosphere, with songs about pornographic cinemas and infidelity, although the album's themes sprang not from New York but the seedy underworld of early Eighties London. The group caused some controversy in the UK over the single \"Sex Dwarf,\" the music video of which was banned for explicit, S&M-related content. The duo would delve deeper into its fascination with decadence on its subsequent works, including the 1982 remix album Non-stop Ecstatic Dancing, which features an alternate cut of \"Sex Dwarf\" on which singer Marc Almond, famous for his flamboyant, unabashed homosexuality, appears to simulate a female orgasm with his voice.\n\nNotably, many of their most acclaimed songs (including \"Torch\" and \"Where Did Our Love Go ?\") do not appear on their LP releases. An example of this is \"Tainted Love,\" which, when originally recorded, was almost nine minutes long because it gradually segued into \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" After it was recorded, the session was split into two different songs, with \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" only being listenable as the B-side to \"Tainted Love\" or on the full nine-minute cut, which was sold as a 12-inch single. As a result, many of their singles have become quite valuable. Their first release, the single \"A Man Can Get Lost\" b/w \"Memorabilia\" may fetch prices as high as $85 (approximately £50), because the original version was for many years unavailable on CD (although a re-recorded version appears on their 1982 release Non-stop Ecstatic Dancing under the name \"A Man Could Get Lost\").\n\nThe song \"Frustration\" also appears on the rare 1980 independently released EP, Mutant Moments, although the two versions are very different and contain slightly different lyrics. Remixes of several tracks, including \"Sex Dwarf\" and an instrumental cut of \"Chips on My Shoulder\" also appear on the remix album, Non-stop Ecstatic Dancing.\n\nIn 2008, American magazine OUT ranked Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret number 66 on their list of \"100 Greatest, Gayest Albums.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Soft+Cell/Non-Stop+Erotic+Cabaret\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
