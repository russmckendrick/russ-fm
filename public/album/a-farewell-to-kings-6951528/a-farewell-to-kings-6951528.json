      "biography": "Rush is a Canadian rock band formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal on their first album, then encompassing hard rock, progressive rock, and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. They have been cited as an influence by various musical artists, including Metallica, Primus, and The Smashing Pumpkins,as well as progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater and Symphony X.\n\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush's sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\nThe band finished the second leg of the Time Machine Tour in July 2011 and released their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels in June 2012 with a supporting tour in the fall.",

            "content": "A Farewell to Kings is the fifth studio album by Canadian progressive rock band Rush, released in 1977. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales and mixed at Advision Studios in London.\n\nA Farewell to Kings would become Rush's first US Gold selling album going Gold in almost two months of its release and eventually Platinum.\n\nGeddy Lee played his bass lines on acoustic bass while writing them and came up with guitar lines also. The birds heard on \"A Farewell to Kings\" & \"Xanadu\" were recorded outside near Rockfield Studios.\n\n\n Track listing\nAll songs music written by Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee with lyrics by Neil Peart, except where noted.\n\n\"A Farewell to Kings\" (Music: Lee, Lifeson, Peart) – 5:51 \n\"Xanadu\" – 11:08 \n\"Closer to the Heart\" (Lyrics: Peart, Peter Talbot) – 2:53 \n\"Cinderella Man\" (Lyrics: Lee) – 4:21 \n\"Madrigal\" – 2:35 \n\"Cygnus X-1\" (Music: Lee, Lifeson, Peart) – 10:25 \n\n Song information\n\n A Farewell to Kings\nThe name of the album itself is clearly derivative of Ernest Hemingway's classic novel A Farewell to Arms. It often deals lyrically with the theme of departure, and through departure, a sort of ascension to a state of better being; this can be said to echo the evolution of society from the days of medieval feudalism and autocratic monarchy, hence \"a farewell to kings\".\n\n Xanadu\nThe lyrics for the epic \"Xanadu\" were inspired by the 56-line poem Kubla Khan, written about 1797 by British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Lee, Lifeson and Peart worked overtime on this track, each utilizing a number of instruments to effect the performance. \"Xanadu\" also marks a rare occurrence of Geddy Lee on rhythm guitar (live). Other tracks with Lee on guitar include \"A Passage to Bangkok\" and \"Resist\" (live).\n\n\nCloser to the Heart\n\"Closer to the Heart\" is one of Rush's most popular songs, seeing a fair bit of radio airplay during a time when the band was in the middle of its 'epic song' days. After a couple of near-misses earlier in the decade with \"Fly By Night\" and \"Bastille Day\", \"Closer to the Heart\" finally landed them their first hit single in the United Kingdom, reaching #36 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1978. The acoustic guitar intro was written by Geddy Lee. Peter Talbot, a friend of the band (who is also mentioned in the credits for All the World's a Stage) wrote the first four lines and Neil Peart wrote the remainder of the lyrics. The song has been part of the set list on nearly every tour since 1977. The band dropped \"Closer To The Heart\" for the bulk of their recent tours in support of Vapor Trails and their 30th Anniversary because, according to Peart, \"we got sick of it.\"\n\n\nCygnus X-1\nThe final track is another epic about a fictional space voyage to \"Cygnus X-1\". Inspiration for the story within the song was found in the observation of an X-ray source in the constellation Cygnus. Considered to be one of the most likely black hole candidates in the universe, Cygnus X-1 was discovered in the early 1970s by Canadian scientist Tom Bolton, using the facilities of the David Dunlap Observatory at the University of Toronto. The theme of the track would be continued in \"Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres\", the lead and title track of Rush's next album, Hemispheres.\n\nLike \"The Necromancer\", and the end of \"2112\", \"Cygnus X-1\" has an added synthesized voice at the beginning of the song.\n\n\nOther Tracks\nThe lyrics of \"Cinderella Man\" are based on the Frank Capra film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.\n\n\"Madrigal\" is perhaps one of the band's softest songs of this time period. It is also one of Rush's shortest songs at 2:35. The only other Rush songs that are shorter are \"Need Some Love\" (2:19), \"Malignant Narcissism\" (2:17), and \"Hope\" (2:02).\n\n\nPersonnel\nGeddy Lee - bass guitar, twelve string guitar, Mini-Moog and bass pedal synthesizers, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - electric, acoustic and classical guitars, bass pedal synthesizer \nNeil Peart - drums, cymbals, cowbells, orchestra bells, wind chimes, triangle, bell tree, vibra-slap, tubular bells, temple blocks \nTerry Brown - engineer \nPat Moran - engineer \nHugh Syme - art direction and graphics \nYosh Inouye - cover photography \nRoger Stowell - sleeve photograph \nFin Costello - liner photographs \nGeorge Graves - mastering on original album \nBob Ludwig - remastering \nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1977 Billboard's Pop Albums 33 \n\n\nSingles\nCover Information \n \"Closer to the Heart\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart & Peter Talbot \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: #76 US Hot 100 \n \n \"Cinderella Man\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee & Alex Lifeson \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \nRemaster Details\nA remaster was issued in 1997.\n\nThe tray has a picture of star with man painting with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left. All remasters from Rush through to Permanent Waves are like this. This is just like the cover art of Retrospective I. \nThe remaster has all of the original vinyl packaging including the back cover(all black with puppet strings) and inner sleeve photos of the band on stage and star with man logo reinstated(which were missing on the original CD issue).  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/A+Farewell+to+Kings\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
