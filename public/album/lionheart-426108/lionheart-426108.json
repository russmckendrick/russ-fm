      "biography": "Catherine Bush, professionally known as Kate Bush, is an English singer, songwriter, musician, dancer and record producer. In 1978, aged 19, she topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single \"Wuthering Heights\", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a self-written song. Bush has since released 25 UK Top 40 singles, including the Top 10 hits \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\", \"Babooshka\", \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\", \"Don't Give Up\" (a duet with Peter Gabriel) and \"King of the Mountain\". All 10 of her studio albums reached the UK Top 10, including the UK number one albums Never for Ever (1980), Hounds of Love (1985) and the compilation The Whole Story (1986). She was the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist to enter the album chart at number one.\n\nBush began writing songs at 11. She was signed to EMI Records after Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour helped produce a demo tape. Her debut album, The Kick Inside, was released in 1978. Bush slowly gained artistic independence in album production and has produced all her studio albums since The Dreaming (1982). She took a hiatus between her seventh and eighth albums, The Red Shoes (1993) and Aerial (2005). Bush drew attention again in 2014 with her concert residency Before the Dawn, her first show since 1979's The Tour of Life.\n\nThe TV series \"Stranger Things\" used Bush's \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\" in Season 4.  As a result of the resurgence of interest, in 2022 the song reached #1 on the UK charts, 37 years after its initial release, and generated 100s of millions of streams.\n\nBush's eclectic and experimental musical style, unconventional lyrics, performances, and literary themes have influenced a diverse range of artists. She has been nominated for 13 British Phonographic Industry accolades, winning for Best British Female Artist in 1987, and has been nominated for three Grammy Awards. In 2002, Bush was recognized with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Bush was appointed a CBE in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music. She was nominated three times for induction in the 2018, 2021, and 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As might be expected with the compressed timeline, <i>Lionheart</i> found Bush dipping into her existing stash of songs and giving them a fresh look.\n\nOn the surface, that equalled a more adventurous album interested in prioritising atmosphere and intricate wordplay than pop hooks—as exemplified by winsome piano balladry like “In Search of Peter Pan” and “Oh England My Lionheart”, or the fully orchestrated grandeur of glammy standout “Hammer Horror”. Even the UK Top 20 single “Wow”, a sprawling space-rock song Bush wrote in the style of Pink Floyd, isn’t an obvious chart tune.\n\nTo make this vision come to life, Bush was joined by several of the session players from her first record, along with other musicians—notably bassist Del Palmer, a member of Bush’s pre-solo career group the KT Bush Band, who would become a go-to studio collaborator. Francis Monkman, founder of the prog band Curved Air, also contributed harpsichord to several songs, including the theatrical rock number “Don’t Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake.”\n\nBush did pen three new songs for <i>Lionheart</i>, led by the kick-off track “Symphony in Blue”, a low-key number distinguished by jazzy piano and understated guitar work, as well as the jaunty, theatrical cabaret number “Coffee Homeground”.
