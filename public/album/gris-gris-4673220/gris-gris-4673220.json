      "biography": "Dr. John (born Malcolm John Rebennack on 20 November 1941; died 6 June 2019) was an American singer, pianist, guitarist, and songwriter whose music combined blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll.  The winner of six Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011. He was variously known as Mac Rebennack, Dr. John Creaux, Dr. John, the Night Tripper.\n\nDr. John began making his own idiosyncratic music in the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (\"the lowest time of my life\"), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Dr. John, The Night Tripper. The name \"Dr. John\" came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.\n\nDr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits' \"Luv dat chicken...\" jingle, as well as the theme song (\"My Opinionation\") for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese's documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song \"Such a Night\") and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song \"New Orleans\").  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, \"Down in New Orleans\".\n\nIn January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Gris-Gris is the debut album by Dr. John, the Night Tripper.\n\nProduced by Harold Battiste, the album was released on Atco Records in 1968. The musical style of Gris-Gris is a hybrid of New Orleans rhythm and blues and psychedelic rock. \n\nDespite the New Orleans style, it was recorded in California with several native New Orleans musicians.\nGris-Gris failed to chart in the United Kingdom and the United States. It was re-issued on compact disc decades later and received much greater praise from modern critics, including being listed highly in Rolling Stone magazine's list of list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nProduction\n\nBefore recording the album, Mac Rebennack was an experienced New Orleans R&B and rock musician playing as a session musician, songwriter, and producer in New Orleans. Due to drug problems and the law, Dr.John moved to Los Angeles in 1965, joining an a group of New Orleans session musicians. Rebennack survived by playing with various pop and rock recording sessions, receiving much of this work with the help of New Orleanian arranger Harold Battiste.\n\nRebennack desired to make an album that combined the various strains of New Orleans music behind a front man named Dr. John. Dr. John was to be named after a black man named Dr. John Montaine who claimed to be an African potentate. Rebennack chose this name because his sister knew information about Montaine and that Rebennack felt a \"spiritual kinship\" with him. Rebennack originally wanted New Orleans singer Ronnie Barron to front the band as the Dr. John character, but Don Costa who managed Barron at the time advised him against it claiming it to be a bad career move. Rebennack took on the Dr. John stage name himself.\n\nGris-Gris was recorded in Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, California. With an album due and no singer prepared, Dr. John managed to book studio time originally reserved for Sonny & Cher.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nGris-Gris was released in 1968 on Atco Records, a sub-label of Atlantic Records. Atlantic exectuve Ahmet Ertegun was reluctant on releasing the record at first, exclaiming \"How can we market this boogaloo crap?\". Gris-Gris failed to chart in the United States and United Kingdom. Modern reception of the album has been very positive. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic gave the album five out of five stars, referring to it as \"The most exploratory and psychedelic outing of Dr. John's career\". In 1999, Tom Moon of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, with a rating of four stars out of five. In 2003, the album was ranked number 143 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John/Gris-Gris\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
