      "biography": "Duran Duran (named after a character in Roger Vadim's sci-fi classic, Barbarella) are an electronic  pop rock band that was part of the New Wave movement of the 80s and 90s. Duran Duran have sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. They achieved 30 top 40 singles in the UK Singles Chart (14 of them top 10) and 21 top 40 singles in the US Billboard Hot 100. The band have won numerous awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and a Video Visionary Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2022.\n\nCreated by Nick Rhodes (keyboards) and John Taylor (bass) in Birmingham, England in 1978, it later add took in Roger Taylor  (drums), Andy Taylor (guitar), and Simon Le Bon (lead vocals). The band has sold more than 100 million records over their more than 40 years of existence, making them one of the best-selling groups in history.\n\nTheir songs are often vivid, hook-laden pieces dance pop that have fared well on the radio, but what many remember best about Duran Duran is their iconic music videos. Though many of the videos were tongue-in-cheek, the band has never quite escaped the glamorous and decadent 'jet set' image that their early videos projected. Their flashy outfits and strident, art rock influenced music showed an immense debt to 70s English glam artists such as David Bowie and Roxy Music, yet the band grasped a sense of their own identity and became one of the keystones of the new romantic movement.\n\nTheir first singer and one of their original founding members was Stephen Duffy, and their original bassist was Simon Colley. Several drummers and guitarists were subsequently tried, as well as a handful of vocalists, after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979. The band felt that they had something special with vocalist Simon Le Bon, and the group smashed into the pop scene shortly afterwards when \"Planet Earth\", their debut single, was released on 2 February 1981.\n\n\"Planet Earth\" became an immediate hit in the band's native U.K., reaching #12 on the U.K. Singles Chart on 21 February, and it did even better in Australia, hitting #8 there. Being Duran Duran's first Top 10 hit anywhere in the world, the song showed the group's interest in international stardom. The band's eponymous debut album came out promptly afterwards in June 1981. 'Duran Duran' hit #3 on the album charts and remained in the U.K. Top 100 for 117 weeks, achieving platinum status by December 1982. The initial United States release failed to generate much interest at first, but the group was a British sensation due to their strident mix of pop rock and electronic music.\n\nMusic videos for hit singles \"Planet Earth\" and \"Careless Memories\" were filmed in December 1980. As they also experienced considerable success with \"Girls on Film\", which hit #5 on the UK Singles Chart and #11 on the Australian Singles Chart, the group firmly grasped the opportunity to make a name for themselves in musical television. As their fame grew, some fans worried that Duran Duran could have peaked too early. They headed into AIR Studios in London in early 1982 anxious to somehow top themselves.\n\nBand member John Taylor came up with the new album's title, 'Rio', as a product of his fascination with the flaunting sexuality and diverse atmosphere of Brazil. He later said, \"Rio, to me, was shorthand for the truly foreign, the exotic, a cornucopia of earthly delights, a party that would never stop.\" The band had their own plans and ambitions for promotion and reunited with director Russell Mulcahy (who was behind the video for \"Planet Earth\") to plan out the release of a full length 'video album'— eleven videos in total. Totally dedicated to on-site filming,  guitarist Andy Taylor even contracted a tropical virus and ended up hospitalized, thankfully getting better relatively quickly.\n\n'Rio' was, simply, a commercial juggernaut. The band's second studio album, originally released worldwide on 10 May 1982, reached #2 in the UK and #1 in Australia. Massively popular in the U.S., it earned a gold disc on 1 March 1983 and went platinum on 26 April 1983, eventually reaching double-platinum status. As songs such as \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Rio\" received considerable airplay, critical acclaim also grew for the release. With MTV heavily playing the band's music videos, the album is still held as one of the best new wave albums ever. In April 2013, 'Rio' was even voted #3 in BBC Radio 2's 'Top 100 Favourite Albums of all time' list.\n\nIn 1985, Duran Duran performed \"A View To A Kill\" for the the James Bond film of the same name. The song appeared in the movie's title sequence and was also a best-selling single in its own right. In 1987, \"Out Of My Mind\" was featured at the end credits of the drama film 'The Saint' as well.\n\nLike Depeche Mode, Duran Duran was among the earliest bands to work on their own remixes. From the very beginning, the band had a keen sense of style, and worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn & Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon growing beyond the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured New Romantic look.\n\nAlthough the group never disbanded, it went through several line-up changes over the years - American guitarist Warren Cuccurullo (formerly of Missing Persons) was also a member of the band from 1989 to 2001, and drummer Sterling Campbell was a member from 1989 to 1991. John Taylor, Roger Taylor and Andy Taylor all returned in 2001 and created a stir among music media and the band's fans. Duran Duran released the first album from the reunited line-up, Astronaut, in 2004, which was in turn followed up by many sold out shows in England, most notably Wembley Arena, where a live DVD of the tour was filmed in 2004/2005.\n\nIn October of 2006, it was announced on Duran Duran's website that Andy Taylor had left the band. The band's latest album, 'Red Carpet Massacre' was released in November 2007.  They performed the album live in New York City on Broadway at the Barrymore Theater, for what was originally scheduled as an unprecedented 10-night run. A stage hand union strike shortened the run by a few nights, but Duran Duran were able to re-schedule the shows elsewhere. They went on to tour the world, ending their successful run in December of 2008. \n\n2008 also saw the release of a new DVD that documents the making of their now-classic \"Rio\" album (called \"Classic Albums: Rio (Collector's Edition)\"), and a book called \"Would Someone Please Explain?\"- a compilation of questions from the \"Ask Katy\" area of their popular website.   \n\nDuran Duran returned at the end of 2010 with their 13th album, the digital and self-released album All You Need Is Now which debuted at number one on the iTunes charts in many countries (including the USA).  The physical version of the album will be released with bonus tracks in February 2011.  The album was produced by Mark Ronson.  \n\n2015 saw the band return with the album Paper Gods, which was led by the single \"Pressure Off\" featuring Janelle Monae and Nile Rodgers. The album was the band's first top 10 chart success in the U.S. in over 20 years, and also reached number 5 in the U.K. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Rio is an album by Duran Duran, originally released worldwide on 10 May 1982, but re-released in November 1982 in the United States. It reached #2 in the UK and #1 in Australia.\n\nThe album went gold in the US on 1 March 1983, and platinum on 26 April 1983, eventually reaching double platinum status. It peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 album chart in the US on March 12, 1983, and remained on the chart for 129 weeks.\n\nThe first song to be recorded for Rio was \"My Own Way\", written and recorded in October 1981, and released as a single in November 1981. The rest of the album was recorded in spring of 1982 at Air Studios in London, with producer and engineer Colin Thurston. \"My Own Way\" was re-recorded as well; the album version is significantly different from the single version.\n\nThe second single, \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was released in the UK on 4 May 1982. It peaked at #5 in the charts on June 26, 1982.\n\nThe Rio album was first released worldwide on 10 May 1982, and quickly shot to #2 in the UK on May 29, 1982. The image on the album's distinctive purple cover was painted by artist Patrick Nagel. The cover itself was designed by Malcolm Garrett.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Hold Back the Rain\" - written by lead singer Simon Le Bon - deal with bassist John Taylor's emerging drug problem and excessive lifestyle.\n\nThe North American version was released on Capitol's Harvest Records label, with rather poor sound quality, and didn't do well at first.\n\nThe band, however, had their own plans and ambitions for promotion. They reunited with director Russell Mulcahy (who had directed the music video for their first single, \"Planet Earth\"), and planned the release of a full length video album -- eleven videos for the best songs off of the Duran Duran and Rio albums. The band travelled to Sri Lanka and Antigua between tour dates to film the memorable videos for the singles \"Rio\", \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Save a Prayer\", as well as the lesser-known \"Lonely in Your Nightmare\" and \"Waiting for the Nightboat\" -- the latter a creepy zombiefest set on a deserted island.\n\nWhile filming the tropical videos, guitarist Andy Taylor contracted malaria and was hospitalized on his return to England. This forced the delay of Duran Duran's European tour, and the record company decided to hold the release of the third single until the band was ready to promote it again.\n\n\"Save a Prayer\" was finally released on 9 August 1982, and peaked at #2 on the UK charts on September 11, 1982.\n\nMeanwhile, the band had worked with producer David Kershenbaum to create some new dance mixes for their twelve-inch club singles. In September, Capitol collected the remixes and released them on an EP called Carnival. It included \"Rio\", \"Hold Back The Rain\", \"My Own Way\", \"Hungry Like The Wolf\", and \"New Religion\", and was released in North America, Spain, the Netherlands, Japan and Taiwan. Deejays who heard the new mixes could not get enough, and started to put the dance mixes on the air.\n\nFollowing the success of the Kershenbaum remixes, Capitol changed its marketing strategy on Duran Duran from New Romantic to dance band. Frustrated with their lack of success in the U.S., the band capitalized on the moment and pressed Capitol to allow them to issue a remixed and remastered version of the Rio album in North America. The company agreed, and brought Kershenbaum back to remix the rest of the album.\n\nOn 1 November 1982, the \"Rio\" single was released worldwide. It peaked at #9 in UK on December 11, 1982.\n\nCapitol re-released the Rio album in the U.S., with Kershenbaum's new remixes in November 1982. All tracks benefited from some minor reworking, but the significant structural differences in the songs on this second pressing (matrix #ST-1-12211-Z13-REI #1) include:\n\n        * Kershenbaum \"album version\" of \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" (later used on the American 7\" single re-release)\n        * Kershenbaum \"nite version\" of \"Hold Back the Rain\"\n        * Kershenbaum \"My Own Way\" - drastically different from the original\n        * Kershenbaum \"Lonely In Your Nightmare\"\n\nAs the album began to take off, Capitol rushed a third pressing of the Rio album into stores, identical to the second, except that the \"album version\" of \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was replaced with longer Kershenbaum \"nite version\". The third pressing (matrix #ST-1-12211-Z16 #2) is much more common than the second.\n\nThese remixed versions of \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Hold Back the Rain\" were later released on CD on the Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran compilation in 1998, and \"My Own Way\" was released in the 2003 Singles Box Set 1981-1985. However, the Kershenbaum version of \"Lonely in Your Nightmare\" is only available on the second and third pressings of this vinyl album; it has not yet been officially issued on CD.\n\nOn 3 December 1982, the Kershenbaum remix of the \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" single was released in the US, some six months after its initial UK release. The single included both the album version and the Carnival remix. It peaked at #3 in the US on March 26, 1983.\n\nPart of the continued success of the album was due to the very popular videos, in heavy rotation on MTV. The video album Duran Duran was released (on VHS, Betamax, and laserdisc) to coincide with the North American re-issue of the \"Rio\" single on 11 March 1983, four months after its original release. This single included the Kershenbaum 7\" remix of \"Rio\" and peaked at #14 in US on May 14, 1983.\n\nThe first pressing of 30,000 copies of the Japanese version of the LP (Toshiba/EMI EMS-91037) came with a colour poster. There is a notation on the OBI that mentions this. Later issues of the album have the notation on the OBI removed and contain only a lyric insert with a bio in japanese and some photos.\n\nAll official versions of the Rio album released on CD have been made from the original UK master tapes, and do not include any of the Kershenbaum remixes. This includes the release, in 2001, of a 20-year anniversary reissue, completely remastered from the original.\n\nThe packaging on a limited edition version of this release (EMI; 529 9240/Capitol; 72435-25919-0-9) included an alternate version of the famous Nagel cover painting, submitted by the artist along with the first when he completed the commission. (This image was first used for the Japanese 7\" single of \"My Own Way\".)\n\nOn April 7th, 2009, Duran Duran's official website announced that Rio will be reissued as a 2 CD Special Edition on June 29, 2009 (2009-06-29) in the UK and June 30, 2009 (2009-06-30) in the US. This edition includes the album's original UK vinyl release tracks but adds substantially more to make this a definitive edition (including several tracks that have never been released in CD form as well as previously-released material from Singles Box Set 1981–1985). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Duran+Duran/Rio\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Rio is an album by Duran Duran, originally released worldwide on 10 May 1982, but re-released in November 1982 in the United States. It reached #2 in the UK and #1 in Australia.\n\nThe album went gold in the US on 1 March 1983, and platinum on 26 April 1983, eventually reaching double platinum status. It peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 album chart in the US on March 12, 1983, and remained on the chart for 129 weeks.\n\nThe first song to be recorded for Rio was \"My Own Way\", written and recorded in October 1981, and released as a single in November 1981. The rest of the album was recorded in spring of 1982 at Air Studios in London, with producer and engineer Colin Thurston. \"My Own Way\" was re-recorded as well; the album version is significantly different from the single version.\n\nThe second single, \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was released in the UK on 4 May 1982. It peaked at #5 in the charts on June 26, 1982.\n\nThe Rio album was first released worldwide on 10 May 1982, and quickly shot to #2 in the UK on May 29, 1982. The image on the album's distinctive purple cover was painted by artist Patrick Nagel. The cover itself was designed by Malcolm Garrett.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Hold Back the Rain\" - written by lead singer Simon Le Bon - deal with bassist John Taylor's emerging drug problem and excessive lifestyle.\n\nThe North American version was released on Capitol's Harvest Records label, with rather poor sound quality, and didn't do well at first.\n\nThe band, however, had their own plans and ambitions for promotion. They reunited with director Russell Mulcahy (who had directed the music video for their first single, \"Planet Earth\"), and planned the release of a full length video album -- eleven videos for the best songs off of the Duran Duran and Rio albums. The band travelled to Sri Lanka and Antigua between tour dates to film the memorable videos for the singles \"Rio\", \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Save a Prayer\", as well as the lesser-known \"Lonely in Your Nightmare\" and \"Waiting for the Nightboat\" -- the latter a creepy zombiefest set on a deserted island.\n\nWhile filming the tropical videos, guitarist Andy Taylor contracted malaria and was hospitalized on his return to England. This forced the delay of Duran Duran's European tour, and the record company decided to hold the release of the third single until the band was ready to promote it again.\n\n\"Save a Prayer\" was finally released on 9 August 1982, and peaked at #2 on the UK charts on September 11, 1982.\n\nMeanwhile, the band had worked with producer David Kershenbaum to create some new dance mixes for their twelve-inch club singles. In September, Capitol collected the remixes and released them on an EP called Carnival. It included \"Rio\", \"Hold Back The Rain\", \"My Own Way\", \"Hungry Like The Wolf\", and \"New Religion\", and was released in North America, Spain, the Netherlands, Japan and Taiwan. Deejays who heard the new mixes could not get enough, and started to put the dance mixes on the air.\n\nFollowing the success of the Kershenbaum remixes, Capitol changed its marketing strategy on Duran Duran from New Romantic to dance band. Frustrated with their lack of success in the U.S., the band capitalized on the moment and pressed Capitol to allow them to issue a remixed and remastered version of the Rio album in North America. The company agreed, and brought Kershenbaum back to remix the rest of the album.\n\nOn 1 November 1982, the \"Rio\" single was released worldwide. It peaked at #9 in UK on December 11, 1982.\n\nCapitol re-released the Rio album in the U.S., with Kershenbaum's new remixes in November 1982. All tracks benefited from some minor reworking, but the significant structural differences in the songs on this second pressing (matrix #ST-1-12211-Z13-REI #1) include:\n\n        * Kershenbaum \"album version\" of \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" (later used on the American 7\" single re-release)\n        * Kershenbaum \"nite version\" of \"Hold Back the Rain\"\n        * Kershenbaum \"My Own Way\" - drastically different from the original\n        * Kershenbaum \"Lonely In Your Nightmare\"\n\nAs the album began to take off, Capitol rushed a third pressing of the Rio album into stores, identical to the second, except that the \"album version\" of \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" was replaced with longer Kershenbaum \"nite version\". The third pressing (matrix #ST-1-12211-Z16 #2) is much more common than the second.\n\nThese remixed versions of \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" and \"Hold Back the Rain\" were later released on CD on the Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran compilation in 1998, and \"My Own Way\" was released in the 2003 Singles Box Set 1981-1985. However, the Kershenbaum version of \"Lonely in Your Nightmare\" is only available on the second and third pressings of this vinyl album; it has not yet been officially issued on CD.\n\nOn 3 December 1982, the Kershenbaum remix of the \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" single was released in the US, some six months after its initial UK release.
