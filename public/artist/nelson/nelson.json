They had a No. 1 hit in the United States with \"(Can't Live Without Your) Love and Affection\" during the week of September 29, 1990. They are listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only family to reach number one record status in three successive generations (beginning with grandparents Ozzie and Harriet Nelson).\n\nThe band split with Geffen Records record label after 1995, but they have continued to produce and release albums independently under their label, Stone Canyon Records. However, they have yet to revisit the level of success they experienced during their 1990 debut.  http://thenelsonbrothers.com\n\n2) Nelson Moraïs http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Nelson+Morais\n\n3) Nelson (formerly known as Lord Nelson) has been a fixture on the Carribean music scene for decades.

This twenty-year old native of the Bronx, New York and one of P. Diddy’s newest signings continues the legacy of great performing artists. “He’s prolific…way beyond his years,” Mark Pitts, President of Urban Music, Zomba Music Group..\n\n6) Northern Irish trance music producer Robert Frederick Nelson, better known as Agnelli & Nelson (with Christoper James Agnew/Agnelli), who are notable for helping to define the genre of trance music since 1997. Their hits 'El Niño' and 'Everyday' have become trance classics, and they've done countless remixes, from Armin van Buuren to U2.\n\n7) Yulia Nelson (Юлия Нельсон) is a pop/jazz singer born in 1990 in Odesa, Ukraine. In 1997-2001, she was part of the children's group Altair (Альтаир), before pursuing a solo career. In 2012, she moved to Moscow, Russia, to study at the theater school GITIS. In 2016, she restarted her career as a singer. After graduating from GITIS, she joined the Stas Namin Theater where she worked for 3 seasons.
