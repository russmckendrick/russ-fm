  "biography": "Supergrass is an alternative rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 1994. The band consists of brothers Gaz (guitar and lead vocals) and Rob Coombes (keyboards), Mick Quinn (bass and backing vocals) and Danny Goffey (drums and backing vocals).\n\nIn summer 1994 they released their first single, Caught By The Fuzz backed by Strange Ones on the B side, on a small local record label called Backbeat, run by Makating bass guitarist Dave Norland who worked from his bedroom in a house in the Cowley Road area of Oxford. The song was successful and it didn't take much time before Parlophone signed them and a few months later re-released Caught By The Fuzz. The spring of 1995 saw the release of Mansize Rooster followed by Lenny followed closely by the release of their debut album I Should Coco in May. It was their only album that made an impact in the USA.\nIn 1997, they released their second album, In It For The Money which got them even more acclaim, but a slightly darker sound perplexed some of their fans. Still, it was a success, both critically and financially.\nThe third album,  Supergrass (or the X-Ray Album, as the fans like to call it) released in 1999, was similar to In it for the money  and therefore was not received as well as the former albums.\nAfter the three-year-pause, Supergrass returned with Life On Other Planets (2002), which also not successful financially, but the critics loved it. It was also the first Supergrass album  keyboardist Rob Coombes was named as an official member of the band.\nAfter the best-selling 2004 greatest hits compilation Supergrass is 10, they released Road to Rouen, their fifth album was  dropped in 2005, after some delays including drummer Danny Goffey's tabloid ordeal and the death of Gaz and Rob Coombes' mother. It was well received but it's new direction was a surprise to many fans.\nThe band recorded their sixth studio album Diamond Hoo Ha between January and November 2007 in Berlin and New York. It was released in March 2008 and although criticised as formulaic, displayed strong song writing.\n\nIn 2010 they announced they would disband and played a handful of farewell shows in June. The unfinished 7th studio album Release the Drones remains unreleased.\n\nIn 2019, Supergrass reformed to play a series of gigs. However, the band does not plan on releasing new material. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Supergrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Gaz’s older brother was an ancillary member until officially being added in 2002. \r\n\r\nWhen Mickey injured himself in 2008 the band went on a brief hiatus. Danny and Gaz performed as a duo called [a=The Hot Rats] doing cover versions of their favourite songs in their own style. Whilst Mickey was recovering Danny and Gaz also performed as [a=Diamond Hoo Ha Men], playing favourite Supergrass songs, as well as songs that would be part of their 6th album. An abandoned 7th album when the band were at loggerheads that was recorded in 2009 has never seen the light of day. \r\n\r\nAll members also went on to have solo careers under their own name or as part of other bands with Gaz and Danny collaborating on each other’s solo outputs.

        "profile": "English alternative rock band from Oxford. Existed from 1993-2010, reformed in 2019 for live touring and a box set. Two members were originally part of [A=The Jennifers]. Gaz met Mick at a Harvester pub in Oxford where they both worked part time and got together with Danny to form the band. Gaz’s older brother was an ancillary member until officially being added in 2002. \r\n\r\nWhen Mickey injured himself in 2008 the band went on a brief hiatus. Danny and Gaz performed as a duo called [a=The Hot Rats] doing cover versions of their favourite songs in their own style. Whilst Mickey was recovering Danny and Gaz also performed as [a=Diamond Hoo Ha Men], playing favourite Supergrass songs, as well as songs that would be part of their 6th album. An abandoned 7th album when the band were at loggerheads that was recorded in 2009 has never seen the light of day. \r\n\r\nAll members also went on to have solo careers under their own name or as part of other bands with Gaz and Danny collaborating on each other’s solo outputs.

      "bio_content": "Supergrass is an alternative rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 1994. The band consists of brothers Gaz (guitar and lead vocals) and Rob Coombes (keyboards), Mick Quinn (bass and backing vocals) and Danny Goffey (drums and backing vocals).\n\nIn summer 1994 they released their first single, Caught By The Fuzz backed by Strange Ones on the B side, on a small local record label called Backbeat, run by Makating bass guitarist Dave Norland who worked from his bedroom in a house in the Cowley Road area of Oxford. The song was successful and it didn't take much time before Parlophone signed them and a few months later re-released Caught By The Fuzz. The spring of 1995 saw the release of Mansize Rooster followed by Lenny followed closely by the release of their debut album I Should Coco in May. It was their only album that made an impact in the USA.\nIn 1997, they released their second album, In It For The Money which got them even more acclaim, but a slightly darker sound perplexed some of their fans. Still, it was a success, both critically and financially.\nThe third album,  Supergrass (or the X-Ray Album, as the fans like to call it) released in 1999, was similar to In it for the money  and therefore was not received as well as the former albums.\nAfter the three-year-pause, Supergrass returned with Life On Other Planets (2002), which also not successful financially, but the critics loved it. It was also the first Supergrass album  keyboardist Rob Coombes was named as an official member of the band.\nAfter the best-selling 2004 greatest hits compilation Supergrass is 10, they released Road to Rouen, their fifth album was  dropped in 2005, after some delays including drummer Danny Goffey's tabloid ordeal and the death of Gaz and Rob Coombes' mother. It was well received but it's new direction was a surprise to many fans.\nThe band recorded their sixth studio album Diamond Hoo Ha between January and November 2007 in Berlin and New York. It was released in March 2008 and although criticised as formulaic, displayed strong song writing.\n\nIn 2010 they announced they would disband and played a handful of farewell shows in June. The unfinished 7th studio album Release the Drones remains unreleased.\n\nIn 2019, Supergrass reformed to play a series of gigs. However, the band does not plan on releasing new material. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Supergrass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
