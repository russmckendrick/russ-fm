      "biography": "Bon Jovi is an American rock band from Sayreville, New Jersey. Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), guitarist Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, as well as current bassist Hugh McDonald. The band's lineup has remained mostly static during their history, the only exception being the departure of Alec John Such in 1994, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald. The band became known for writing several rock anthems and achieved widespread recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet, released in 1986. After touring and recording non-stop during the late 1980s, the band went on hiatus after the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single \"It's My Life\", which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi has been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway. Their latest album, The Circle, was released on November 10, 2009 in the United States.\nThroughout their career, the band have released eleven studio albums, three compilation albums and one live album, and have sold 130 million records worldwide. They have performed more than 2,600 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans, and were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. The band was also honored with the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004. Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.\nJon Bon Jovi began playing piano and guitar in 1975, at the age of 13, with his first band 'Raze'. At 16, Bon Jovi met David Bryan and formed a band called Atlantic City Expressway. Still in his teens, Bon Jovi played in the band \"John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones,\" playing local clubs like \"The Fast Lane,\" and opening for known acts in the area. By 1980, he formed another band, \"The Rest\", and opened up for New Jersey acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.\nBy mid-1982, out of school and working part-time at a women's shoe store, Jon Bon Jovi took a job at the Power Station Studios, a Manhattan recording facility where his cousin Tony Bongiovi was co-owner. Bon Jovi made several demos-including one produced by Billy Squier-and sent them to record companies, though failing to make an impact. His first professional recording was as lead vocals in \"R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" which was part of the Christmas in the Stars album which his cousin co-produced.\nBon Jovi visited local radio station WAPP 103.5FM \"The Apple\" in Lake Success, New York. He spoke directly to the promotion director, John Lassman, who accepted the song \"Runaway\" for inclusion on the station's compilation album of local homegrown talent. Bon Jovi was initially reluctant, but eventually gave them the song, on which Bon Jovi had used studio musicians to play on the track. The studio musicians who helped record \"Runaway\"-known as The All Star Review-were guitarist Tim Pierce, keyboardist Roy Bittan, drummer Frankie LaRocka, and bassist Hugh McDonald.",

            "content": "Keep the Faith is the fifth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on November 3, 1992 by Mercury Records. The RIAA certified it Double Platinum for two million shipments throughout the United States. The album has sold over 10 million copies worldwide to date. Keep The Faith was ranked number 21 on Kerrang magazine's list of the 100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album also featured in the Classic Rock & Metal Hammer 's The 200 Greatest Albums Of The 90's. The album was remastered and re-released in 1998, adding the Live From London performance of \"Keep the Faith\" as a bonus track.\n\nFollowing the completion of New Jersey tour, the band went on hiatus. During their time off, Jon Bon Jovi wrote the soundtrack for Young Guns II, which was released in 1990 as the Blaze of Glory album and Richie Sambora released his first solo album called Stranger In This Town. By this time, Jon Bon Jovi fired his long time manager, Doc McGhee and created Bon Jovi Management. Jon decided to take on a larger role, and more responsibilities within the band. The band quickly became a corporation with Jon at the helm.\n\nIn October 1991 the band went to a Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss plans for the future; the band's internal problems were solved and they were ready to have a go at a comeback. In January 1992 they headed to Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver. They spent six months making the album with Bob Rock producing. Keep The Faith was released in October 1992. The musical tastes had shifted in the four years between New Jersey and Keep the Faith. Despite the industry's and audience's growing affinity for Grunge rock, Bon Jovi's sound morphed itself to work in the 1990s music scene, and also their image changed. Before the band reunited in the studio, Jon Bon Jovi spent the summer of 1991 in anonymity, riding his bike in places like Arizona, experiences that inspired him to write Dry County and Bed Of Roses. He later commented \"I would never been possible to write songs like Bed of Roses or Dry County five years ago.\".\n\nA single for \"Keep the Faith\" was put out prior to the album's release with the song, \"I Wish Everyday Could Be Like Christmas\" appearing as the B-Side.\n\nKeep The Faith released in November 1992. The album managed to sell 2 million copies in United States, peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200 and spent total of 49 weeks on the chart. The album produced three Top 40 hits. \"Keep The Faith\" hit the #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, \"Bed of Roses\" hit the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \"In These Arms\" hit the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn the UK, reaction was quite impressive. Keep The Faith debuted there at #1, and spent 24 weeks inside the Top 20. Keep The Faith spent a total of 95 weeks inside the Top 200 of the UK Albums Chart. The album produced six UK Top 20 hit singles, three of which were hit the Top 10. These were \"Keep The Faith\", \"Bed Of Roses\", \"In These Arms\", \"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\", \"I Believe\" and \"Dry County\". Keep The Faith was also a huge success in Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan and sold very well in both Asia and South America, two emerging and growing record markets. To date, the album has sold 10 million copies world wide. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Jovi/Keep+The+Faith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
