      "biography": "This page is shared by multiple bands:\n1. British electronic music band The Orb\n2. Australian psychedelic rock band ORB\n\n1. The Orb are a British electronic music band known for pioneering the genre of ambient house. The Orb is heavily influenced by dub music, and much of their later output has been in the electronic dub category, more so than ambient house.\n\nThe group was formed in 1988 by Dr. Alex Paterson (full name Duncan Robert Alex Paterson) and Jimmy Cauty (one half of The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu and later The KLF). The Orb's first release was the acid house anthem \"Tripping on Sunshine\".\n\nIn May 1989, The Orb released the \"Kiss EP\", which was heavily influenced by New York's KISS FM. Paterson began DJing around London, England at this time when he met Paul Oakenfold. At Oakenfold's behest, Paterson began DJing at Land of Oz, the chill-out room at Heaven.\n\nPaterson mixed samples of BBC nature recordings, NASA space broadcasts and everything in between into the music of ambient pioneers such as Brian Eno. Around this time, Paterson met Steve Hillage and Hillage later contributed guitar to the Orb's \"Blue Room\" single. In return Paterson worked on Hillage's System 7 project.\n\nIn October 1989 The Orb released the 22-minute single \"A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld\", which contains large chunks of Minnie Riperton's \"Loving You\". The single managed to reach the lower end of the UK chart. Although Paterson and Cauty had been working on a debut album, the two split in April 1990. Cauty removed Paterson's contributions to the album and released the remainder as \"Space\".\n\nKilling Joke's Youth, who'd recently found dancefloor success with Blue Pearl assisted with the single \"Little Fluffy Clouds\", but existing commitments made it impossible for him to be anything more than a part-time member. In his place, Paterson recruited Kris Weston (aka Thrash), a young studio engineer who had worked on \"Little Fluffy Clouds\" and recently left Fortran 5.\n\nIn April, 1991, The Orb's debut album, \"Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld\" was released in the United Kingdom to critical acclaim. The double-album obtained a top 30 placing in the UK.\n\n\"U.F.Orb\" was released in July, 1992. It featured the 39 minute 59 second \"Blue Room\" which was their third single to reach the UK charts, although the album version was only 17 minutes long. Early pressings of the album were available in three differently coloured sealed plastic packs (black (10,000) and blue (5,000) in the UK and green (1,000) in the US) containing an additional disc with the soundtrack from Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld (Patterns & Textures edition), a mail order only long form video released by the Orb.\n\nDuring 1993 and 1994 The Orb were dismayed by Big Life's intention to re-issue some of the Orb's earlier material. As a result, Paterson and Thrash opted out of their contract and Paterson signed an international deal with Chris Blackwell's Island Records. The double-album \"Live '93\" soon followed. It was a mix of recordings made in Glastonbury, Copenhagen and Tokyo. The album's credits included, Simon Phillips, Nick Burton, Kris Weston, Fluff and of course Paterson.\n\nIn June, 1994, they released their first studio album for Island, \"Pomme Fritz (The Orb's Little Album)\". The album reached number six on the UK, but critics hated it, even comparing Paterson to Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett.\n\nAugust, 1994 saw the release of a collaboration between Robert Fripp, Paterson, Weston, and Thomas Fehlmann, hence the name FFWD or Fripp, Fehlmann, Weston and Duncan. Weston's input was already diminishing by this time and following the release of FFWD, he finally parted company with Paterson. He was replaced by Thomas Fehlmann.\n\n\"Orbus Terrarum\" was released in March, 1995. In February, 1997, following an ambitious world tour, they released \"Orblivion\".\n\nThe retrospective \"U.F.Off\" came in October, 1998 and was initially available in a Limited Edition double CD.\n\n\"Cydonia\", although recorded in 1999, was delayed by Island until its release in February, 2001. Several different versions of the album were leaked on the Net some time before the official release.\n\nThe 2004 released album \"Bicycles & Tricycles\" strongly departed from their earlier ambient sound, and incorporated strong hip-hop influenced rhythms, including rap on one of the tracks.\n\nIn 2005 The Orb released a new studio album, \"Okie Dokie It's The Orb On Kompakt\", which focused heavily on the microhouse and pop ambient sounds that the Kompakt label is well known for.\n\n2005 also saw the release of \"Orbsessions Volume 1\", which was an album of rarities from throughout The Orbs' career.\n\nSadly, Andy Hughes, long-time mixer and producer of many of The Orb's works, passed away on June 12 2009, following a 'short illness'.\n\n2. ORB are an Australian psychedelic rock band known for their heavy style, punctuated with fuzzed out riffs.\n\nIn 2015 they released the demo tape Womb. This was followed in 2016 with their debut album Birth on the label Flightless Records. The following year ORB released their second album Naturality.\n\nTheir third album The Space Between was released in 2018 and supported by extensive touring across Europe and the United States. The band returned in 2024 with their long anticipated fourth album Tailem Bend. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Orb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography": "David Jon Gilmour, known as David Gilmour (born 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom) is an English musician and multi-instrumentalist, who was the guitarist, lead vocalist and one of the songwriters of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd.\n\nGilmour was born in Cambridge, England. His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), was a teacher and film editor who raised her family at Grantchester Meadows, later immortalised by a Roger Waters song on Pink Floyd's Ummagumma. Gilmour and his siblings were encouraged by their parents in their musical abilities. Gilmour has a younger brother, Peter, who has been a guitarist for a slightly longer time than Gilmour. Gilmour attended The Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he \"didn't enjoy\" but where he met future Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett, along with bassist and vocalist Roger Waters who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road. In 1954, Gilmour bought his first single, Bill Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\". At age 13, Gilmour was given his first guitar, a Tatay, by his neighbour, Gilmour started learning how to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.\n\nIn September 1962, he studied modern languages to A-Level and, along with Syd Barrett, went to Cambridge Technical College. Despite not finishing the languages course, Gilmour would eventually become a fluent French speaker. Gilmour and Barrett spent their lunchtime practising guitar together, Barrett would often refer to Gilmour as \"Fred\". They were not yet bandmates, however, and Gilmour started playing in the band Jokers Wild in 1962, which Gilmour left in 1967.\n\nGilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968, when he was asked to replace former front man and guitarist Syd Barrett.  Barrett was becoming increasingly difficult to work with (due to his deteriorating mental state), so Gilmour stepped in to fill the void. Gilmour's contributions helped to define what would become known as the \"Pink Floyd\" sound. With Roger Waters, Gilmour co-wrote many of Pink Floyd's classic songs, including \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\"(Itself about Syd), \"Wish You Were Here\" (about Roger's father) , \"Time\", \"Dogs\", \"Echoes\", \"Comfortably Numb\", and \"Run Like Hell\".  When Waters left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career, Gilmour took over Pink Floyd as leader, and they released two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994).  Both albums performed very well, proving that the Pink Floyd name was stronger than any individual member.  On July 2, 2005, David Gilmour and Roger Waters briefly set aside their differences and performed as Pink Floyd for one final performance at Live 8.  The reunion was the most talked about event of the day, and sales of Pink Floyd's back catalogue shot through the roof.  Rumours of a full scale tour began to surface shortly after the show, with both Gilmour and Waters being offered millions of dollars, but it wasn't meant to be.  Neither Waters nor Gilmour showed much enthusiasm to work together again, with Gilmour being quoted as saying that he would rather spend his time pursuing his solo career.\n\nMuch to everyone's surprise, Gilmour and Waters reunited once again on July 11, 2010 for a charity performance for \"The Hoping Foundation,\" an organization that supports Palestinian refugee kids.  At Ronnie Scott's club in London, the duo performed four songs together: \"To Know Him is to Love Him\" (a cover of the old Teddy Bear's song), \"Wish You Were Here,\" \"Comfortably Numb,\" and finally (after a special request) \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2.\"  Once again, just like after the Live 8 Reunion, speculation began regarding future reunions.  No official Pink Floyd reunion has yet been set, but Gilmour did promise that he would join Roger Waters for one show on his 2010-11 \"The Wall\" tour, performing \"Comfortably Numb.\"  The show that Gilmour is set to play is being kept a secret to surprise fans and (most likely) to prevent scalpers from selling tickets at outrageous prices.\n\nThe door now seems slightly ajar that David Gilmour and Roger Waters may possibly work with each other again, either as a duo, or as Pink Floyd once again.  On Roger Waters's facebook page, he wrote: \"We (played together), and it was fucking great!  End of story.  Or possibly beginning.\"\n\nAs a solo artist, David Gilmour has released 3 studio albums; David Gilmour (1978), About Face (1984), and On an Island (2006). In September 2008, he released his first live album Live In Gdansk , a recording of a concert he and his band performed in Gdansk Shipyard during his 2006 On An Island tour. In addition, he has two live DVDs - 2002's mostly acoustic \"In Concert\" and 2007's Remember That Night. \n\nIn 2015 he released his forth studio album: Rattle That Lock followed by a live album Live at Pompeii in 2017 which was recored on 7th and 8th July 2016 at his two gigs in Pompeii. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Gilmour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
