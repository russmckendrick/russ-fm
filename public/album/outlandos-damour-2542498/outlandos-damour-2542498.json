      "biography": "The Police were an English rock band formed in London in 1977. For the majority of their history, the band consisted of Sting (lead singer, bassist and principal songwriter), Andy Summers (guitarist) and Stewart Copeland (drummer). The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and are generally regarded as one of the first new wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock that was influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. They are also considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S. They disbanded in 1986, but reunited in early 2007 for a one-off world tour that ended in August 2008.\nTheir 1978 debut album, Outlandos d'Amour, reached No. 6 in the UK, and their second album Reggatta de Blanc became the first of five consecutive UK No. 1 albums. Synchronicity from 1983 was No. 1 in both the UK and U.S., selling over 8 million copies in the U.S. alone. The Police have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, thanks to their reunion tour.\nThe band has won a number of music awards throughout their career, including six Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards—winning Best British Group once, an MTV Video Music Award, and in 2003 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their five studio albums appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The Police were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.",

      "editorial_notes": "Going by their backgrounds, The Police were one of the most unorthodox bands associated with the nascent punk era. Vocalist-bassist Sting worked as a school teacher by day and a jazz musician at night, while drummer Stewart Copeland was a tour manager and drummer for the prog band Curved Air. And guitarist Andy Summers had been kicking around the British music scene since the 1960s, with stints playing with (among others) Soft Machine and The Animals.\n\nWhen the musicians came together as The Police, they filtered these disparate influences into a lively debut album, <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i>. Fittingly, the trio made the album with another unexpected pick: engineer Nigel Gray, a medical doctor who moonlighted in music and operated the Surrey Sound Studios. Recorded on a shoestring budget over six months, <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> included the expected raucous barn burners (“Truth Hits Everybody”) alongside laid-back reggae rock (“So Lonely,” “Can’t Stand Losing You”) and quirky pub rock (“Hole In My Life”, “Born in the 50’s”).\n\nMusically, Sting’s nimble basslines meshed well with Copeland’s fluid grooves, giving <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> a crisp, no-nonsense rhythmic foundation, while Summers dug into his arsenal of experience for guitar riffs. An urgent vocalist, Sting brought depth and sincerity to these yearning songs—which also helped the tango “Roxanne” (featuring a narrator who tells his beloved she no longer has to work in a red light district) an unexpected hit. And in what would become a hallmark for The Police, the album contains a few sonic curveballs—the laugh and uneasy piano at the beginning of “Roxanne”, or a spoken-word bridge on the tensile “Be My Girl—Sally”. In the end, <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> is one of the most influential albums of the punk era—a forward-looking record that captured the excitement and energy of the burgeoning New Wave movement.",

            "content": "Outlandos d'Amour is the debut album by The Police, released in 1978. The title is a loose French translation of \"Outlaws of Love\", with the first word being a combination of the words \"outlaws\" and \"commandos\", and \"d'Amour\" meaning \"of love\".\n\nThe LP initially flopped, due to low exposure and an unfavourable reaction from the BBC to its first two singles, \"Can't Stand Losing You\" and \"Roxanne\" (about suicide and prostitution, respectively). As Sting describes:\n“ ...We had  publicity campaign with posters about how the BBC banned \"Roxanne\". The reason they had a problem with \"Can't Stand Losing You\" was because the photo on the cover of the single had Stewart standing on a block of ice with a noose around his neck, waiting for the ice to melt. \t”\n\nHowever, the band's low-budget tour of America in support of the album made people across the country aware of the band, and especially \"Roxanne\". The song received more and more airplay from radio DJs in both the United States and Great Britain through April 1979. When A&M re-released \"Roxanne\", it went to #12 on the UK charts, and \"Can't Stand Losing You\" followed, eventually hitting #2. The album itself peaked at #6.\n\nThe album starts off with \"Next To You\", a punk number with a slide guitar solo in the middle. \"So Lonely\", a song about loneliness with a reggae beat follows. \"Roxanne\", about a prostitute, was written by Sting after visiting a red-light district in Paris and is (along with \"Every Breath You Take\") one of the Police's best-known songs. It is followed by \"Hole in My Life\", another reggae-type song about loneliness, and \"Peanuts\", a Sting-Stewart Copeland collaboration with a strong punk influence. \"Can't Stand Losing You\" and \"Truth Hits Everybody\", a pair of ominous songs detailing love gone wrong, begin Side Two of the original LP. \"Born in the 50's\", which is about the experiences of Sting and Copeland's generation (Andy Summers was born in 1942), and \"Be My Girl -- Sally\", a combination of a half-finished song sung by Sting, and a short Andy Summers poem about a blowup doll (one of the rare songs with Andy on lead vocals). This leads into the album's semi-instrumental closer, \"Masoko Tanga\".\n\nPolice manager Miles Copeland III originally wanted to name the album Police Brutality. However, after hearing \"Roxanne\" and then envisioning a more romantic image for the band, he proposed Outlandos d'Amour instead. This title was derived from \"Outlaws of Love\", which was merged with the word \"commandos\" and then given an exotic-sounding French translation.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 434 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Outlandos+D%27Amour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
