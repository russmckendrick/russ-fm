      "biography": "Pet Shop Boys are an English electronic dance music duo, consisting of Neil Tennant, who provides main vocals, keyboards and occasional guitar, and Chris Lowe on keyboards.\nOne of the world's best-selling music artists, Pet Shop Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide and are listed as the most successful duo in UK music history by The Guinness Book of Records. Three-time Brit Award winners and six-time Grammy nominees, since 1986 they have achieved 42 Top 30 singles and 22 Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart, including four number ones: \"West End Girls\", \"It's a Sin\", \"Always on My Mind\" and \"Heart\".\nAt the 2009 BRIT Awards, Pet Shop Boys received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The duo's latest studio album, Yes (continuing their tradition of single word titles) was released on 23 March 2009. The band's eleventh studio album, titled Elysium is due for release in September 2012, the first single of which, titled \"Winner\", was released on 2 July 2012.\nNeil Tennant and Chris Lowe met in an electronics shop on Kings Road in Chelsea, London in August 1981. Recognising a mutual interest in dance music, they began to work on material together, first in Tennant's flat in Chelsea and from 1982, in a small studio in Camden Town. It was during those early years that several future hit songs were created, including \"It's a Sin\", \"West End Girls\", \"Rent\" and \"Jealousy\".\nStarting out, the two called themselves West End because of their love of London's West End, but later they came up with the name Pet Shop Boys, derived from friends of theirs who worked in a pet shop in Ealing. Their big break came in August 1983, when Tennant was assigned by Smash Hits to interview The Police in New York. The duo were obsessed with a stream of Hi-NRG records made by New York producer Bobby Orlando, simply known as Bobby 'O'. According to Tennant: \"I thought: well, if I've got to go and see The Police play, then I'm also going to have lunch with Bobby 'O'.\" They shared a cheeseburger and carrot cake, at a restaurant called the Apple Jack, on 19 August (two years to the day since Tennant and Lowe had met) and, after hearing a demo tape that Tennant had brought along with him, Orlando suggested making a record with the Pet Shop Boys.\nIn April 1984, the Orlando-produced \"West End Girls\" was released, becoming a club hit in Los Angeles and San Francisco. On 2 November, it was voted \"Screamer of the Week\" by listeners of Long Island, New York radio station WLIR. It was a minor dance hit in Belgium, and France, but was only available in the United Kingdom as a 12\" import.",
