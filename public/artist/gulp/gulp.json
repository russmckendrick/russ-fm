  "biography": "GULP is Guto Pryce (Super Furry Animals) and Lindsey Leven, with Gid Goundrey providing  guitar and Gwion Llewelyn (Race Horses) on drums. Fuzzed-up bass, dream-folk vocals, acoustic and electronic drums and synths...their cinematic and ethereal sound is a musical manifestation of the road trip; the landscape and events along the way, filmic scenes and melodies - from the sun-squinting, flickering saturation and lens flare of the Californian desert to the gloamin of rural Scottish and Welsh homescapes. \n\nJune 2012 saw the release of their debut single, Game Love, which received a 5* review from Artrocker magazine and pick of the week in The Guardian Guide. \n\nIn late 2012 Gulp toured the UK and Ireland supporting Django Django and also contributed to the Django's Hi Djinx! remix lp with a cover version of Hand of Man. \n\nGulp are currently working on an lp due to be completed by summer 2013. In the meantime a second single “Play” (mixed by SFA bandmate Cian Ciaran) will be released July 29th and the band will be playing gigs and festivals over the summer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gulp\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
