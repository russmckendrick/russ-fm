      "biography": "Jeffrey Scott \"Jeff\" Buckley (November 17, 1966 – May 29, 1997), raised as Scott \"Scottie\" Moorhead, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village, such as Sin-é, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labels and his father's manager Herb Cohen, he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994. Rolling Stone considers him one of the greatest singers of all time.\nOver the following two years, the band toured widely to promote the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley's second album in New York with Tom Verlaine as producer. In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, fully clothed, in the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4.\nSince his death, there have been many posthumous releases of his material, including a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk, expansions of Grace, and the Live at Sin-é EP. Chart success also came posthumously: with his cover of Leonard Cohen's song \"Hallelujah\" he attained his first No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart that December. Buckley and his work remain popular and are regularly featured in \"greatest\" lists in the music press.",

            "content": "\"Grace\" is the first and only complete studio album by Jeff Buckley, released on August 23, 1994. The album is named after the title track, \"Grace\", co-written by Buckley and Gary Lucas. While the album initially had poor sales, only peaking at #149 in the U.S., it received wide critical acclaim. It has now sold over 2 million copies worldwide. An extended version of the album (subtitled Legacy Edition) celebrating its tenth anniversary was released in 2004, and it peaked at #44 in the UK.\n\nMusicians such as Thom Yorke of Radiohead and Matthew Bellamy of Muse list Buckley among their influences, and the album has been lauded by veteran artists such as Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave, Neil Peart of Rush, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Paul McCartney, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, and Bob Dylan.\n\nBuckley's cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" remains one of his most well-known songs, and has been used extensively in many U.S. television series and films, including The West Wing, The O.C., Scrubs, One Tree Hill and The Edukators. In 2004, this version was ranked #259 on Rolling Stone's article \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\nBuckley's version of \"Corpus Christi Carol\" was based on a version by Janet Baker. A childhood friend introduced him to the song, and Buckley sang a version on the album as a way of thanking for him.\n\n\"Grace\" has been listed as a highly rated album in many popular magazines, such as Q Magazine, where readers voted \"Grace\" the 75th greatest album of all time; the same vote was taken again towards the end of 2005, this time Grace being placed at 13. In 2003, the album was ranked number 303 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2006, Mojo Magazine named Grace the #1 Modern Rock Classic of all Time. It was also rated as Australia's second favourite album on My Favourite Album, a television special done by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation aired on December 3, 2006. Grace re-entered the Top 50 album charts in Australia at number 44 for the week of the 29th of January to the 5th of February 2007, 13 years after its original release date. It is currently certified 6x Platinum in Australia. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley/Grace\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
