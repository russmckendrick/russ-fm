      "biography": "Marillion is a rock band formed in Aylesbury, England .  Their 30-year career is marked by two distinctive phases; the early years fronted by Fish which saw their greatest commercial success, and much longer period fronted by Steve Hogarth in which the band have constantly re-invented themselves so as to continue to be relevant into the 21st century.\n\nThe Fish era is often categorized as neo-progressive. They originally started as \"Silmarillion\" (from Tolkien's book) with heavy influences from classic Genesis but went on to develop their own distinctive sound. The band was formed in 1979 by Mick Pointer (drums), Steve Rothery (guitar), Doug 'Rastus' Irvine (bass), and others, soon adding vocalist Fish (real name Derek W. Dick), Diz Minitt (bass), and Brian Jelliman. By the time of their first album, 1983's Script for a Jester's Tear, the bass position had been taken over by Pete Trewavas and keyboards by Mark Kelly.\n\nThe studio albums Fugazi (1984), Misplaced Childhood (1985), and Clutching at Straws (1987), as well as the 1984 live album Real to Reel all sold respectably, and the band scored a hit single in Britain with Kayleigh in 1985.\n\nWhen Fish left the band in 1988 after four albums he was replaced by Steve Hogarth. A former member of The Europeans and some-time collaborator with The The and Julian Cope, Hogarth brought a new energy to the band. \n\nAcross a further ten albums, Hogarth – along with existing members Rothery, Kelly, Trewavas, and Mosley – have reinvigorated and constantly redefined Marillion’s sound. They forged into new musical territories with a succession of inventive, emotional albums, displaying little regard to the vagaries of hit charts or radio playlists. \n\nAfter the release of 1999’s marillion.com the band freed themselves from record company pressure once and for all by launching their own record label, the Intact imprint.\n\nThanks to their pioneering embrace of the Internet through their website http://marillion.com, Marillion have developed a unique and intimate relationship with their fans. From sponsoring entire tours of the USA to funding the recording of recent albums, Marillion’s global fan-base is unique in its affection and dedication. As a result, such passionate, wholesale support has allowed Marillion to step outside of the conventional music industry and find their own path.  \n\nIn 2001 Anoraknophobia saw Marillion take the groundbreaking step of asking fans to pre-order an album 12 months before release. An amazing 12,000 people signed up, helping to finance the recording. The band once again took pre-orders for the 2004 release Marbles, but this time the money was channelled into a campaign fund to promote its launch. The success of singles Don't Hurt Yourself and You're Gone – the latter making it all the way to number 7 – vindicated the band's independent strategy. \n\nTheir 2007 album Somewhere Else reached number 24 in the UK album chart with their most recent single Thankyou Whoever You Are hitting the UK singles chart at number 15. The band shows no signs of fading away after more than 25 years of activity.\n\nTheir 15th album, \"Happiness is the road\", was physically released in October 2008 but was originally available exclusively from the band's website. It was released with little promotion and a deluxe pre-order package was made available as with Marbles. 'Happiness is the Road' is  the second studio double album of a long career (2004's Marbles was the other). A UK and European tour followed the album's release, and the band is taking special effort to record every show in the \"Happiness on the Road\" tour, making the recordings available from the band's website. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marillion\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Misplaced Childhood is the third studio album of the neo-progressive rock band Marillion. It was released in 1985 and has been their most commercially successful album, reaching number one in the UK album charts in June 1985 and spending a total of 41 weeks on the chart, the longest chart residency of a Marillion album. \n\nThe album features the band's two most successful singles, the guitar-led \"Kayleigh\", which reached No. 2 in the UK and was a worldwide success, and the piano-led \"Lavender\", which reached No. 5. The name Kayleigh was devised by Fish to slightly obscure the name of a former girlfriend named \"Kay Lee\" (with \"Lee\" being the middle name), who the song was mostly about.\n\nMisplaced Childhood was the band's first full concept album, consisting of two contiguous pieces of music on the two sides of the vinyl. In live concerts preceding the album, Fish had originally claimed as a teaser that the next album would consist of only two tracks, 'Side One' and 'Side Two'. Then, during the Misplaced Childhood tour, Fish would announce \"Now there is time for one more track... the name of the track is 'Misplaced Childhood'\", and the band performed the entire album in sequence.\n\nThe story has thematic elements of lost love, sudden success, acceptance, and lost childhood, along with an upbeat ending. As Fish explains, he perceived the concept during a 10-hour acid trip. Several of the songs and titles contain notable autobiographical references; one example is that track 2 (\"Kayleigh\") references past girlfriends. Another example is track 5 (\"I was born with the heart of Lothian\"), which is a reference to a traditional region of Scotland - Fish himself being from Midlothian - and a reference to the Heart of Midlothian (Royal Mile) - a mosaic heart in the pavement of Edinburgh's Royal Mile.\n\nA 2-CD remastered version with additional B-sides and demos was released in 1998.\n\nSong references;\nThe album contains several references to song titles or lyrics by Marillion and other artists. These include:\n\n\"Home Thoughts from Abroad\" by Clifford T. Ward referenced in \"Kayleigh\" (\"By the way, how's your broken heart\"/\"By the way, didn't I break your heart?\") \n\"Script for a Jester's Tear\" by Marillion, referenced in \"Kayleigh\" (\"I never did write that love song\"/\"I'm still trying to write that love song\") \n\"Love, Reign O'er Me\" by The Who, referenced in \"Windswept Thumb\" (\"Rain on me\" - NB not in lyric sheet) \n\"Ashes are Burning\" by Renaissance, referenced in \"Lords of the Backstage\" (\"Ashes are burning, burning\") \n\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\" by Van der Graaf Generator, referenced in \"Lords of the Backstage\" (\"I'm so far out  I'm too far in\") \n\"Lavender Blue\", originally an English folk song dating to the 17th century. This song became very popular during the 1950s rock and roll era, when it was sung by Solomon Burke. A hit version of the song, sung by Burl Ives, was featured in the Walt Disney movie \"So Dear to My Heart\". \n\nCoverart:\nThe boy on the front cover is Robert Mead, then a ten-year-old who lived next door to the sleeve artist Mark Wilkinson. Mead also appeared in the video for \"Kayleigh\" and was portrayed on the sleeves for all three of the singles taken from the album, \"Kayleigh\", \"Lavender\" and Heart of Lothian.\n\nNotes:\nThe album was the inspiration for comedian Will Smith’s Edinburgh Fringe show “Misplaced Childhood” in 2005, which also led to a successful tour in 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marillion/Misplaced+Childhood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
