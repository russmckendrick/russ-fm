  "biography": "Katatonia is a Swedish gothic metal band formed in Stockholm in 1991 by Jonas Renkse and Anders Nyström. The band started as a studio-only project for the duo, as an outlet for the band's love of black metal/doom metal. Increasing popularity led them to add more band members for live performances, though outside of the band's founders, the lineup was a constantly changing, revolving door of musicians throughout the 1990s, notably including Mikael Åkerfeldt of the band Opeth for a period. After two gothic metal albums, Dance of December Souls (1993) and Brave Murder Day (1996), problems with Renkse's vocal cords coupled with new musical influences led the band away from harsh vocals to a sound combining elements of doom metal, alternative metal and progressive metal among their influences of post-punk and shoegaze.\n\nThe band released two more albums, Discouraged Ones (1998) and Tonight's Decision (1999), before settling into a stable quintet lineup for all of the 2000s. The band released four more albums with said lineup: Last Fair Deal Gone Down (2001), Viva Emptiness (2003), The Great Cold Distance (2006) and Night Is the New Day (2009), with the band slowly moving away from their metal sound while adding more progressive rock sounds to their work over time. While lineup changes started up again into the 2010s, Renkse and Nyström persisted, and the band continued on to release their ninth and tenth studio albums, Dead End Kings (2012) and The Fall of Hearts (2016). After touring in support of the album through 2017, the band entered a hiatus at the beginning of 2018. The band returned from their hiatus in February 2019, with their eleventh studio album, City Burials, released in April 2020 and twelfth studio album, Sky Void of Stars (2023).\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katatonia\n\nStudio albums\nDance of December Souls (1993)\nBrave Murder Day (1996)\nDiscouraged Ones (1998)\nTonight's Decision (1999)\nLast Fair Deal Gone Down (2001)\nViva Emptiness (2003)\nThe Great Cold Distance (2006)\nNight Is the New Day (2009)\nDead End Kings (2012)\nThe Fall of Hearts (2016)\nCity Burials (2020)\nSky Void of Stars (2023)\n\n----------\n\nKatatonia was a Polish death/thrash metal band.
