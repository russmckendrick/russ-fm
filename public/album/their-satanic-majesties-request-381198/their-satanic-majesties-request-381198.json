      "biography": "The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The first settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones on guitar and harmonica, Ian Stewart on piano, Mick Jagger on lead vocals and harmonica, Keith Richards on guitar and backing vocals, Bill Wyman on bass and Charlie Watts on drums. Jones founded and led the band, but Jagger and Richards assumed leadership after becoming the primary songwriters. Jones' increasing physical and mental troubles forced his departure from the band two weeks prior to his drowning death in 1969. Since Wyman retired in 1993, full band members have been Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood who joined in 1975, replacing Mick Taylor (who had followed Jones). The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Rolling Stones in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list and their album sales are estimated at more than 200 million worldwide.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the \"British Invasion\" of English bands that became popular in the U.S. in the mid-sixties. They have released twenty-four studio albums, eleven live albums and numerous compilations. Their album Sticky Fingers (1971) began a string of eight consecutive studio albums reaching number one in the United States. Their most recent album of new material, A Bigger Bang, was released in 2005. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on \"The Billboard Top All-Time Artists\" and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' advent brought greater international recognition to the primitive urban blues typified by Chess Records' artist Muddy Waters, writer of \"Rollin' Stone\", the song for which the band is named. Critic and musicologist Robert Palmer said their endurance and relevance stems from being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\" while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\". In 2012 the band celebrated their 50th anniversary.",

      "editorial_notes": "To be a Rolling Stone circa <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i> is to have stood at the convergence of cultural change in ways few can claim. Swinging London, sexual liberation, the embrace of drugs and the desecration of a life decent young men (like them) were expected not only to work for but to embrace: It all mapped. Most of the time, the band were on the leading edge—they didn’t just set trends, they transcended them. Yes, you could find them in the bigger picture, but by 1967 they were good enough to exist outside it, too. <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i> was one of the few times they responded directly to the sound of the moment—in this case, the excesses of “psychedelia”. (That term had always been a little foolish: What were “Paint It Black” and “19th Nervous Breakdown” if not three-minute explorations of the bent perceptions and spiralling anxieties of LSD?) But like The Beatles’ <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>—which had come out earlier that year—<i>Satanic Majesties</i> was bright and ostentatious, a peacock instead of a tense, circling crow.<br />\nThe album’s recording had been long and disjointed—a function, in part, of court appearances, jail time and managerial shake-ups in the wake of a drug raid the previous February. The band were rarely in the studio together at the same time, and foresight in terms of writing was limited. After falling out with Andrew Loog Oldham, they also found themselves serving as producer, a job none of them had done or seemed to want to do. Bill Wyman later described the sessions as a lottery. Jagger joked that the album was made under the influence of bail.<br />\nBut there was still gold in the hills. “Citadel” stung like a glitter whip, as physical as their mid-’60s singles albeit with the production baubles the moment demanded. “She’s a Rainbow”: the moony lyric; the sped-up, childlike voices; Nicky Hopkins’ sparkling piano—here was a rare sweet side. “2000 Light Years From Home” was requisitely spaced-out but grounded in real anxiety and longing—the alien’s lament, yes, but also the kind of thing you might write from jail, which is where Jagger had recently been.<br />\nIn hindsight, the album was an anomaly. But it also served as a kind of cleansing. Brian Jones, the band’s agent of experimentation, ebbed further into drugs and would be dead within two years. The infinite horizons of psychedelia were starting to look pretty limited. Six months later, the band released “Jumpin’ Jack Flash”—by <i>Beggars Banquet</i>, the trip was over and reality was at the door.",

            "content": "Begun just after Between the Buttons had been released, the recording of Their Satanic Majesties Request was long and sporadic, broken up by court appearances and jail terms. Starting with this release, non-compilation albums from the band would be released in uniform editions across international markets.\n\nReleased in December 1967, Their Satanic Majesties Request reached #3 in the UK and #2 in the US (easily going gold), but its commercial performance declined rapidly. It was soon viewed as a pretentious, poorly conceived attempt to outdo The Beatles and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (released June 1967), often explained by drug trials and excesses in contemporary musical fashion, although McCartney and Lennon did provide backing vocals on \"Sing This All Together.\" The album was the first, and only, album produced by the Stones themselves. The production, in particular, came in for harsh criticism from Jon Landau in the fifth edition of Rolling Stone Magazine, and the Stones turned to Jimmy Miller to produce their subsequent albums. The response of the audience and the growing rejection of the flower power scene by Jagger and Richards would mean a turning point for the Stones: in 1968 the Stones would return to the hard driving blues that earned them fame early in their career.\n\nIn 1998, a bootleg box set of eight CDs with outtakes of the Satanic sessions was released on the market. The box set shows the band developing the songs, and striking is the cooperation between Brian Jones, Keith Richards and session pianist Nicky Hopkins. Richards is leading the sessions and most songs seem to be written by him, and both Hopkins and Jones indulge in creating elaborate soundscapes, with Brian Jones' parts created on the Mellotron being especially important for the sound and atmosphere of the album.\n\nIndeed, admiration and love of the album has grown over the years as a kind of punk rockers' own ragged flipside to the Beatles more cheerful masterpieces from the same period. Songs such as \"Citadel\" have been covered by a number of young rock bands.\n\nInitial releases of the album featured a three-dimensional picture of the band on the cover by photographer Michael Cooper. When viewed in a certain way, the lenticular image shows the band members' faces turning towards each other with the exception of Jagger, whose hands appear crossed in front of him. Looking closely on its cover, one can see the faces of each of the four Beatles. Later editions replaced the glued-on 3-dimensional image with a standard photo, due to high production costs. A limited edition LP version in the 1980s re-printed the original 3D cover design. Immediately following the re-issue, the master materials for re-printing the 3D cover were intentionally destroyed.\n\nIt was the first of four Stones albums to feature a novelty cover (the others were the zipper on Sticky Fingers, the cut-out faces on Some Girls, and the stickers on Undercover).\n\nThe maze on the inside cover of the UK and US releases cannot be completed. It has a wall at about a half radius in from the lower left corner. One can never arrive at the \"It's Here\" in the centre of the maze.\n\nThe working title of the album was Cosmic Christmas. In the hidden coda titled \"Cosmic Christmas\", Wyman tells (it's slowed-down: \"We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas, and a happy New Year!\")\n\nThe album was released in South Africa as The Stones are Rolling because of the word \"Satanic\" in the title.\n\nThe Bill Wyman-composed \"In Another Land\" was released as a single, with the artist credit listed as Bill Wyman, rather than the Rolling Stones. (The B-Side, \"The Lantern\" was credited to The Rolling Stones.)\n\nThere are only two songs from the album which The Rolling Stones performed live, \"2000 Light Years from Home\" (1989 U.S. Tour and 1990 Tour of Europe), and \"She's a Rainbow\" (1997-98 Bridges to Babylon Tour).\n\nIn August 2002, Their Satanic Majesties Request was reissued in a new remastered CD, LP and DSD by ABKCO Records.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Their+Satanic+Majesties+Request\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
