  "biography": "Splashgirl is the innovative pianotrio consisting of Andreas Løwe (piano), Jo Berger Myhre (doublebass) and Andreas Knudsrød (drums). Regarded as one of the most exciting young instrumental bands to come out of Norway in the past few years. With Pressure, their third album and certainly their strongest to date, the band is taking yet another giant step forward. Here the musicians are opening the doors to several new musical rooms – to the dark, dank cellar as well as to the attic – where all their forgotten memories are stored away.\n\n\"Pressure\" was released by Hubro in Europe on August 19th 2011. The album was mixed by drone music guru Randall Dunn, known for producing the lastest Earth records.\nOrder it here: http://www.hubromusic.com/index.php?cmd=16\n\nSplashgirl has released three records. All are on iTunes, though the band recommends the physical objects.\n\nThe second album, titled \"Arbor\", was released in November 2009 on Hubro/Grappa. The music is still acoustic, quite silent and not sounding like anything else.
