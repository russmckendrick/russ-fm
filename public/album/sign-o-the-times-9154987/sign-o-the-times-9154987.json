      "biography": "Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016), more commonly known mononymously as Prince, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona; his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop.\n\nBorn and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, and was also the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career. In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar (known to fans as the \"Love Symbol\") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist.\n\nAfter signing with Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home after his death, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. He also released songs under multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made popular after being covered by other musicians, most notably \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor and \"Manic Monday\" by the Bangles. Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Released posthumously, his demo albums Piano and a Microphone 1983 (2018) and Originals (2019) both received critical acclaim.\n\nPrince sold over 100 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted twice into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)\n\nStudio albums\nFor You (1978)\nPrince (1979)\nDirty Mind (1980)\nControversy (1981)\n1999 (1982)\nPurple Rain (1984)\nAround the World in a Day (1985)\nParade (1986)\nSign o' the Times (1987)\nLovesexy (1988)\nBatman (1989)\nGraffiti Bridge (1990)\nDiamonds and Pearls (1991)\nLove Symbol (1992)\nCome (1994)\nThe Black Album (1994)\nThe Gold Experience (1995)\nChaos and Disorder (1996)\nEmancipation (1996)\nCrystal Ball (1998)\nThe Truth (1998)\nThe Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale (1999)\nRave Un2 the Joy Fantastic (1999)\nThe Rainbow Children (2001)\nOne Nite Alone...

            "content": "Sign o' the Times (often stylized as Sign \"☮︎\" the Times) is the ninth studio album by American singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Prince. It was first released as a double album on March 30, 1987, by Paisley Park Records and Warner Bros. Records. The album is the follow-up to Parade and is Prince's first album following his disbanding of the Revolution. The album's songs were largely recorded during 1986 to 1987 in sessions for releases Prince ultimately aborted: Dream Factory, the pseudonymous Camille, and finally the triple album Crystal Ball. Prince eventually compromised with label executives and shortened the length of the release to a double album, whose music encompasses a varied range of styles, including funk, soul, psychedelic pop, electro, and rock.\n\nAs with many of Prince's early 1980s albums, Sign o' the Times features extensive use of the Linn LM-1 drum machine on most songs. In addition, many songs on the album feature minimal instrumentation, and use of the Fairlight CMI, a then state-of-the-art digital sampler. Four of the album's standout songs, \"Housequake\", \"Strange Relationship\", \"U Got the Look\" with Sheena Easton, and \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" offer sped-up vocals, ostensibly the voice of \"Camille\", Prince's alter ego of the Sign o' the Times era.\n\nSign o' the Times' release was supported by several singles, among them the socially conscious \"Sign o' the Times\" and \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\"; in addition to a well-received concert film of the same name. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) four months after its release. It also reached the top 10 in Austria, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the UK and number one in Switzerland. \"Sign o' the Times\", \"U Got the Look\" and \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" were all top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. Following Prince's death in 2016, the album re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 20.\n\nThough not as commercially successful as Purple Rain, Sign o' the Times was Prince's most acclaimed record, being voted 1987's best album in the Pazz & Jop critics poll and since being ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time by several publications. It has been regarded by many critics as Prince's best album, ahead of Purple Rain. Writing for The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Michaelangelo Matos regarded it as \"the most complete example of  artistry's breadth, and arguably the finest album of the 1980s\". In 2017, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Prince/Sign+%22O%22+The+Times\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
