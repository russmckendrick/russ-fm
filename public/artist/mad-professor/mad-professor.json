  "biography": "The imaginative recordings produced by Mad Professor (born Neil Fraser 1955, Georgetown in Guyana) demonstrate a mastery of electronic gadgetry. Working from his own studios, Mad Professor has overseen more than two hundred albums including ground-breaking remixes for Massive Attack, Sade, and Pato Banton.\n\nBorn in Guyana, Fraser earned the Mad Professor tag from his childhood fascination with electronics. At the age of nine or ten he built a radio from scratch. Moving to London at the age of thirteen, Mad Professor continued to experiment with electronics. He bought a semi-professional reel-to-reel tape-recorder in 1975, but was unable to record in sync. This prompted him to purchase more and more equipment. By the following year, he had begun experimenting with dubbing.\n \nMad Professor has worked with a huge number of reggae artists both from the UK and Jamaica. These include Jah Shaka, Pato Banton, Johnny Clarke, Lee Perry and Horace Andy. His musical styles have included roots reggae, dub, and lovers rock. Mad Professor is perhaps best known for his dub albums, which include 12 installments of the Dub Me Crazy series and 5 albums under the Black Liberation Dub banner. The Ariwa website lists collaborations with The Orb, The KLF, UB40, Jamiroquai, The Beastie Boys and Rancid . He continues to release records and perform live all over the world. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mad+Professor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
