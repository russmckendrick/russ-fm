      "biography": "Noah Benjamin Lennox (born July 17, 1978 in Baltimore, Maryland) also known as Panda Bear, is an experimental musician and a founding member of Animal Collective, currently based in Lisbon, Portugal. He was a featured artist on the track \"Doin' It Right\" on Daft Punk's album Random Access Memories, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2014.\nLennox's debut album Panda Bear was released in 1999 on Soccer Star Records. After focusing more on touring and recording with Animal Collective, he released the follow-up Young Prayer in 2004 and the highly acclaimed third solo album Person Pitch in 2007. Of his songwriting style, Lennox says \"I get impatient writing songs, I can't spend more than a couple of hours before I get frustrated. So I got to kind of spit it out real fast. My favorite songs are the ones where I worked really really fast on, when it comes all out in like two hours or something.\"\n\nLennox's fourth album Tomboy was due to be released \"near the end of 2010\". He started performing material from Tomboy on December 5, 2008 at a show with No Age in Miami, FL. During a brief European tour in January 2010, he played three shows consisting almost entirely of new material. On March 7, 2010, a tour setlist with titles for ten of the new songs was posted on Panda Bear's MySpace blog. Panda Bear has also played Primavera Sound Festival in 2010. The single \"Tomboy\" and the b-side \"Slow Motion\" were released in July 2010. It was announced in August that singles \"You Can Count on Me\" and \"Alsatian Darn\" would be released via Domino on September 28. The limited 500 copies of \"You Can Count On Me\" sold out in less than a day. The single \"Last Night at the Jetty\" was released December 2010. The single \"Surfer's Hymn\" was released March 28, 2011. Panda Bear's fourth album \"Tomboy\" was released April 12, 2011 on his own label, Paw Tracks.\n\nHis song \"Comfy In Nautica\" appears in ABC's 2010 global warming movie Earth 2100\n\nLennox was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he planned to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England. However, Lennox was unable to play when the event was rescheduled to March 2012.\n\nJune 2013, Panda Bear performed a set of all new material at ATP. The new record is tentatively titled \"Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper\".",

      "editorial_notes": "In 2007, no one saw <i>Person Pitch</i> coming. The third solo album from Animal Collective member Noah Lennox—recording as Panda Bear—was an absolute revelation to anyone who’d been closely following not only his music, but the general trajectory of indie as a whole. <i>Person Pitch</i>’s bright and melancholic electronic pop sound was worlds away from his previous record, 2004’s meditative and monastic <i>Young Prayer</i>. And though the wild-eyed melodic bursts of Animal Collective’s 2004 breakout <i>Sung Tongs</i> gestured towards <i>Person Pitch</i>’s impossibly lush Brian Wilson-isms, nothing about <i>Sung Tongs</i>’ sparse structure hinted at the absolute swarm of sound Lennox would conjure on this landmark of an album. Beyond creating its own totally unique sonic world, <i>Person Pitch</i> proved massively influential on an entire generation of DIY musicians, and is considered one of the building blocks for the 2010s chillwave subgenre. Its reach extended to the other members of Animal Collective themselves, who drew from Lennox’s love of the low end for their own epochal <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> in 2009.\n\nDespite <i>Person Pitch</i>’s seismic impact on indie, its seven songs—five relative miniatures anchored by two sweeping epics (the oceanic “Bros” and the hypnotic raga of “Good Girl/Carrots”)—have an intimate, homespun feel. It’s electronic music with an unusual tactility; you can practically feel Lennox’s fingers press the buttons on the Boss SP-303 sampler that he used to assemble the album. His lyrics are achingly personal, even as they resemble sparse mantras and nakedly sincere koans, from his meditations about depression on the gently shaking “Take Pills”’ to the devotional pleas for authenticity on the booming “Comfy in Nautica”. Anchoring it all is Lennox’s uncanny beam of a voice, which rings like a bell and carries a distinct loveliness. It’s a record that, beneath thickets of dense and disorienting sound, isn’t afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve—a sense of honest expression that has cemented <i>Person Pitch</i> as a generational classic, and defines Lennox’s singular career as a whole.",

Largely composed using a pair of Roland SP-303 samplers, Person Pitch was a stylistic leap from Lennox's previous album, the primarily acoustic Young Prayer (2004). He described the album as \"kind of sugary ... super dubby and old sounding\" songs inspired by his recent marriage and fatherhood.\n\nThe album was met with universal critical acclaim, and later ranked among various \"top 10 albums of the 2000s\" lists. It is noted for influencing a wide range of subsequent indie music, inspiring the chillwave genre in addition to numerous soundalike acts. Five of the album's seven tracks were issued as A-sided singles before the album's release: \"I'm Not\", \"Comfy in Nautica\", \"Bros\", \"Carrots\", and \"Take Pills\".\n\nPerson Pitch exhibits a much brighter sound from Lennox's previous album, Young Prayer, with Lennox himself describing the songs in advance as \"super dubby and old sounding, like Motown or Buddy Holly just a little bit.\" Dusted Magazine attributed this to his move to Portugal. Seeing this connection and the change of atmosphere in his music; Lennox says:\n\n\"A lot of the songs on Person Pitch are kind of sugary.  It's really mellow and sunny here  and I feel like the album really sounds like that to me. Also the stuff that's happened to me in the past two years, like getting married and having a kid and all that, has had a pretty profound impact on the kind of music I play and the kind of subjects I address. My approach to being a musician has drastically changed from having a kid and being a provider. It was kind of terrifying at first, I won't lie to you. It's made me feel like I don't want to fuck up, and I want to make sure I cover all my bases. And that's not to say that I suddenly want to make music that's going to sell a whole lot of copies cause I don't really think I could do that. But I want to make sure that whatever I'm doing, I'm doing it to the fullest extent that I can.\"\n\nInitially, Lennox wanted to name it Perfect Pitch before settling on Person Pitch – \"pitch being sound and person being a person with person pitch being a sound of a person.\" Mixing for the album was handled by Rusty Santos. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Panda+Bear/Person+Pitch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Person Pitch is the third solo album released by American recording artist Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), released on March 20, 2007. Largely composed using a pair of Roland SP-303 samplers, Person Pitch was a stylistic leap from Lennox's previous album, the primarily acoustic Young Prayer (2004). He described the album as \"kind of sugary ... super dubby and old sounding\" songs inspired by his recent marriage and fatherhood.\n\nThe album was met with universal critical acclaim, and later ranked among various \"top 10 albums of the 2000s\" lists. It is noted for influencing a wide range of subsequent indie music, inspiring the chillwave genre in addition to numerous soundalike acts. Five of the album's seven tracks were issued as A-sided singles before the album's release: \"I'm Not\", \"Comfy in Nautica\", \"Bros\", \"Carrots\", and \"Take Pills\".\n\nPerson Pitch exhibits a much brighter sound from Lennox's previous album, Young Prayer, with Lennox himself describing the songs in advance as \"super dubby and old sounding, like Motown or Buddy Holly just a little bit.\" Dusted Magazine attributed this to his move to Portugal. Seeing this connection and the change of atmosphere in his music; Lennox says:\n\n\"A lot of the songs on Person Pitch are kind of sugary.  It's really mellow and sunny here  and I feel like the album really sounds like that to me. Also the stuff that's happened to me in the past two years, like getting married and having a kid and all that, has had a pretty profound impact on the kind of music I play and the kind of subjects I address. My approach to being a musician has drastically changed from having a kid and being a provider. It was kind of terrifying at first, I won't lie to you. It's made me feel like I don't want to fuck up, and I want to make sure I cover all my bases. And that's not to say that I suddenly want to make music that's going to sell a whole lot of copies cause I don't really think I could do that. But I want to make sure that whatever I'm doing, I'm doing it to the fullest extent that I can.\"\n\nInitially, Lennox wanted to name it Perfect Pitch before settling on Person Pitch – \"pitch being sound and person being a person with person pitch being a sound of a person.\" Mixing for the album was handled by Rusty Santos. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Panda+Bear/Person+Pitch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
