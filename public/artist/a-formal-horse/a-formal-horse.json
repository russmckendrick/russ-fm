  "biography": "A Formal Horse is a new progressive rock quartet based in Southampton. Although the band's sound is difficult to pinpoint, their dense instrumental passages are reminiscent of King Crimson and Mahavishnu Orchestra, whilst Francesca Lewis' lead vocals evoke the whimsical surrealism of the 1970s Canterbury scene. However, A Formal Horse go beyond simply regurgitating the music of their predecessors. With influences as diverse as Bartok and Bon Iver, the band prove that there is still much territory to be explored in the field of British progressive rock.They have recently recorded their debut EP with Rob Aubrey (IQ, Big Big Train). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/A+Formal+Horse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
