      "biography": "William John Paul Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band  Oasis, which he co-founded in 1991. He later fronted the band Beady Eye from 2010 to 2014 before launching a solo career in 2017. Gallagher is regarded as one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music and is known for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken manner.\n\nGallagher joined a band initially known as the Rain. Following mutual agreement among its members, the band was renamed Oasis. His older brother, Noel Gallagher, was first approached to manage the group but later joined as lead guitarist. Oasis released their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe\", in 1994 to critical and commercial success amid the rise of Britpop. Their second album, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", released in 1995, achieved international chart success, while their third album, \"Be Here Now\" (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Although Britpop declined in popularity towards the end of the 1990s, Oasis continued to release commercially successful albums, all of which topped the UK Albums Chart. The band performed to large audiences worldwide, particularly in Europe and South America. In August 2009, following Noel Gallagher’s departure from Oasis, Liam Gallagher and the remaining members formed Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums before disbanding in 2014.\n\nGallagher began his solo career in 2017 with the release of his debut album \"As You Were\", which was both a critical and commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. The album was later certified platinum in the UK. His second solo album, \"Why Me? Why Not\", released in 2019, also reached number one and became the fastest-selling vinyl record of that year. This marked Gallagher’s tenth number one album, including his work with Oasis. His third solo album, \"C’mon You Know\", released in 2022, also debuted at number one in the UK. In 2024, Gallagher collaborated with former Stone Roses guitarist John Squire on the studio album \"Liam Gallagher & John Squire\", released on 1 March 2024.\n\nGallagher's career with Oasis was marked by public disputes with his brother Noel and frequent media coverage of their personal behaviour. The band’s rivalry with fellow Britpop group Blur also received significant attention during the 1990s. In 2010, Gallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a Q magazine reader poll. In 2019, he was awarded the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Gallagher\n\nStudio albums\nAs You Were (2017)\nWhy Me? Why Not.

      "biography": "John Squire (born John Thomas Squire on November 24, 1962) is an English musician, guitarist and artist. He was a founding member of The Stone Roses and The Seahorses.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1996 he was the guitarist for The Stone Roses, one of the most influential acts of its era. He grew up on Sylvan Avenue in Timperley and after attending Heyes lane Junior School, he passed the 11+ exam and went on to attend Altrincham Grammar School for Boys where he met Ian Brown - who co-incidentally also lived on Sylvan Avenue but went to a different primary school. His partnership with Roses' lead singer Ian Brown (who he had been friends with since their teens when they had bonded over a love for punk rock) formed the heart of the band's lyrical and musical output. As a guitarist, Squire was known for his spiralling riffs and amazing live solos. He was arguably the most accomplished British rock guitarist of the 1980s.\n\nBand infighting and rumoured cocaine abuse led to his departure from The Stone Roses in 1996. He promptly formed his own band, The Seahorses (an anagram of 'he hates roses', but whether this was intentional is disputed). The album Do it Yourself was released in 1997, but The Seahorses disbanded due to creative differences in 1999.\n\nFollowing a three year hiatus, Squire finally released his first solo album, Time Changes Everything  in 2002. A concept album followed in 2004 entitled Marshall's House .\n\nBesides music, Squire is also an accomplished artist. His artwork has adorned album covers and promotional posters for his music. In the 1980s, Squire's artistic style was heavily influenced by the action painting technique of Jackson Pollock. In recent years, Squire has shown a broader use of mediums and has incorporated newer influences to his work. One of his artworks formed the cover for Travis's 1997 release U16 Girls. In 2004, Squire held two well-received art exhibitions in London and Manchester.\n\nAlthough it has almost been a decade since he left the Roses, Squire still has a lasting feud with ex-bandmate Ian Brown. In a 2005 Q magazine article, Squire blasted Brown, claiming that \"When he (Brown) was stoned, he was at best a tuneless knob and at worst a paranoid mess\" (but he was only responding to queries about what went wrong with the Second Coming sessions and the state of Brown's vocal due to his marijuana habits). Although both Brown and Squire have performed Stone Roses songs in their solo gigs, a band reunion seems unlikely. Surprisingly, in May 2005 Squire hinted at intentions for a Roses reunion at Glastonbury that year.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Squire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2020, a thumb he’d broken while playing basketball with his son was struggling to heal and he worried he might never be able to play guitar again. Before that, The Stone Roses—the Manchester band with which he’d helped to completely dilate the horizons of indie music during the late ’80s and early ’90s—had seemed to wither to a final close when their 2016-17 reunion produced two new songs but no desire on any member’s part to make another album. Going into the 2020s, Squire seemed more consumed by his work as a visual artist.\n\nNevertheless, in early 2022, his thumb righted by physiotherapy, Squire had a nagging sense that he wasn’t quite done with music. “I started thinking I’d like to get back out there,” he told Apple Music’ Radio’s Zane Lowe. “‘Have I still got it in me?’ I started putting some ideas together. I wouldn’t say they were songs, they were more like glorified riffs.” He’d had a thought that he might find a female singer to help flesh out those ideas, but then his guest appearance at Liam Gallagher’s Knebworth concert that June sparked a different idea: What if he asked the Oasis man to sing them? It was a question worth asking. Before the end of the year, Gallagher was in Squire’s home studio in Macclesfield, recording demos and igniting Squire’s creative zeal again. “On paper, it’s a slam dunk but to actually hear it and feel that magic was amazing,” said Squire. “The buzz for me has always been that moment of conception when you realise you’ve got something great. When you’re doing that within the framework of a band and an album and gigs, you know all that’s coming down the line at you once you’ve completed the song—there’s nothing better than that feeling. It’s like, ‘I’m the first person that’s heard this and it’s going to travel, it’s going to be released into the wild and do some damage.’”\n\nFor his part, Gallagher was just chuffed to be working with one of his musical heroes. “John going, ‘Look, I’m back to writing songs and that again,’ made me happy regardless of me singing on them,” Gallagher told Lowe. “These songs came my way and I was double pleased to sing them. I love them. I think John’s equally as good [at songwriting] as he is playing a guitar. I’m sure people know that anyway, but it’s nice if more people get to know it.” You can sense the duo’s mutual satisfaction in an album that was recorded over a two-week period in LA with producer Greg Kurstin, a collaborator on Gallagher’s three solo records. While the core elements are familiar—Squire’s roaming, nimble guitar lines, Gallagher’s serrated voice—nothing feels tired or overcooked. Instead, buoyed by the strength of Squire’s melodies, the two turn in performances that might be their best since the Roses and Oasis heydays. Writing the words and music, Squire gives Gallagher moods and colours he’s always worked well with—sneering disdain (“I’m so Bored”), sore-headed yearning (“Mars to Liverpool”) and measured psychedelia (“Love You Forever”)—and successfully coaxes him onto relatively new ground (the blues on “I’m a Wheel”).\n\nThe world’s recording studios are littered with the ghosts and abandoned recordings of stellar collaborations that should have worked on paper but didn’t create any chemistry on tape. Gallagher thinks his particular super-duo has succeeded for a simple reason. “John’s guitars are lairy, man, and my vocals can be as well,” he said. “I think it lends well to it. [It’s not that] one’s light and one’s heavy. They’re both just fucking coming at you.”",
