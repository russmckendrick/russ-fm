  "biography": "Jack White (born John Anthony Gillis on 9 July 1975 in Detroit, MI, United States) is an American rock musician, producer and actor. He rose to prominence as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and, after that, as the guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather, two bands that are still active on and off. White is also a recording artist in his own right and under his own name.\n\nJack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song 'Portland Oregon'.  \n\nWhite's début solo single, 'Love Interruption', was made available on 30 January 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and on jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer’s preferred format, vinyl. Recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville it was paired with the exclusive non-LP B-side, 'Machine Gun Silhouette'. The single was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012.\n\nMore solo albums followed: Lazaretto (2014), Boarding House reach (2018), Fear of the Dawn (2022), Entering Heaven Alive (2022) and, perhaps his loudest rocking and most White Stripe-ish sounding solo album to date, No Name (2024). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jack+White\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
