      "biography": "Yes are an English rock band who achieved success with their progressive, art and symphonic style of music. They are distinguished by their use of mystical and cosmic lyrics, live stage sets and lengthy compositions, often with complex instrumental and vocal arrangements. Seventeen musicians have been members of the band in its history; the current line-up since February 2012 consists of singer Jon Davison, guitarist Steve Howe, bass guitarist Chris Squire, keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Alan White.\nSquire formed Yes in 1968 with singer Jon Anderson. Squire and guitarist Peter Banks had played together in The Syn and then Mabel Greer's Toyshop. Anderson and later drummer Bill Bruford joined a later line-up of Mabel Greer's Toyshop, which evolved into Yes. Keyboardist Tony Kaye completed the first Yes line-up. Their first two albums received lukewarm sales and reception. Early sets were a mix of original material and cover versions by other artists. In the 1970s, Yes reached their creative peak in the progressive genre when most notably Anderson, Squire, Howe, Bruford, White, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman were part of the band's line-ups, and produced what many critics consider their finest works: The Yes Album, Fragile (both in 1971), Close to the Edge (1972), Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973), Relayer (1974) and Going for the One (1977). The rise of punk rock at the end of the decade led to a decline in creativity and sales; in 1980, Anderson and Wakeman left the band and the album Drama featuring Downes and new vocalist Trevor Horn was released. The following year, all band members except Howe and Downes left the band due to personal and musical differences; instead of continuing as Yes, they disbanded the group and created Asia.\nYes reformed in 1982 with Anderson, Squire, White, original keyboardist Kaye and guitarist Trevor Rabin and adopted a more pop rock sound. Their sales peaked across the decade with 90125 (1983), which spawned the US number one single \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and Big Generator (1987). The tour in support of Union (1991), which amalgamated members of Yes and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, was a commercial success that featured an eight-man line-up (instead of a quintet). Subsequent albums and singles have been commercially unsuccessful. The band toured worldwide between 1997 and 2004 that included their 30th and 35th anniversary shows. After a four-year hiatus due to health issues from Anderson and Wakeman, Yes resumed touring after replacing them with Benoît David and Oliver Wakeman respectively. In 2011 they released Fly from Here featuring Downes, who returned on keyboards after 30 years, and the following year David left the band due to illness and was replaced by Davison from band Glass Hammer.\nYes are one of the most popular, influent and critically acclaimed acts in the history of the progressive genre, and have influenced bands such as Dream Theater. Nine of their twenty studio albums have reached the top ten in either the UK or the US charts, with two reaching the number one spot in the UK. They have sold 13.5 million certified units in the US.",

            "content": "Going for the One is the eighth studio album by British progressive rock band Yes. It was released in 1977 after an extended break for solo activity, and is especially notable for marking the return of keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who had departed in 1974 in the aftermath of the Tales from Topographic Oceans tour. His re-entry was facilitated by the departure of Patrick Moraz, after having only played on Relayer, although Moraz is thanked in the credits.\n\nAfter their extended break, the band regrouped in Switzerland, refreshed and ready to record in late 1976. The album was recorded at Mountain Studios by recording engineers John Timperley and David Richards. After constructing epic tracks for the last few years, Yes felt inspired to scale things back a bit and recorded some of their most direct and concise material since Fragile. Wakeman also varied his sound by largely forsaking his mellotron and experimenting with church organ to pleasing effect on \"Parallels\" and the sole extended track, \"Awaken\".\n\nAfter many successive album covers with Roger Dean, Yes (who also produced the album entirely by themselves) instead commissioned Hipgnosis (known for designing album covers for Pink Floyd) to create the artwork for Going for the One. The album cover features the Century Plaza Towers in Los Angeles, also known locally as the Twin Towers.\n\nYes's return at the height of the punk movement was an unexpectedly successful one, with Going for the One reaching the pinnacle of the UK charts and even having a Top 10 hit single with \"Wonderous Stories\" - something that would have been considered impossible during the days of Tales from Topographic Oceans. The album was another U.S. Top 10 charting album for the band reaching #8 on the Billboard album chart in 1977.\n\nWith its confident and natural qualities, Going for the One is still generally regarded by most critics as one of Yes's finest, and many times, most underrated albums. In addition, the song \"Awaken\" is considered by many fans to be Yes's finest work, and Jon Anderson has said \"We had a hit record! I loved listening to 'Awaken', at last we had created a Masterwork\" and has indicated in some interviews that he considers it to be Yes's most complete composition. \n\n\n\n Side one\n\"Going for the One\" (Jon Anderson) – 5:32 \n\"Turn of the Century\" (Jon Anderson/Steve Howe/Alan White) – 7:56 \n\"Parallels\" (Chris Squire) – 5:53 \n\n Side two\n\"Wonderous Stories\" (Jon Anderson) – 3:49 \n\"Awaken\" (Jon Anderson/Steve Howe) – 15:31 \n\nBonus Tracks\nGoing for the One was remastered and reissued by Rhino in 2003 with several bonus tracks:\n\n\"Montreux's Theme\" (Steve Howe/Chris Squire/Jon Anderson/Alan White) – 2:38 \n\"Vevey (Revisited)\" (Jon Anderson/Rick Wakeman) – 4:46 \n\"Amazing Grace\" (Trad.
