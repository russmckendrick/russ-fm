      "biography": "Sigur Rós are an Icelandic post-rock band. The name is derived from the name of lead vocalist Jónsi Birgisson's little sister, Sigurrós. They hail from the same creative and vibrant Icelandic music scene as múm and Amiina. They released their first-ever foray into film-making with their tour documentary, Heima in late 2007. \n\nJón Þór Birgisson (Jónsi), Georg Hólm, and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson formed the group in Reykjavík, Iceland in August 1994. They soon won a record deal with a local record label, Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). In 1997, they released Von (Hope) and in 1998, released a remix collection named Von brigði. The name is Icelandic wordplay: Vonbrigði means \"disappointment,\" but Von brigði means \"hope alteration.\" (In English, the album is sometimes known by the alternative name \"Recycle Bin.\")\n\nInternational acclaim came with 1999's Ágætis Byrjun (\"An alright start\"), for which the band were joined by Kjartan Sveinsson. The album's reputation slowly spread by word of mouth over the next two years. Soon, many critics worldwide hailed it as one of the best albums of its time, and the band was playing with Radiohead and other big names. Drummer Ágúst left the band after the recording of Ágætis Byrjun and was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason.\n\nAfter the release of Ágætis Byrjun, the band became perhaps most well known for Birgisson's signature style of playing guitar with the bow from a cello, accentuated with reverb, creating a sweeping, fluid sound that is unique for an electric guitar. \n\nIn early 2001, Sigur Rós set out to record some songs in their newly-completed álafoss swimming pool studio with their friend Steindór Andersen who is a fisherman and chairman of the Icelandic poetry society, Iðunn. Steindór is a chanter/singer of the traditional Icelandic epic poetry form, called \"rímur,\" for which the band named their next EP, Rímur. Only 1000 copies of the EP were printed and sold in the spring tour of 2001. \n\nIn 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release, all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. Famously, all of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in vonlenska (\"Hopelandic\"), nonsensical vocalizations that resemble the sound of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics, which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.\n\nIn October of 2003, Sigur Rós joined Radiohead in composing music for Merce Cunningham's dance piece Split Sides; Sigur Rós’s three tracks were named \"Ba Ba,\" \"Ti Ki,\" and \"Di Do\" and released in March of 2004 on an EP titled Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do The three songs are separate tracks, but the band intended that all three be played at the same time to form one single song. The band's 1997 debut album Von also finally found a United States and United Kingdom release in October of 2004. Their latest full-length album, Takk... (Thanks...), was released on September 13, 2005, with a free legal download of their first single, \"Glósóli,\" made available on August 15. For North American fans, \"Sæglópur\" was made available for download on August 16.\"Hoppípolla,\" the second official single from Takk..., was released on November 28 alongside a new studio remake of \"Hafsól,\" a song which was previously released on the band's 1997 debut, Von. \n\nSæglópur EP was released on July 10 in most parts of the world and on August 8 in the United States. Its original release date was May 8, but because of the sudden demand of \"Hoppípolla,\" especially in the UK due to its inclusion on BBC's \"Planet Earth,\" it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Rós recorded three new songs for the EP: \"Refur,\" \"Ófriður,\" and \"Kafari.\"\n\nThe Hvarf/Heim double album was released on November 5, 2007. Hvarf contains reworkings of songs dating back to the bands' first album, whereas Heim contains live acoustic versions of more well-known songs. The double album was an accompaniment to the film Heima. Heima is a documentary showing footage of the band's tour of Iceland, including live footage and interviews. The official web site is www.heimafilm.com.\n\nSigur Rós has sold over 2.5 million albums worldwide.\n\nOn June 23, 2008, they released Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust. \nThe single \"Gobbledigook\" was available for a free download on their website.\n\nIn January 2010, the band began a hiatus, and they are now working on new material. On August 11, 2011, the band's website showed a trailer for a project called Inni. A week later, the project was revealed to be a new live album and DVD, although the release date is currently unknown.\n\nSigur Rós'' sixth studio album, Valtari, was released on May 29, 2012 on Parlophone.\n\nIn January 2013, Kjartan Sveinsson left the band and was not replaced. Sigur Rós's first album following his departure was titled Kveikur and released in June 2013.\n\nIn 2014, the band made a guest appearance in the HBO show 'Game of Thrones,' performing The Rains of Castamere in the 2nd episode of the 4th season.\n\n\nWebsites\nBoth websites include discography, band trivia, song lyrics, and news: http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk and http://www.sigurros.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sigur+R%C3%B3s\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "Entirely in keeping with its musical content, the mammoth success of 1999’s <i>Ágætis byrjun</i> was slow-burning. Sigur Rós’s second record turned the then-quartet from Iceland into international stars and introduced a new sound into mainstream music. Post-rock had existed before, but not like this, so monumental and majestic and elegant. If Sigur Rós didn’t exist, no one would’ve thought to invent them—this was music that sounded like it had been beamed in from another galaxy.\n\nThe band—vocalist and guitarist Jón Þór “Jónsi” Birgisson, keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson, bassist Georg “Goggi” Hólm and drummer Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson—had a feeling the album they were working on was special but they couldn’t have had any idea just how far and wide <i>Ágætis byrjun</i> would travel. Their 1997 debut <i>Von</i>had, after all, sold just over 300 copies. But there was an almost punk-rock attitude to the quartet in the manner that they stuck to a crystal-clear sonic vision (and persuaded Icelandic label Smekkleysa to foot the bill). With recording completed, they certainly felt bold—ahead of release, Jónsi wrote on the band’s website, “We are simply gonna change music forever.”\n\nIt was not an immediate transformation but word soon spread. With music this irrepressible, it felt inevitable. These were songs (if you could call them songs) that paired rock dynamism with neoclassical sensibilities and ambient explorations. That some of the elements that made <i>Ágætis byrjun</i> so jaw-dropping happened by accident—like Hólm trying out a cello bow on his bass, discarding it because it didn’t sound any good only for Jónsi to give it a try on his guitar and create that gaping trademark drone—only adds to the magic. \n\nIn “Svefn-G-Englar”, the 10-minute epic that would become the album’s calling card, they had a song that sounded like a spaceship landing in slow motion, art rock but not as you knew it, ethereal and delicate but in the way that a mountain covered in snow looks ethereal and delicate from a distance. It’s a record that glides by in moments of wonder, from the stark orchestral drama of “Starálfur” to the experimental rock thump that detonates at the end of the otherwise gentle “Ný Batteri” to the joyous choral singing that brings “Olsen Olsen”’s sway to a close. It didn’t matter that the majority of listeners couldn’t understand what Jónsi was singing, his vocals mostly delivered in Icelandic but also in his fictional Hopelandish, it was about the way he sang, a falsetto that sounded like it was battling the elements. It was the perfect voice for music rooted in emotional connection.\n\nIn 2000, a year after its Icelandic bow, <i>Ágætis byrjun</i> was released in the UK, with a US release following the year after. Somewhere in between, Radiohead invited Sigur Rós on tour as a support act. Momentum was with them. The record went on to sell over half a million copies, with some of its songs used to soundtrack poignant moments in Hollywood movies. More than that, though, it was the soundtrack to a new millennium. As one century slipped into the next, Sigur Rós gifted the world with their strange beauty. As Jónsi predicted, they simply changed music forever.",

Their 1997 debut <i>Von</i>had, after all, sold just over 300 copies. But there was an almost punk-rock attitude to the quartet in the manner that they stuck to a crystal-clear sonic vision (and persuaded Icelandic label Smekkleysa to foot the bill). With recording completed, they certainly felt bold—ahead of release, Jónsi wrote on the band’s website, “We are simply gonna change music forever.”\n\nIt was not an immediate transformation but word soon spread. With music this irrepressible, it felt inevitable. These were songs (if you could call them songs) that paired rock dynamism with neoclassical sensibilities and ambient explorations. That some of the elements that made <i>Ágætis byrjun</i> so jaw-dropping happened by accident—like Hólm trying out a cello bow on his bass, discarding it because it didn’t sound any good only for Jónsi to give it a try on his guitar and create that gaping trademark drone—only adds to the magic. \n\nIn “Svefn-G-Englar”, the 10-minute epic that would become the album’s calling card, they had a song that sounded like a spaceship landing in slow motion, art rock but not as you knew it, ethereal and delicate but in the way that a mountain covered in snow looks ethereal and delicate from a distance. It’s a record that glides by in moments of wonder, from the stark orchestral drama of “Starálfur” to the experimental rock thump that detonates at the end of the otherwise gentle “Ný Batteri” to the joyous choral singing that brings “Olsen Olsen”’s sway to a close. It didn’t matter that the majority of listeners couldn’t understand what Jónsi was singing, his vocals mostly delivered in Icelandic but also in his fictional Hopelandish, it was about the way he sang, a falsetto that sounded like it was battling the elements. It was the perfect voice for music rooted in emotional connection.\n\nIn 2000, a year after its Icelandic bow, <i>Ágætis byrjun</i> was released in the UK, with a US release following the year after. Somewhere in between, Radiohead invited Sigur Rós on tour as a support act. Momentum was with them. The record went on to sell over half a million copies, with some of its songs used to soundtrack poignant moments in Hollywood movies. More than that, though, it was the soundtrack to a new millennium. As one century slipped into the next, Sigur Rós gifted the world with their strange beauty. As Jónsi predicted, they simply changed music forever.",

This album began a hype storm for the previously unheard band, earning endorsements from many critics and musicians, famously including Thom Yorke's glowing approval. It is generally considered their best-liked album, and it appeared on many critics' \"best of 2000 / 2001\" record lists.\n\nThe album's title came from a friend hearing the first song they had written for the album, which would become the title track. After hearing the song, he said it was \"a good beginning\"; the name stuck. The name has also been translated as \"An alright start.\"\nSigur Rós won an Iceland Music Award  and the 2001 Shortlist Music Prize for this album.\n\nCompared to their first record, Ágætis byrjun has a spectacular level of production, causing their magical, lullaby post-rock sound to manifest in all of its glory for the first time. Also, this album incorporated more kinds of instruments than the debut. The band is lumped into the post-rock category because they play slow, lengthy compositions that feature classical-style arrangements and themes played by string sections and other instruments, while utilizing rock crescendo effects similar to Godspeed You! Black Emperor. A main point of divergence from other post-rock groups of their time is their use of vocals instead of just instrumental jams; their singer Jónsi Birgisson has a strong, siren-like falsetto which he uses to intone Icelandic-language lyrics as well as Hopelandic lyrics, which is their own, made-up language (featured on track 8, \"Olsen Olsen\" and the whole of the third LP.)\n\nThis record is full of spectacularly huge moments of heartbreaking beauty, which has drawn the band's admirers to revere them for their awesome power of creating entrancing, otherworldly music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sigur+R%C3%B3s/%C3%81g%C3%A6tis+byrjun\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
