      "biography": "Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright was pushed out of Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters decision to leave in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was created using unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions, along with new recordings. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason released the most recent Pink Floyd recording, the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  As of 2024, the band is back on hiatus, with Gilmour stating his willingness to reconvene under the right circumstances.\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Album Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd\n\nStudio albums\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)\nA Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\nMore (1969)\nUmmagumma (1969)\nAtom Heart Mother (1970)\nMeddle (1971)\nObscured by Clouds (1972)\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973)\nWish You Were Here (1975)\nAnimals (1977)\nThe Wall (1979)\nThe Final Cut (1983)\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)\nThe Division Bell (1994)\nThe Endless River (2014) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Pulse (stylized as P•U•L•S•E) is a live double CD by Pink Floyd, released on May 29, 1995 in the UK and on June 6, 1995 in the US, containing songs from their albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and The Division Bell.\n\nThe album was recorded during the band's Division Bell tour in 1994, specifically the UK and European leg, which ran from July to October 1994 (See Pink Floyd live performances).\n\nThe album includes a complete live version of The Dark Side of the Moon and features a booklet with many photos from performances on this tour. It also features \"Astronomy Domine,\" a Syd Barrett song not performed since the early 1970s, as a tribute to the original Floyd guitarist.\n\nUnlike Delicate Sound of Thunder, David Gilmour and producer James Guthrie have stated that no parts of the songs were re-recorded in the studio. However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg.\n\nIn the U.S., Pulse debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 in June 1995 (briefly dethroning Hootie and the Blowfish's Cracked Rear View for a week before Hootie regained the #1 spot in the U.S.) and was soon certified Double Platinum on July 31, 1995.\n\nThe cassette issue had two bonus tracks: \"One of These Days\" and a 22 minute ambient piece that was played prior to the 1994 concerts.\n\nThe vinyl version comes in a four-LP box and includes \"One of These Days\" as well as a large version of the photo booklet. The video version (the only release of Pulse with an accurate running order) also featured the song \"Take It Back,\" and was, in fact, the near complete performance from their October 20th show at Earl's Court, London.\n\nOn July 10, 2006, the Pulse DVD was released of the concert performed on October 20, 1994 at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London.\n\nThe original CD cover features a \"eye-like\" machine that has clock pieces inside, there is a planet in its center, and on the outside it shows evolution as it moves backwards. It starts in the sea, moves to the bacterias which evolve into fishes, then into egg type creatures, then into eggs that hatch birds, and birds follow the trail of an airplane. There are six pyramids in the desert, and in the bottom of the sea, you can observe a city in the shore.\n\nLED\nEarly CD versions came with a blinking red LED on the side of the case, that flashed to the heartbeat heard at the beginning of Dark Side of the Moon. This was designed by EMI contractor Jon Kempner (who incidentally was awarded the platinum disc) using the (now discontinued) LM3909 LED flasher IC. The circuit was powered by a single AA cell; this was theoretically replaceable in that it was fitted in a battery holder rather than soldered onto the circuit board. However, the circuit board is hidden behind a glued-in cardboard cover; removing it from the case to replace the battery requires careful use of a long-handled scalpel. In some cases, the battery holder was fitted to the circuit board the wrong way round, so the \"+\" and \"-\" markings on holder and cell do not correspond. The battery life was stated to be over 6 months.\n\nSome versions were also made with 2 AA batteries that were easier to replace. The LED and battery can be removed by rapping the open end of the case on a firm surface until the cardboard flap attached to the battery compartment slides out far enough. This flap can be used to gently pull the circuit compartment out the rest of the way and replace the batteries.\n\nLater editions of the CD set did not feature the blinking LED.\n\nThe complete text from the sleeve notes concerning the LED reads:\n\nMight we suggest that if the pulsing LED begins to drive you crazy, turn the box round so the LED faces to the wall or the back of your shelf. If it begins to drive you really crazy, then separate the outer slip case from the book, leave the book in your CD collection, and put the slip case in your car or potting shed where it might look and act like a burglar alarm. The battery for the LED should last more than six months and is replaceable, if you can get to it, that is, without trashing the case. The battery must not, of course, be exposed to fire or high temperatures which can cause cells to leak or explode. The LED is set at the average human pulse speed so it can be used as an anti stress device - just check your own pulse against it. It is designed primarily for easy finding thereby avoiding uncomfortable neck twisting or eye squinting to read the spine. The LED is also like the opening heartbeat of the Dark Side of the Moon. Most particularly the LED pulses... it is a live phenomenon... like the music.\n\nThe debut of the album was highlighted by a minor light show from the top of the Empire State Building in New York City.\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc one\nLead vocals performed by David Gilmour unless stated otherwise.\n\n\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5 and 7)\" (David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Richard Wright) – 13:35 \nEarls Court, London on October 20, 1994 \n\n\"Astronomy Domine\" (Syd Barrett) – 4:20 \nEarls Court, London on October 15, 1994 \nLead vocals: Richard Wright and David Gilmour \n\n\"What Do You Want from Me\" (Gilmour, Wright, Polly Samson) – 4:10 \nRome, September 21, 1994 \n\n\"Learning to Fly\" (Gilmour, Anthony Moore, Bob Ezrin, Jon Carin) – 5:16 \nEarls Court, London on October 14, 1994 \n\n\"Keep Talking\" (Gilmour, Wright, Samson) – 6:52 \nHannover, August 17, 1994 \n\n\"Coming Back to Life\" (Gilmour) – 6:56 \nEarls Court, London on October 13, 1994 \n\n\"Hey You\" (Waters) – 4:40 \nEarls Court, London on October 13 + 15 (last verse), 1994 \nLead vocals: David Gilmour and Jon Carin \n\n\"A Great Day for Freedom\" (Gilmour, Samson) – 4:30 \nEarls Court, London on October 19, 1994 \n\n\"Sorrow\" (Gilmour) – 10:49 \nRome, September 20, 1994 \n\n\"High Hopes\" (Gilmour, Samson) – 7:52 \nEarls Court, London on October 20, 1994.
