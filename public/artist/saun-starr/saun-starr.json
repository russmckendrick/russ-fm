  "biography": "Saun & Starr is a retro-soul duo comprised of Saundra Williams and Starr Duncan Lowe, both hailing from the Bronx, New York. Their musical journey began in 1986 when they met at an open mic night at the legendary Lenox Lounge in Harlem, a venue that hosted jazz giants like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis. They quickly became friends and began performing together, eventually joining forces with the late Sharon Jones in a group initially called The Good 'N Plenty Girls, later known as The Dapettes - a name that paid homage to the classic soul groups of the 1960s.\n\nAfter meeting in 1986, they performed with various artists, including regular appearances at the historic Apollo Theater's Amateur Night. Their powerful harmonies and dynamic stage presence caught the attention of local promoters, leading to collaborations with established R&B acts. Their chemistry with Sharon Jones was instantaneous, reminiscent of the backing vocal traditions of groups like The Sweet Inspirations and The Raelettes.\n\nIn 2013, encouraged by Daptone Records co-founder Gabriel Roth, Saun & Starr began to focus on their own music. Their debut album Look Closer was recorded using vintage equipment and analog tape to capture the authentic sound of 1960s soul music. The album features the Grammy-nominated Dap-Kings and includes the hit single Hot Shot, which sold over 2,000 copies in its first week, demonstrating the enduring appeal of traditional soul music in the modern era.\n\nTheir debut album has received critical acclaim from publications like Rolling Stone and NPR Music, with particular praise for their authentic approach to classic soul. Their live performances, featuring elaborate choreography and vintage-inspired costumes, have become legendary in the soul revival scene, selling out venues across Europe and North America.\n\nSaun & Starr's music is characterized by its authentic retro-soul sound, drawing inspiration from the golden age of soul music (1965-1975). Their vocal arrangements often feature complex harmonies reminiscent of The Supremes and Aretha Franklin's backing vocalists, while their rhythmic approach incorporates elements of gospel, early R&B, and Memphis soul. Their performances are distinguished by their powerful harmonies, engaging stage presence, and the use of traditional soul music arrangements featuring horn sections, Hammond organ, and analog recording techniques.\n\nTheir work continues to resonate with audiences, bridging the gap between classic soul and contemporary music while maintaining the authenticity and emotional depth that characterized the golden age of soul music. Their success has helped pave the way for other artists in the modern soul revival movement, proving that traditional soul music remains relevant and powerful in the 21st century.\nhttp://www.saunandstarr.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Saun+&+Starr\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
