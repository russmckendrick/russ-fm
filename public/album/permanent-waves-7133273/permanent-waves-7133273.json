      "biography": "Rush is a Canadian rock band formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal on their first album, then encompassing hard rock, progressive rock, and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. They have been cited as an influence by various musical artists, including Metallica, Primus, and The Smashing Pumpkins,as well as progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater and Symphony X.\n\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush's sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\nThe band finished the second leg of the Time Machine Tour in July 2011 and released their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels in June 2012 with a supporting tour in the fall.",

            "content": "Permanent Waves is the seventh studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released January 1, 1980 (see 1980 in music). The album was recorded at Le Studio, Morin Heights, Quebec, and was mixed at Trident Studios in London, UK. Permanent Waves became Rush's first US Top 5 album hitting #4 and was the band's fifth Gold (eventually Platinum) selling album. The album also marks a distinct transition into more accessible, radio-friendly numbers and consequently, a significant expansion in the band's record sales with perennial favorites such as \"The Spirit of Radio\" and \"Freewill\" seeing quite a fair bit of radio airplay. Lee's singing style changed, too; his range is much lower than the previous albums.\n\nMusic\n\"The Spirit of Radio\" featured the band's early experiments with a reggae style, which was explored further on Moving Pictures and Signals.\n\nA notable track on Permanent Waves is \"Jacob's Ladder\", a song style reminiscent of their earlier art rock period. Exploring odd time signatures, the song possesses a dark, ominous feel. The song's lyrics are based on a simple concept; a vision of sunlight breaking through storm clouds. The title is a reference to the natural phenomenon of the sun breaking through the clouds in visible rays, which in turn is named after the Biblical ladder to heaven on which Jacob saw angels ascending and descending in a vision.\n\n\"Entre Nous\" (\"Between Us\") is similar in style to \"Freewill,\" yet it did not receive heavy radio airplay. The ballad \"Different Strings\" would polarize many Rush fans and critics; some radio stations would feature the song, while others never played it. While the band began stepping back from the epic song format on this album, \"Natural Science\" does clock in at over nine minutes and is composed of three distinct movements. The lyrics are driven by concepts of natural science, examining themes of evolution, genetics and civilization, as well as man's responsibility to the arts and sciences.\n\nCover art\nThe cover art sparked some controversy due to the appearance of the \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" headline on the newspaper. Due to pressure from the Chicago Tribune, still embarrassed by that fiasco, Hugh Syme changed the text to \"Dewei Defeats Truman\".\n\n\nBackground\nThe writing of the album began in July 1979, at a farmhouse at Lakewoods Farm in Ontario, Canada on the Georgian Bay, Lake Huron while Peart started his lyrics in a cottage near there. They began with an instrumental jam, which they nick-named \"Uncle Tounouse\". Parts of this were used in the songs on the album. While Peart worked on lyrics, Lifeson and Lee would work on musical ideas in the basement. Within a few days they had put together \"The Spirit of Radio\", \"Freewill\", and \"Jacob's Ladder\", which came very natural to them, and it was recorded on a Slider JVC mobile unit. \"Entre Nous\" was the only lyric complete ahead of time.\n\nNeil was working on making a song out of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the medieval epic from King Arthur's time. Based on the story written in the 14th century, he was trying to keep its original style. It was deemed too out of place with the other material and was discarded. They moved into Sound Kitchen studio in Toronto to record demos, joined by producer Terry Brown. \"The Spirit of Radio\", \"Freewill\", and \"Jacob's Ladder\" were further polished on the warm-up tour during soundchecks.\n\nRush headed to Le Studio in Morin Heights, Quebec and began tweaking the settings of instruments and positioning of microphones. They recorded basic tracks with multiple takes until they captured the best performance. While Lee, Lifeson, and Terry Brown began overdubs, Peart began attempting to write another epic song to replace the discarded \"Green Knight\", and after enduring three days of writer's block, \"Natural Science\" was born. Fin Costello was then brought in to photograph the band in the studio. Cover art director Hugh Syme was also brought in and added a piano solo to \"Different Strings\". Music was composed for \"Natural Science\", with some leftover parts from \"Green Knight\". The tide pool effects for the song were created by splashing oars in the private lake, and the natural echo outside was used to record various instruments. The rough mixes on the album were complete, and the final mix was completed in a week at Trident studios, London.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart except where noted.\n\n\"The Spirit of Radio\" – 4:56 \n\"Freewill\" – 5:21 \n\"Jacob's Ladder\" – 7:26 \n\"Entre Nous\" – 4:36 \n\"Different Strings\" (Lifeson, Lee) – 3:48 \n\"Natural Science\" – 9:17 \n\"Tide Pools\" – 2:21 \n\"Hyperspace\" – 2:47 \n\"Permanent Waves\" – 4:08 \n\nPersonnel\nGeddy Lee - Bass guitars, Oberheim polyphonic; OB-1; Minimoog; and Taurus pedal synthesizers, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - Six and twelve string electric and acoustic guitars, Taurus pedals, vocals \nNeil Peart - Drums, tympani, timbales, orchestra bells, tubular bells, wind chimes, bell tree, triangle, crotales, cover concept \nErwig Chuapchuaduah - steel drums \nHugh Syme - piano on \"Different Strings\", art direction, design, cover concept \nDeborah Samuel - photography \nFin Costello - photography \nFlip Schulke - photography \nTerry Brown - arranger, producer, mixing \nPaul Northfield - engineer \nRobbie Whelan - assistant engineer \nCraig Milliner - mixing assistant \nAdam Moseley - mixing assistant \nCover girl couturière: Ou la la \nPaula Turnbull - cover girl \nRay Staff - mastering on original album \nBob Ludwig - remastering \nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1980 Billboard's Pop Albums 4 \n\nSingles\nInformation \n \"The Spirit of Radio\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: #51 US Hot 100; #1 US Mainstream Rock \n \n \"Freewill\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n \"Entre Nous\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n\nRemaster Details\nA remaster was issued in 1997.\n\nThe tray has a picture of star with man painting with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left.
