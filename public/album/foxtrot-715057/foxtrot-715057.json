      "biography": "Genesis are an English rock band that formed in 1967. The band consists of its three longest-tenured members - Tony Banks (keyboards) and Mike Rutherford (bass, guitar), who were founding members; and Phil Collins (vocals, drums), who first joined in 1970. Past members Peter Gabriel (vocals, flute), Steve Hackett (guitar) and Anthony Phillips (guitar) also played major roles in the band in its early years. Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time, with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.\nIn the late 1960s, with the release of their first album, Genesis's music was initially regarded by the band and the fans as a pop experiment, referring to then-popular melodic pop. Then, over the course of a year, (beginning with their second album in mid-1970) they quickly evolved into a progressive rock band with the incorporation of complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation. Their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, extravagant costumes and on-stage stories. This second phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23-minute \"Supper's Ready\" and the 1974 concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. In the late '70s and early '80s the band's musical direction changed once again, becoming more pop oriented and commercially accessible. This resulted in their first top 40 single in the US with \"Follow You Follow Me\", their first number one album in the United Kingdom, Duke, and their only number one single in the United States, \"Invisible Touch\".\nGenesis has undergone several personnel changes throughout its history. Stage fright forced founding member Anthony Phillips to leave the band in 1970. In 1975, Collins, then the band's drummer, replaced Peter Gabriel as lead singer after a lengthy search for a replacement. To facilitate Collins's move to lead vocals during concerts, Bill Bruford and Chester Thompson played drums for the band as they toured, with Collins joining in briefly during lengthy instrumental passages. In 1977, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band. After Phil Collins left the band in 1996, Genesis recruited Ray Wilson (formerly of Stiltskin). Wilson appeared on the 1997 album Calling All Stations, after which the band announced an indefinite hiatus. In 2007, Banks, Collins and Rutherford reunited for a 20-city tour of Europe and North America, which included a free concert at Rome's Circo Massimo in front of 500,000 fans. Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. The future of the band remains uncertain with Collins's retirement from the music business and the other members' solo work.",

Foxtrot was also Genesis' first album to enter the UK charts, reaching # 12 and paving the way for a long and successful chart career for the band. Still, it failed to reach the US charts. It was not the first Genesis album to appear in the charts: Nursery Cryme reached #7 in Italy, making Foxtrot the second album to place in the charts.\n\nBoth Watcher of the Skies, which is based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel Childhood's End, and Supper's Ready rank among some of the band's most beloved works, and became live favourites. \n\nGet 'Em Out by Friday, one of the band's earliest songs with a political message, was inspired by the band's troubles with landlords. The song features several characters and the satirical storyline results in a four-foot restriction on human height so \"they can fit twice as many in the same building site\".\n\nCan-Utility and the Coastliners is based on the legend of King Canute, who supposedly ordered the seas to retreat to mock the sycophancy of his followers. An early, longer version of the song found it's way into pre-album live sets; known as \"Bye Bye Johnny\", it featured an extended instrumental section in which the haunting Mellotron string sound dominated. Sadly for some, this particular version never made it to the recording stage.\n\nHorizons starts with the central idea of Bach's Prelude of the first Cello Suite and then develops its own piece, baroque style. The song accomplishes the function of a prelude.\n\nThe title of the album may be a nod to the Mellotron Mark II used by Tony Banks at the time, which included foxtrot as one of the preset rhythms in its tapeset. The 'fox on the rocks' (a phrase itself reminiscent of the works of Dr. Seuss) is mentioned in the lyrics of the \"Willow Farm\" section of Supper's Ready, and is featured in the album artwork. This figure in a red dress with a fox's head became one of Peter Gabriel's earliest stage costumes.\n\nCorrect track listing:\n1. Watcher of the Skies - 7:22\n2. Time Table - 4:45\n3.
