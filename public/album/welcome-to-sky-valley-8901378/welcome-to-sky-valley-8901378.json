      "biography": "Kyuss  (pronounced /ˈkaɪ.əs/ KYE-əs) are the corner stone of what is known as stoner rock or desert rock. Although deriving influence from 60s-70s hard rock, Kyuss churned out a unique sound. This was primarily because guitarist Josh Homme often tuned to a low C, a major third below standard pitch, but also singer John Garcia's paint stripping vocals.\n\nThe band was originally formed in 1989 in Palm Desert, California under the name \"Sons of Kyuss\". They took the name from a monster in Dungeons and Dragons. Shortly after the release of their self-titled EP, the name was shortened to just Kyuss.\n  \nThe quartet gained popularity around the desert due to their famous generator parties. These were parties fueled by gas generators in the canyons and isolated desert surrounding the small valley towns.\n\nThe group disbanded in 1997. They felt that they were in a decline and felt it best to call it quits before it escalated into something that could not be fixed. The line up had shifted dramatically between 1989 and 1997. Josh Homme, John Garcia, Brant Bjork, and Chris Cockrell were the original members. Chris was replaced by Nick Oliveri during high school. That line up recorded Wretch (released in 1991) and Blues for the Red Sun (released in 1992), after which Nick soon left. The eighteen year older, but very able Scott Reeder from The Obsessed was brought in. This line up recorded the famous self-titled album Kyuss (released in 1994; due to the album front cover often referred to as \"Welcome to Sky Valley\", a small town outside of Palm Desert — wrongly labelled by many). Brank Bjork left after this due to personal reasons. Alfredo Hernandez was brought in.  The final line-up recorded ...And the Circus Leaves Town (released in 1995). The band toured and soon disbanded. With the compilation Muchas Gracias: The best of Kyuss, one final greatest hits CD was released in 2000.\n\nAll band members still influence the genre they helped to create. The most notable is Queens of the Stone Age. Josh Homme, Nick Oliveri, and Alfredo Hernandez started this up after Josh had experimented with his famous Desert Sessions.\n\nJohn Garcia took a path geared more towards traditional rock. He opened with Slo Burn. It was a harder Kyuss, and still played in drop C. That project did not last for over a year, although one EP was released. Following Slo Burn came Unida. This band was steered toward rock n' roll and away from the stoner rock genre. John has most recently been involved with the band Hermano. Many consider this the greatest post-Kyuss project. In 2010 a Garcia Plays Kyuss gig at Roadburn Festival (Netherlands), to be followed by a proper European tour, was announced. The line-up of this band includes (former) members of Agua de Annique, Celestial Season, Kong and Arsenal.\n\nNick Oliveri also has created waves in the music world. Apart from playing for years in Queens of the Stone Age he has played on and off in The Dwarves. He is most known for his side project, which has become his full-time band, Mondo Generator.\n\nScott Reeder pursued a career of producing mainly (most notably Orange Goblin's Coup de Grace). In 2006, he released a solo album called Tunnelvision Brilliance. He also played in Unida for a little bit.\n\nBrant Bjork has the most stable musical career of them all. He turned down playing with Queens of the Stone Age to pursue a journey with his surfing buddies, Fu Manchu. He left after making numerous records with them to focus on his already blossoming solo career, playing the guitar instead of drums. He has worked with many people since, releasing records with Ché, touring as Brant Bjork and the Bros, and occasionally playing drums as well. Brant Bjork also played on some Desert Sessions.\n\nLos Angeles based drummer Gene Trautmann played for a brief period between Brant Bjork and Alfredo Hernandez.\n\nAlfredo Hernandez has guest starred on too many CDs and bands to count including Yawning Man, Orquestra Del Desierto, Fatso Jetson, and many others. He also played in a local band located in Palm Desert and is the drummer of Brant Bjork and the Bros.\n\nA big influence on the sound of Kyuss was Chris Goss (frontman of Masters of Reality), who produced Blues for the Red Sun, and everything that followed.\n\nAlthough Queens of the Stone Age has been, and continues to be, a great deal more popular than Kyuss or any of its offshoots for many Kyuss is considered far superior than anything the disbanded members created afterward.\n\nA lot of bands have been inspired by Kyuss, including Electric Wizard, Monster Magnet, Orange Goblin, Beaver, Dozer, Los Natas, Truckfighters, Acid King, Fu Manchu, Clutch, Pelican, Torche.\n\nFor 2011 touring line-up, see Kyuss Lives!. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kyuss\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Welcome to Sky Valley is the third studio album by American stoner rock/metal band Kyuss, originally released on June 28, 1994.\n\nKyuss was recorded in early 1993 and scheduled for release in January 1994. They sneak-previewed the completed album at Foundations Forum 93 and contributed the song \"Demon Cleaner\" to the sampler disc. Due to mild success from their previous album, Kyuss had been promoted from their subsidiary record label \"Dali\" to the main label \"Chameleon.\" On November 11, 1993 Chameleon Records abruptly shut down. Their joint-venture partner Elektra quickly picked up the band and scheduled the album for release in March 1994. The album was then delayed for another three months after that, eventually being released almost a year after being initially recorded.\n\nThis is the first Kyuss album to feature bassist Scott Reeder, who replaced Nick Oliveri in 1992. Welcome to Sky Valley was the last to feature founding member Brant Bjork. The song \"N.O.\" was originally recorded by Across The River, a band fronted by Mario Lalli and featuring bassist Reeder. After Reeder left The Obsessed and joined Kyuss, Bjork suggested they record \"N.O.\" as a tribute to Across The River.\n\nOn compact disc, Welcome to Sky Valley was originally released with its ten total songs contained in three tracks, with an additional, fourth hidden track. It was later re-released with all ten tracks separated individually. However, most commercially-sold versions of the compact disc contain the three tracks, a setup which is meant to encourage listeners to experience it as a full album instead of as a collection of separate songs. Guitarist Josh Homme claimed in an interview that the band \"just wanted it to be like hell to play on a CD player\". The album's liner notes instruct the listener to \"Listen without distraction\".\n\nThe band Tool covered \"Demon Cleaner\" during a 1998 show at the Hollywood Palladium, with bassist Reeder joining them onstage during the performance. The song is also contained in the video game Guitar Hero: Metallica.\n\nPersonnel\n    John Garcia - Vocals\n    Brant Bjork - Drums\n    Josh Homme - Guitars, Acoustic Guitar in \"Space Cadet\"\n    Scott Reeder - Bass\n\n\nTracklist\n    Movement I – 17:47 (Josh Homme, Brant Bjork)\n        \"Gardenia\" – 6:54\n        \"Asteroid\" – 4:49\n        \"Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop\" – 6:04\n\n    Movement II – 14:50 (Homme, Scott Reeder)\n        \"100°\" – 2:29\n        \"Space Cadet\" – 7:02\n        \"Demon Cleaner\" – 5:19\n\n    Movement III – 18:19 (Homme, Bjork, Reeder, Mario Lalli)\n        \"Odyssey\" – 4:19\n        \"Conan Troutman\" – 2:12\n        \"N.O.\" – 3:47\n        \"Whitewater\" – 8:00\n\n    \"Lick Doo\" – 0:57 (Hidden Track)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kyuss/Welcome+to+Sky+Valley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
