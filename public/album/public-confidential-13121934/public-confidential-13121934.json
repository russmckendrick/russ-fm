      "biography": "One of the earliest and most important ska revivalist groups, Birmingham's the Beat formed in 1978 (the band had to change its name to the English Beat in the U.S. to avoid confusion with Paul Collins' band of the same name). The multiracial band carved a distinct sound through the use of alternating lead vocals by guitarist Dave Wakeling and punk toaster/rapper Ranking Roger, supported by a tight band consisting of Andy Cox (guitar), David Steele (bass), and Everett Moreton (drums). The addition of 50-year-old saxophonist Saxa, who originally played with Prince Buster and Desmond Dekker, gave the band credibility and fleshed out its sound. An opening spot for the Selecter led to the band's signing to 2-Tone, where they released the hit single \"Tears of a Clown,\" a wonderful version of the Smokey Robinson classic. In 1980, the band decided to form its own 2-Tone-inspired label, Go-Feet (distributed by Arista). A string of hit singles followed in the U.K., including \"Mirror in the Bathroom.\" Their debut LP, I Just Can't Stop It, combined the early hits with other pop/ska-oriented material. \"Stand Down Margaret,\" with its anti-Thatcher stance, found the band moving in a more political direction, leading to several benefit gigs for \"radical\" causes. Musically, the Beat slowed down the tempo for a more traditional reggae sound showcased on 1981's Wha'ppen. This direction failed to bring the chart success of its predecessor. Featuring a more pop-oriented approach, 1982's Special Beat Service helped the band increase its U.S. fan base through MTV exposure of \"Save It for Later\" and \"I Confess,\" but the bandmembers decided to call it quits early the following year. Wakeling and Ranking Roger went on to form General Public, and Cox and Steele formed Fine Young Cannibals.",

      "biography": "Roger Charlery (21 February 1963 – 26 March 2019), known professionally as Ranking Roger, was a British musician. He was a vocalist in the 1980s two-tone band The Beat (known in North America as The English Beat) and later General Public. Later he headed up a reformed Beat lineup.\nThe \"Ranking\" moniker is short for \"top-ranking\" or \"high-ranking\", and is a boast typical of many MCs.\nRoger Charlery was born in Birmingham, England, and grew up in the Small Heath area of the city. The son of Jean Baptiste Charlery and his wife Anne Marie, he was of West Indian descent; his mother and father being from Saint Lucia. He attended Archbishop Williams school, and while still at school began deejaying with reggae sound systems before becoming a drummer with the Dum Dum Boys in 1978.\nRoger became a punk rock fan as a teenager and was the drummer in the Dum Dum Boys before joining ska revival pioneers The Beat in the late 1970s. The Dum Dum Boys‘ first gig was with The Beat and his burgeoning friendship with them meant he began to gatecrash their gigs, take the mic and start toasting. He had appeared on stage toasting and singing with them many times before officially joining the band. His energetic style and Jamaican-influenced vocals, paired with Dave Wakeling were crucial in distinguishing the band from the other second-wave ska bands. The Beat released three albums: the critically acclaimed and seminal I Just Can't Stop It (1980), Wha'ppen? (1981) and Special Beat Service (1982).\nIn 1981, Joe Strummer and Mick Jones of the Clash invited Roger to sing on a version of \"Rock the Casbah\" which was released in 2015.\nAfter The Beat's 1983 break-up, he and Wakeling formed General Public with former members of Dexys Midnight Runners and Horace Panter of the Specials. They released the album All the Rage, aided by the single \"Tenderness\". In 1986, they released Hand to Mouth which was less successful, and the band split up. In 1995, Roger and Wakeling reformed General Public with a new supporting band, and released the album Rub It Better. Roger and Wakeling also worked on various projects and reunited for the 1994 Threesome soundtrack, recording a cover of \"I'll Take You There\".\nRoger released Radical Departure, his first solo album, in 1988 which included band members Horace Panter and Fuzz Townshend. On 2001's Inside My Head, Roger pursued a more dance/electronic sound.\nIn the early 1990s, Roger joined members of the Specials to form the new band Special Beat which released two live albums. In 1996 he sang back-up and toasting on the new version of \"The Bed's Too Big Without You\" on Sting's \"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\" CD-Maxi single. The rock band Smash Mouth featured Roger on their song \"You Are My Number One\" in 2003.\nHe collaborated with Pato Banton in 1995 on \"Bubbling Hot\", which reached number 15 on the UK single charts.\nIn 2005, The Beat re-formed, with Roger and Everett Morton of the original line-up, with Roger's son, Ranking Junior also on vocals. Performing some new material, The Beat performed at Glastonbury the same year, where Roger was joined by Ranking Junior.\nRoger sang on \"Roxanne\" on stage with the Police on their 2007 world tour. He was a guest performer on Big Audio Dynamite's seventh album Higher Power in 1994 when the band were known as simply 'Big Audio'. He later became a member of Big Audio Dynamite for their final studio album Entering a New Ride (1997).\nRoger contributed to Walls Come Tumbling Down: The Music and Politics of Rock Against Racism, 2 Tone and Red Wedge, written by Daniel Rachel and published in 2016.\nRoger continued to lead The Beat and tours throughout Europe as well as works on solo projects. In his last years he released a series of new albums. 2013 saw the release of Retrospective, an album of solo work recorded over the 25 years since the break up of General Public, featuring various artists and producers including Sly & Robbie, and songs such as \"Bubbling Hot\" (the 1994 hit collaboration with Pato Banton) and a cover of \"The Bed's Too Big Without You\" (first recorded with Sting for the 1996 film The Truth About Cats & Dogs).\nLive in London was released in 2013 – a live recording of The Beat playing at 229 The Venue, featuring some of their greatest hits as well as new tracks by Roger and Ranking Junior.\n2014’s Pop Off the Head Top consisted of entirely new compositions, including additional vocals and song writing from Ranking Junior. They recorded tracks for this project with Hugh Harris from London, Dopegrinders from Brighton and Mr. Anonymous from Colorado. Other key tracks involved the Italian producer AleXannA whose version of “16 Tons” features vocals by Roger, Ranking Junior, and Roger’s daughter Saffren Murphy.\n“Rock the Casbah”, released in 2015 in collaboration with the charity Strummerville (founded by the friends and family of Joe Strummer to support aspiring musicians and projects that create social mobility through music). This five-track EP featured a previously unheard version of \"Rock The Casbah\", which Joe Strummer and Mick Jones of the Clash, had asked Roger to sing on back in 1981, re-recorded by the Brighton producers Dopegrinders, using the original stems donated by Mick Jones. The EP featured new tracks by Roger, Ranking Junior and Hugh Harris as well as a re-working of \"Muscle Ska\", co-written by Roger and Neville Staple from the Specials.\nIn September 2016, DMF released Bounce; the first new album by The Beat in 30 years. Written by Ranking Roger, Mick Lister and Ranking Junior, it was produced by Mick Lister and mixed by Tim Hamill and Mick Lister, with the exception of \"Side to Side\" and \"My Dream\", which were mixed by Dennis Bovell. The album was recorded in Roger's 'eco-friendly hideaway' – a round recording studio in his back garden, which he calls The Pod. The album received generally positive reviews with reviewers typically praising the band's 'passionately political edge' and pointing to how the album 'encompasses every aspect of one of the most musically diverse bands to come out of the multi-racial, multi-cultural explosion that made British pop music what it was in the 80’s'.\nThe band continues to tour and currently features Roger’s son Ranking Junior (real name Matthew Murphy), with drummers Oscar Harrison of Ocean Colour Scene and Fuzz Townshend of Pop Will Eat Itself. The line-up is completed by Chiko Hamilton on sax, bass guitarist Andy Pearson, guitarist Steve Harper and Bobby Bird of Higher Intelligence Agency.\nIn 2017, The Beat joined fellow 2-tone band the Selecter for a co-headline UK tour, Owing to demand, the tour was extended to cover other countries.\nIn early August 2018, Ranking Roger was hospitalised with a suspected mini-stroke. He recuperated at home, but cancelled planned live shows in the United Kingdom and United States. The band had just finished recording an album and Roger had written his autobiography, I Just Can't Stop It, scheduled for publication in mid 2019.\nRoger had five children, including son Ranking Junior (Matthew Murphy) and daughter Saffren who both featured with their father in a Beat revival band.\nIn January 2019 it was announced that Roger had undergone surgery for two brain tumours, and was undergoing treatment for lung cancer. He died at his home in Birmingham on 26 March 2019 at the age of 56.",
