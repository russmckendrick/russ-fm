      "biography": "The Smashing Pumpkins are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988. Formed by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, lead guitar) and James Iha (rhythm guitar), the band has included Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar), Melissa Auf der Maur (bass guitar), and currently includes Mike Byrne (drums), Nicole Fiorentino (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Jeff Schroeder (rhythm guitar) among its membership.\n\nDisavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, the Pumpkins have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, grunge, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze style production, and, in later recordings, electronica. Frontman Billy Corgan is the group's primary songwriter-his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\".\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 18.75 million albums sold in the United States, The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\n\nIn 2006, Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. The band toured with a rotating lineup of between five and nine musicians through much of 2007 and 2008 with new member Jeff Schroeder before Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. New drummer Mike Byrne and bassist Nicole Fiorentino solidified a new lineup with Corgan and Schroeder, toured through much of 2010 and 2011, and are currently recording the album Teargarden by Kaleidyscope and the album-within-an-album Oceania.",

      "editorial_notes": "Billed as the third instalment in a trilogy of albums comprised of 1995’s diamond-certified opus <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i> and 2000’s <i>Machina/The Machines of God</i>, <i>ATUM</i> can be described as a sonic amalgamation of the Pumpkins’ celebrated, if also complicated, history. It reinforces how few artists operate with the same level of ambition as Billy Corgan, who typically thrives in the challenge of writing grand statements. After all, he makes what sounds like a laborious effort—a 33-track conceptual piece split into three acts—look effortless. To Corgan, it’s practically second nature, but it’s worth noting that his idea to write a rock opera didn’t appear out of thin air.\n\nCorgan began to build the pieces of <i>ATUM</i> as far back as 2018, when he regained his footing by venturing into back-to-basics guitar rock (<i>SHINY AND OH SO BRIGHT, VOL. 1</i>) after welcoming guitarist James Iha back into the fold. Specifically, the intergalactic plotting of the track “Alienation”, which Corgan revealed via his podcast <i>Thirty-Three</i>—where he premiered new tracks while breaking down the album’s story in the lead-up to its official release—was a significant stepping-stone to dreaming up the album’s extensive lore. Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours, <i>ATUM</i> delivers a complex mix of dystopian themes, ranging from the dangers of technocracy and fatalism to the permissibility of suppressing free speech. Make of that what you will, but no one can deny that Corgan is very much in his element.\n\nWhile it’s not necessary to follow along with <i>ATUM</i>’s story—which traces the journey of a rock star named Shiny, who’s been exiled in space—it does enrich the experience. Or, at the very least, help make loose connections as to how Corgan confronts his own mythology head-on through the character. Easier to grasp, though, is its aural grandiosity, which makes an immediate impression on the lavish title track, a space-rock opener with a sci-fi bent featuring a piano accompaniment from frequent David Bowie collaborator Mike Garson. The use of vintage synths lingers throughout most of the album, adding a gothic flair to tracks like “With Ado I Do” and “Fireflies”, recalling the slinky electro-pop of 2020’s <i>CYR</i>. Similarly, the tautly arranged “Space Age” and “The Canary Trainer” evoke ’80s-inspired soft-rock ballads at their most resplendent.\n\nAnd then there’s the sprawling prog rock of “The Culling” and “Sojourner”, which, much to the chagrin of Pumpkins naysayers who’d rather hear them rock circa 1993, better resembles the classic AOR stylings of Styx. Still, there’s plenty of rock for them, too. While the sludgy and psychedelic “Empires” sounds like a modern reworking of anything off <i>Gish</i>, the stomping single “Beguiled” and “Beyond the Vale” give off a metallic sheen that’s more new wave of British heavy metal. Even the chugging “Harmageddon”, one of the heaviest tracks here, sees the band dive headfirst into pure thrash. There’s a self-awareness to his songwriting that adds to the album’s sad yet hopeful lightness, proving that his maximalist instincts cohere best when he’s genuinely having fun.",
