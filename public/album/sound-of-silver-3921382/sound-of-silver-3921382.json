      "biography": "LCD Soundsystem was an American-based dance-punk band from New York City. It was fronted by American singer-songwriter and producer James Murphy, co-founder of record label DFA Records. The group released three critically acclaimed albums, LCD Soundsystem, Sound of Silver and This Is Happening, with the last charting in the Billboard Top 10.\nOn February 5, 2011, a statement was posted on the band's website that announced its disbandment following a farewell concert, which took place on April 2, 2011, at Madison Square Garden. The farewell concert is chronicled in the documentary film Shut Up and Play the Hits. Their last televised performance was on February 14, 2011 on The Colbert Report.\nLCD Soundsystem gained attention with its first single, \"Losing My Edge\". Described as \"an eight-minute, laugh-out-loud funny dissection of cool over a dirty electronic beat\"; the single became an underground dance favorite. This was followed by other well received singles \"Give It Up\" and \"Yeah\".\nLCD Soundsystem released a double disc set simply titled LCD Soundsystem in February 2005 to critical acclaim. The first disc contains the album and the second contains re-releases of previous singles. The opening track \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\" quickly gained popularity and entered the UK Top 40 in March 2005 and was later featured on several video game soundtracks like SSX on Tour, Forza Motorsport 2, Burnout Revenge, and FIFA 06. The band toured with M.I.A.\nIn June 2005, the band covered a Siouxsie and the Banshees song, \"Slowdive\" for the B-side of \"Disco Infiltrator\".\nOn December 8, 2005 the group received nominations for two Grammy awards in the Electronica category for their self-titled album and in the Dance category for \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House.\" This album was also chosen as #94 of Amazon.com's \"Top 100 Editor's Picks\" of 2005.",

      "editorial_notes": "Halfway through the recording of his second album as LCD Soundsystem, James Murphy was, in his words, “suicidal”. Toiling alone in the same rural Massachusetts studio where he’d recorded LCD’s 2005 debut, Murphy covered the studio walls with silver fabric and aluminum foil. But it wasn’t able to block out his self-doubt: LCD may have made the thirty-something Murphy the unlikely figurehead of the early-2000s NYC dance-punk movement, but before that, he’d spent a decade trying to build a music career—and failing.\n\nHis solution came from an unlikely place: A commission from Nike to compose a single 45-minute piece of music for its <i>Original Run</i> series with iTunes. The fact that Murphy clearly wasn’t much of a runner didn’t play into the brand calculus. Nor did the fact that the resulting 45-minute, 33-second track—named “45:33”—was an overt nod to experimental icons like John Cage and Manuel Göttsching. Both were the kind of artists Murphy might have name-checked a few years earlier on his breakthrough debut single, “Losing My Edge”. But in creating a work that he felt could stand alongside these two underground heroes, Murphy seemed to cast off the meta-narrative of the uncool cool guy that had served as his calling card during LCD’s rise.\n\nMurphy’s Nike project would play a major role in LCD Soundsystem’s 2007 breakthrough, <i>Sound of Silver</i> (for starters, one of the album's highlights, “Someone Great”, began life as an instrumental segment of “45:33”). The album retains Murphy’s real-life-specific songwriting, and found him starting to move away from the wry self-referencing of the same New York scene the birthed LCD. “North American Scum” whisks its protagonist to Europe “where they go all night”. And the album's apex, “All My Friends”, finds Murphy admitting that he'd spent “the first five years trying to get with the plan”—and that he was now caught up in a professionalised party lifestyle—one in which the only things missing were actual friends.",
