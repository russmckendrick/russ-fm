      "biography": "Aerosmith was an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. The group consists of Steven Tyler (lead vocals), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also incorporated elements of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They are sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often known as the \"Toxic Twins\".\n\nPerry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith; in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their eponymous debut in 1973, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. The band broke into the mainstream with Toys in the Attic (1975) and Rocks (1976). Draw the Line and Night in the Ruts followed in 1977 and 1979. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit \"Sweet Emotion\" and the Top 10 hits \"Dream On\" and \"Walk This Way\". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". Drug addiction and internal conflict led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981. The band did not fare well and the album Rock in a Hard Place (1982) failed to match previous successes.\n\nPerry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984. After a comeback tour, they recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which did not meet commercial expectations. It was not until a 1986 collaboration with rap group Run-D.M.C. on a remake of \"Walk This Way\", and the 1987 multi-platinum release, Permanent Vacation, that they regained their previous level of popularity. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. Their biggest hits during this period included \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\", \"Angel\", \"Rag Doll\", \"Love in an Elevator\", \"Janie's Got a Gun\", \"What it Takes\", \"Livin' on the Edge\", \"Cryin'\", and \"Crazy\". The band also filmed popular music videos and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit with \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" from Armageddon's soundtrack and the following year, their roller coaster attraction opened at Walt Disney World. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. Additional albums Just Push Play (which included the hit \"Jaded\"), Honkin' on Bobo (a collection of blues covers), and Music from Another Dimension! followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. In 2008, they released Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. After five decades, the band continues to tour and record music. From 2019–2022, the band had a concert residency in Las Vegas, which was interrupted from 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 85 million records in the United States. With 25 gold, 18 platinum, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. They have achieved twenty-one Top 40 hits on the US Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were ranked number 57 and 30, respectively, on Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, Tyler and Perry were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2020, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: Aerosmith\n\nStudio albums\nAerosmith (1973)\nGet Your Wings (1974)\nToys in the Attic (1975)\nRocks (1976)\nDraw the Line (1977)\nNight in the Ruts (1979)\nRock in a Hard Place (1982)\nDone with Mirrors (1985)\nPermanent Vacation (1987)\nPump (1989)\nGet a Grip (1993)\nNine Lives (1997)\nJust Push Play (2001)\nHonkin' on Bobo (2004)\nMusic from Another Dimension!

The album was remastered and reissued in 2001.\n\nPump was widely acclaimed by both fans and critics upon its release. The album incorporates the use of keyboards and a horn section on many of the singles (\"Love in an Elevator\", \"The Other Side\"), and contains straightforward rockers (\"F.I.N.E.*\", \"Young Lust\"), the ballad \"What It Takes\", songs about issues such as incest and murder (\"Janie's Got a Gun\") and drug and alcohol abuse (\"Monkey on My Back\"), as well as a variety of instrumental interludes such as \"Hoodoo\" and \"Dulcimer Stomp.\"\n\nThe album has certified sales of seven million copies in the U.S. to date. It produced a variety of successes and \"firsts\" for the band including their first Grammy award (\"Janie's Got a Gun\"). \"Love in an Elevator\" became the first Aerosmith song to hit #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Additionally, it is the only Aerosmith album to date to have three Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and three #1 singles on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album was the fourth bestselling album of the year 1990.\n\nPump was the second of three sequentially recorded Aerosmith albums to feature producer Bruce Fairbairn and engineers Mike Frazer and Ken Lomas at The Little Mountain Sound Studios.\n\nAerosmith found themselves in law school textbooks after a small rock band named Pump sued Aerosmith's management company for service mark infringement. Aerosmith won the case. Aerosmith also found themselves in legal trouble when the songwriting team Holland-Dozier-Holland threatened to sue the band over the main melody in Aerosmith's song \"The Other Side\" which sounded similar to the melody in the song \"Standing in the Shadows of Love\". As part of the settlement, Aerosmith agreed to add \"Holland-Dozier-Holland\" in the songwriting credits for \"The Other Side\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith/Pump\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album incorporates the use of keyboards and a horn section on many of the singles (\"Love in an Elevator\", \"The Other Side\"), and contains straightforward rockers (\"F.I.N.E.*\", \"Young Lust\"), the ballad \"What It Takes\", songs about issues such as incest and murder (\"Janie's Got a Gun\") and drug and alcohol abuse (\"Monkey on My Back\"), as well as a variety of instrumental interludes such as \"Hoodoo\" and \"Dulcimer Stomp.\"\n\nThe album has certified sales of seven million copies in the U.S. to date. It produced a variety of successes and \"firsts\" for the band including their first Grammy award (\"Janie's Got a Gun\"). \"Love in an Elevator\" became the first Aerosmith song to hit #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Additionally, it is the only Aerosmith album to date to have three Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and three #1 singles on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album was the fourth bestselling album of the year 1990.\n\nPump was the second of three sequentially recorded Aerosmith albums to feature producer Bruce Fairbairn and engineers Mike Frazer and Ken Lomas at The Little Mountain Sound Studios.\n\nAerosmith found themselves in law school textbooks after a small rock band named Pump sued Aerosmith's management company for service mark infringement. Aerosmith won the case. Aerosmith also found themselves in legal trouble when the songwriting team Holland-Dozier-Holland threatened to sue the band over the main melody in Aerosmith's song \"The Other Side\" which sounded similar to the melody in the song \"Standing in the Shadows of Love\". As part of the settlement, Aerosmith agreed to add \"Holland-Dozier-Holland\" in the songwriting credits for \"The Other Side\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aerosmith/Pump\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
