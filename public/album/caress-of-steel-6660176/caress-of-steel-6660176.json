      "biography": "Rush were a Canadian rock band formed in 1968 in Toronto, that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their 1974 self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.\n\nRush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with Fly by Night (1975), 2112 (1976), A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984) and Counterparts (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.\n\nRush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.\n\nAs of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nRush (1974)\nFly by Night (1975)\nCaress of Steel (1975)\n2112 (1976)\nA Farewell to Kings (1977)\nHemispheres (1978)\nPermanent Waves (1980)\nMoving Pictures (1981)\nSignals (1982)\nGrace Under Pressure (1984)\nPower Windows (1985)\nHold Your Fire (1987)\nPresto (1989)\nRoll the Bones (1991)\nCounterparts (1993)\nTest for Echo (1996)\nVapor Trails (2002)\nSnakes & Arrows (2007)\nClockwork Angels (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Caress of Steel is the third studio album by Rush, released in 1975. The album shows more of Rush's adherence to the standards of progressive rock. Long pieces, pieces broken up into parts, and solo passages of speed and agility are all included. The album is often considered notable for the inclusion of the band's first epic piece, \"The Fountain Of Lamneth\", which runs to nearly 20 minutes and comprised the whole of side two of the original vinyl release. Intended to be Rush's breakthrough album, it sold fewer copies than their previous record and was considered a disappointment by their record company, with the tour becoming known as the \"Down The Tubes Tour\".\n\nDespite its relatively poor sales, the album charted higher in the US than Rush's previous release Fly by Night (as stated in the liner notes to Rush's The Spirit of Radio Greatest Hits 1974-87 album). The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1993. The next year's follow-up album, 2112 would pave the way for Rush's commercial success with its own 21-minute epic.\n\nOriginally, the album cover was supposed to be in silver hue to give it a \"steel\" appearance. A printing error resulted in a copper color for the album cover.\n\nSome cassette printings of this album had \"Didacts and Narpets\" and \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" switch places (possibly due to cassette tape length and to balance out both sides), and all of the movements of \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" were listed as separate songs.\n\n \n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, except where noted.\n\n\n Side one\n\"Bastille Day\" – 4:37 \n\"I Think I'm Going Bald\" – 3:37 \n\"Lakeside Park\" – 4:08 \n\"The Necromancer\" – 12:30 \n\"I. Into the Darkness\" – 4:12 \n\"II. Under the Shadow\" – 4:25 \n\"III. Return of the Prince\" – 3:52 \nSide two\n\"The Fountain of Lamneth\" – 19:58 \n\"I. In the Valley\" – 4:18 \n\"II. Didacts and Narpets\" – 1:00 \n\"III. No One at the Bridge\" – 4:19 \n\"IV. Panacea\" (music: Lee) – 3:14 \n\"V. Bacchus Plateau\" (music: Lee) – 3:16 \n\"VI. The Fountain\" – 3:49 \n\n\nBastille Day\nRush's Led Zeppelin influence is still prominent on this record, most obviously in the song \"Bastille Day\" (which discusses the storming of the Bastille in the French Revolution), though it is apparent on all three of the shorter songs on the album. \"Bastille Day\" reappeared on the \"R30\" CD and DVD as part of the instrumental R30 Overture.\n\nI Think I'm Going Bald\n\"I Think I'm Going Bald\" was written for Canadian rocker Kim Mitchell, who at the time was the frontman of the band Max Webster. It is also stated in the book \"Contents Under Pressure\", that the song \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" was written as an homage to KISS' \"Goin' Blind\".\n\n\nLakeside Park\nMentioned in the song \"Lakeside Park\", May 24 is Victoria Day, a Canadian holiday. Lakeside Park itself is a park in Port Dalhousie, St. Catharines, Ontario, where lyricist Neil Peart grew up and worked as a teenager during the summer.\n\n\nThe Necromancer\nA necromancer is one who practices necromancy, a type of divination involving the summoning of Operative Spirits to discern information about the future. \"The Necromancer\" starts with heavy influence from J.R.R. Tolkien's literary mythology. The Necromancer was a pseudonym used by Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings for the character Sauron. The song departs from the story of the book as Part III sees the return of By-Tor from Fly by Night, this time as a hero and not a villain. \"Return of the Prince\" was also released as a single in some countries.\n\nOn the inside gatefold of the album, just below the lyrics to \"The Necromancer\", the Latin phrase \"Terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus\" appears. This translates (loosely) to:\n\n\" The hour ends the day; the author ends his work\". \nThe Fountain of Lamneth\nThe final song on the album , \"The Fountain of Lamneth\", predates epics like \"2112\" and the Cygnus X-1 series, and is only 34 seconds shorter than \"2112\". It also forms a complete story, this one about a man in search of the Fountain of Lamneth, and chronicles the individual occurrences of his journey.\n Didacts and Narpets\nRegarding \"Didacts and Narpets\" (which consists mostly of a drum solo), in the October 1991 news release from the Rush Backstage Club, Neil Peart said: \"Okay, I may have answered this before, but if not, the shouted words in that song represent an argument between Our Hero and the Didacts and Narpets - teachers and parents. I honestly can't remember what the actual words were, but they took up opposite positions like: \"Work! Live! Earn! Give!\" and like that.\" A didact is a teacher, and \"narpet\" is an anagram of \"parent\". Credits\nGeddy Lee - bass guitar and vocals \nAlex Lifeson - 6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars, classical guitar, steel guitar \nNeil Peart - lyrics and percussion \n\nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1975 Pop Albums 113 \n\n\nA remaster was issued in 1997.\n\nThe tray has a picture of star with man painting with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left. All remasters from Rush through to Permanent Waves are like this. This is just like the cover art of Retrospective I. \nThe remaster adds the album's back cover and gatefold (which included band pictures and lyrics) to the packaging which was not included on original CD. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/Caress+of+Steel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
