  "biography": "Years in the making, PEEPING TOM, noise rock renaissance man Mike Patton's most accessible work since his days in Faith No More, is finally a reality. The 11-track opus, featuring a lengthy and incongruous cast of guest performers, is set for a May 30 release on Patton's own Ipecac Recordings label.\n\nIn keeping with the landmark 1960 psychological horror film that inspired its name, PEEPING TOM had its genesis as a modus operandi devoid of physical intimacy. Patton would write songs with a wishlist of theoretical collaborators in mind, then hope for a reply in the form of a finished track. \"It's an exotic way of working for someone accustomed to a band environment,\" Patton says. \"It was charming, really. None of the usual Animal House stuff. Instead of swapping spit and underwear, we were swapping files.\"\n\nLack of face-to-face interaction did not keep long-distance collaborators from turning in exceptional performances: Norah Jones' lascivious \"Sucker,\" Kool Keith's \"Getaway\" and Massive Attack's \"Kill The DJ\" are intense and passionate as anything a live band environment could have produced-despite the fact that Patton has still never met Jones or Keith. \"Plenty of people on the record are still complete strangers to me,\" he says.\n\nThe initial PEEPING TOM offering also includes contributions from Amon Tobin, Bebel Gilberto, DubTrio, Kid Koala, Dale Crover, Rahzel and several of Patton's Bay Area running buddies, such as Dan \"the Automator\" Nakamura, and Jel, Odd Nosdam and Dose One of hip hop collective anticon. The end result is an utterly unique multi-genre/multi-artist departure from Patton's more recent noisy output-one that would ultimately have to be classified as a pop record, alas a Mike Patton pop record, but a pop record nonetheless.\n\n\"I don't listen to the radio, but if I did, this is what I'd want it to sound like. This is my version of pop music. In a way, this is an exercise for me: taking all these things I've learned over the years and putting them into a pop format. I've worked with many people who have said to me, 'oh you have a pop record in you, eventually you'll find it,' and I always laughed at them. I guess I owe them an apology.\"\n\nThe first single from the self titled record will be “Mojo”. It is accompanied by a music video featuring appearances by Danny Devito, Mark Hoppus (blink 182), Rachel Hunter as well as song collaborators Dan the Automator and Rahzel. The video was created by buzzed about music video director Matt McDermitt.\n\nAs work on PEEPING TOM began some six years back and was interrupted to accommodate Patton's recording or touring work with Fantomas, Tomahawk, Lovage, General Patton vs. the X-ecutioners, Kaada/Patton, Rahzel and guest turns on Bjork and Massive Attack records, two feature film scores, his film acting debut in “Firecracker”, videogame voice work in “The Darkness” and an ultimately \"ridiculous\" major label flirtation, enough material has massed for a second and possibly third record. A PEEPING TOM tour is also in discussion, pending various collaborators' schedules.\n\nThe band will make their worldwide live debut on the Conan O’Brien show on May 26th.",

A fascinating constellation revolving around the hard core of Vincent Haenni and Gabriel Scotti has recently been observed: live scores for synthesized images and real time projections, soundscapes accompanying public readings by French actor Carlo Brandt , electro-dub performances, completed by an interactive website where the visitors can try their hands at the genre. Plus, of course, a first CD (ICare/Saturn Split/db32). And now, Liquid Sand, taking the listener to the borders of elegant and sensual downbeat music, where twelve new planets are unveiled. Visiting various musical styles (jazz, ambient, dub) as well as literary genres (from the Great French poets to a 1970s cookbook for the American housewife), Peeping Tom does not just sample the finest elements thereof. Like a giant cosmic reactor would turn sand into liquid, the duo amalgamates the components to an amazing degree of perfection. Yet, the result is never sterile, each of the twelve tracks being on the contrary a rich and welcoming biosphere. They now await your visit.

Peeping Tom are a Rock Ceilidh band, and the first Thursday of each month they hold a ceilidh at The Massey Ferguson Social Club.

      "biography_en": "Years in the making, PEEPING TOM, noise rock renaissance man Mike Patton's most accessible work since his days in Faith No More, is finally a reality. The 11-track opus, featuring a lengthy and incongruous cast of guest performers, is set for a May 30 release on Patton's own Ipecac Recordings label.\n\nIn keeping with the landmark 1960 psychological horror film that inspired its name, PEEPING TOM had its genesis as a modus operandi devoid of physical intimacy. Patton would write songs with a wishlist of theoretical collaborators in mind, then hope for a reply in the form of a finished track. \"It's an exotic way of working for someone accustomed to a band environment,\" Patton says. \"It was charming, really. None of the usual Animal House stuff. Instead of swapping spit and underwear, we were swapping files.\"\n\nLack of face-to-face interaction did not keep long-distance collaborators from turning in exceptional performances: Norah Jones' lascivious \"Sucker,\" Kool Keith's \"Getaway\" and Massive Attack's \"Kill The DJ\" are intense and passionate as anything a live band environment could have produced-despite the fact that Patton has still never met Jones or Keith. \"Plenty of people on the record are still complete strangers to me,\" he says.\n\nThe initial PEEPING TOM offering also includes contributions from Amon Tobin, Bebel Gilberto, DubTrio, Kid Koala, Dale Crover, Rahzel and several of Patton's Bay Area running buddies, such as Dan \"the Automator\" Nakamura, and Jel, Odd Nosdam and Dose One of hip hop collective anticon. The end result is an utterly unique multi-genre/multi-artist departure from Patton's more recent noisy output-one that would ultimately have to be classified as a pop record, alas a Mike Patton pop record, but a pop record nonetheless.\n\n\"I don't listen to the radio, but if I did, this is what I'd want it to sound like. This is my version of pop music. In a way, this is an exercise for me: taking all these things I've learned over the years and putting them into a pop format. I've worked with many people who have said to me, 'oh you have a pop record in you, eventually you'll find it,' and I always laughed at them. I guess I owe them an apology.\"\n\nThe first single from the self titled record will be “Mojo”. It is accompanied by a music video featuring appearances by Danny Devito, Mark Hoppus (blink 182), Rachel Hunter as well as song collaborators Dan the Automator and Rahzel. The video was created by buzzed about music video director Matt McDermitt.\n\nAs work on PEEPING TOM began some six years back and was interrupted to accommodate Patton's recording or touring work with Fantomas, Tomahawk, Lovage, General Patton vs. the X-ecutioners, Kaada/Patton, Rahzel and guest turns on Bjork and Massive Attack records, two feature film scores, his film acting debut in “Firecracker”, videogame voice work in “The Darkness” and an ultimately \"ridiculous\" major label flirtation, enough material has massed for a second and possibly third record. A PEEPING TOM tour is also in discussion, pending various collaborators' schedules.\n\nThe band will make their worldwide live debut on the Conan O’Brien show on May 26th.",

      "biography_fr": "Peeping Tom est un projet musical de Mike Patton. Ce dernier a commencé à composer pour Peeping Tom dès 2000 mais son travail a été souvent interrompu, notamment pour permettre à Patton de se consacrer à ses autres projets musicaux.\nLe premier album, éponyme, de Peeping Tom est constitué de titres composés et interprétés par Mike Patton (chant, claviers, guitares, basse, batterie, samples…) en collaboration avec de nombreux artistes, la plupart participant à un seul morceau : on peut citer Norah Jones, Kool Keith, Massive Attack. Peeping Tom est sorti le 30 mai 2006 sur le label de Patton, Ipecac Recordings.\nPeeping Tom est désormais un groupe se produisant sur scène. Leur première apparition publique a eu lieu le 26 mai 2006 au Late Night with Conan O'Brien, talk-show de la chaîne américaine NBC, lors duquel ils ont interprété le premier single tiré de l'album, Mojo. Leur premier concert a eu lieu le 14 juillet 2006 sur la scène du festival de Dour et a été suivi d'une courte tournée européenne, puis d'une tournée américaine en première partie de Gnarls Barkley puis de The Who.",

      "biography_en": "Years in the making, PEEPING TOM, noise rock renaissance man Mike Patton's most accessible work since his days in Faith No More, is finally a reality. The 11-track opus, featuring a lengthy and incongruous cast of guest performers, is set for a May 30 release on Patton's own Ipecac Recordings label.\n\nIn keeping with the landmark 1960 psychological horror film that inspired its name, PEEPING TOM had its genesis as a modus operandi devoid of physical intimacy. Patton would write songs with a wishlist of theoretical collaborators in mind, then hope for a reply in the form of a finished track. \"It's an exotic way of working for someone accustomed to a band environment,\" Patton says. \"It was charming, really. None of the usual Animal House stuff. Instead of swapping spit and underwear, we were swapping files.\"\n\nLack of face-to-face interaction did not keep long-distance collaborators from turning in exceptional performances: Norah Jones' lascivious \"Sucker,\" Kool Keith's \"Getaway\" and Massive Attack's \"Kill The DJ\" are intense and passionate as anything a live band environment could have produced-despite the fact that Patton has still never met Jones or Keith. \"Plenty of people on the record are still complete strangers to me,\" he says.\n\nThe initial PEEPING TOM offering also includes contributions from Amon Tobin, Bebel Gilberto, DubTrio, Kid Koala, Dale Crover, Rahzel and several of Patton's Bay Area running buddies, such as Dan \"the Automator\" Nakamura, and Jel, Odd Nosdam and Dose One of hip hop collective anticon. The end result is an utterly unique multi-genre/multi-artist departure from Patton's more recent noisy output-one that would ultimately have to be classified as a pop record, alas a Mike Patton pop record, but a pop record nonetheless.\n\n\"I don't listen to the radio, but if I did, this is what I'd want it to sound like. This is my version of pop music. In a way, this is an exercise for me: taking all these things I've learned over the years and putting them into a pop format. I've worked with many people who have said to me, 'oh you have a pop record in you, eventually you'll find it,' and I always laughed at them. I guess I owe them an apology.\"\n\nThe first single from the self titled record will be “Mojo”. It is accompanied by a music video featuring appearances by Danny Devito, Mark Hoppus (blink 182), Rachel Hunter as well as song collaborators Dan the Automator and Rahzel. The video was created by buzzed about music video director Matt McDermitt.\n\nAs work on PEEPING TOM began some six years back and was interrupted to accommodate Patton's recording or touring work with Fantomas, Tomahawk, Lovage, General Patton vs. the X-ecutioners, Kaada/Patton, Rahzel and guest turns on Bjork and Massive Attack records, two feature film scores, his film acting debut in “Firecracker”, videogame voice work in “The Darkness” and an ultimately \"ridiculous\" major label flirtation, enough material has massed for a second and possibly third record. A PEEPING TOM tour is also in discussion, pending various collaborators' schedules.\n\nThe band will make their worldwide live debut on the Conan O’Brien show on May 26th.",

      "biography_fr": "Peeping Tom est un projet musical de Mike Patton. Ce dernier a commencé à composer pour Peeping Tom dès 2000 mais son travail a été souvent interrompu, notamment pour permettre à Patton de se consacrer à ses autres projets musicaux.\nLe premier album, éponyme, de Peeping Tom est constitué de titres composés et interprétés par Mike Patton (chant, claviers, guitares, basse, batterie, samples…) en collaboration avec de nombreux artistes, la plupart participant à un seul morceau : on peut citer Norah Jones, Kool Keith, Massive Attack. Peeping Tom est sorti le 30 mai 2006 sur le label de Patton, Ipecac Recordings.\nPeeping Tom est désormais un groupe se produisant sur scène. Leur première apparition publique a eu lieu le 26 mai 2006 au Late Night with Conan O'Brien, talk-show de la chaîne américaine NBC, lors duquel ils ont interprété le premier single tiré de l'album, Mojo. Leur premier concert a eu lieu le 14 juillet 2006 sur la scène du festival de Dour et a été suivi d'une courte tournée européenne, puis d'une tournée américaine en première partie de Gnarls Barkley puis de The Who.",
