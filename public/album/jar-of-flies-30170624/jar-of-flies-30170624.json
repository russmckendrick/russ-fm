      "biography": "Alice in Chains (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987 by guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who later recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley.Starr was replaced by Mike Inez in 1993. William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who died in 2002. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains.\n\nOften associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains' sound incorporates heavy metal elements. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band.\n\nAlice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They achieved success during the era with the albums Facelift (1990), Dirt (1992), Alice in Chains (1995), as well as the EP Jar of Flies (1994). Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward, due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band toured in 2006, with DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up have released the albums Black Gives Way to Blue (2009), The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here (2013), and Rainier Fog (2018).\n\nAlice in Chains have sold over 30 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone. The band has had 18 Top 10 songs on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No. 1 hits, and received 11 Grammy Award nominations. The band was ranked number 34 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and was ranked as the 15th greatest live band by Hit Parader. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released six studio albums, three EPs, three live albums, four compilations, two DVDs, 43 music videos, and 32 singles.",

It is the first EP in music history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 Chart and was well-received by critics.\nAccording to Staley, the title for the album came from a science experiment Cantrell conducted in third grade: \"They gave him two jars full of flies. One of the jars they overfed, the other jar they underfed. The one they overfed flourished for a while, then all the flies died from overpopulation. The one they underfed had most of the flies survive all year. I guess there's a message in there somewhere. Evidently that experiment had a big impact on Jerry.\"\nJar of Flies included the singles \"No Excuses\" and \"I Stay Away\", both of which had accompanying music videos. \"No Excuses\", which was a number one single on the Mainstream Rock charts, was Alice in Chains' most successful radio song until 2009. The second single, \"I Stay Away\", reached number ten on the Mainstream Rock charts, while the final single \"Don't Follow\", reached number 25. The final single released from the EP was a bold offering for a grunge-oriented band; a promo of the string instrumental \"Whale & Wasp\" was released as a promo-only single in January 1995. \"I Stay Away\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1995. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains/Jar+of+Flies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
