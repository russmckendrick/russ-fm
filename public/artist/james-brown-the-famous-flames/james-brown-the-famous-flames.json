  "biography": "James Brown & The Famous Flames was an American rhythm and blues, soul vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown first began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first appearance in a professional recording, \"Please, Please, Please\", in 1956.\n\nOn hit songs such as \"Try Me\", \"Bewildered\", \"Think\", \"I Don't Mind\", and \"I'll Go Crazy\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned singing, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show[2] (1964) and Ski Party.[3] Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown.[4] On their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, they are described as \"a group of singers, performers and dancers that created the complementary elements of one of the greatest stage shows of all time.\"[5] As of 2020, The Famous Flames were also inducted into The National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Famous Flames is sometimes erroneously identified as James Brown's \"band\",[8] a confusion partly fostered by their record companies' inconsistent labeling credit practices. Although members of the group did play instruments in some of their earliest shows and recordings, by 1959 Brown had hired a touring band and from that point on, the Flames contributed primarily as backing vocalists and dancers.[9] The band was billed separately as the James Brown Band, and later as the James Brown Orchestra. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown+&+The+Famous+Flames\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group played gospel and rhythm & blues, playing at juke joints, and later when they became better known, they performed at various colleges. \r\n\r\nPrior to their first recording, \"Please, Please, Please\", The Famous Flames were billed simply as The Flames, and Brown himself was billed as a member of the group. In later concerts and recordings Brown and the group were billed as James Brown and The Famous Flames, or sometimes as James Brown and His Famous Flames.\r\n\r\nDuring the earliest phase of the Flames' career, before they had a recording contract, each member of the group played an instrument; Bobby Byrd played the piano, while Brown himself played drums. However, in later years (aside from the brief exception of guitarist Nafloyd Scott) The Famous Flames consisted specifically of the singers who backed Brown, not the instrumentalists in his band.

Brown and the Flames' record label King Records contributed to the confusion on this point by crediting the vocal group on the printed labels of James Brown singles such as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" that did not actually feature them.\r\n\r\nEarly line-up, previously known as the Dominions ([a=Little Richard]'s backing vocalists) - 1957-1958: J.W.

      "bio_content": "James Brown & The Famous Flames was an American rhythm and blues, soul vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown first began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first appearance in a professional recording, \"Please, Please, Please\", in 1956.\n\nOn hit songs such as \"Try Me\", \"Bewildered\", \"Think\", \"I Don't Mind\", and \"I'll Go Crazy\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned singing, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show[2] (1964) and Ski Party.[3] Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown.[4] On their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, they are described as \"a group of singers, performers and dancers that created the complementary elements of one of the greatest stage shows of all time.\"[5] As of 2020, The Famous Flames were also inducted into The National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Famous Flames is sometimes erroneously identified as James Brown's \"band\",[8] a confusion partly fostered by their record companies' inconsistent labeling credit practices. Although members of the group did play instruments in some of their earliest shows and recordings, by 1959 Brown had hired a touring band and from that point on, the Flames contributed primarily as backing vocalists and dancers.[9] The band was billed separately as the James Brown Band, and later as the James Brown Orchestra. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown+&+The+Famous+Flames\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
