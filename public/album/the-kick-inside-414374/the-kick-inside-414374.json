      "biography": "Catherine Bush, professionally known as Kate Bush, is an English singer, songwriter, musician, dancer and record producer. In 1978, aged 19, she topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single \"Wuthering Heights\", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a self-written song. Bush has since released 25 UK Top 40 singles, including the Top 10 hits \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\", \"Babooshka\", \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\", \"Don't Give Up\" (a duet with Peter Gabriel) and \"King of the Mountain\". All 10 of her studio albums reached the UK Top 10, including the UK number one albums Never for Ever (1980), Hounds of Love (1985) and the compilation The Whole Story (1986). She was the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist to enter the album chart at number one.\n\nBush began writing songs at 11. She was signed to EMI Records after Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour helped produce a demo tape. Her debut album, The Kick Inside, was released in 1978. Bush slowly gained artistic independence in album production and has produced all her studio albums since The Dreaming (1982). She took a hiatus between her seventh and eighth albums, The Red Shoes (1993) and Aerial (2005). Bush drew attention again in 2014 with her concert residency Before the Dawn, her first show since 1979's The Tour of Life.\n\nThe TV series \"Stranger Things\" used Bush's \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\" in Season 4.  As a result of the resurgence of interest, in 2022 the song reached #1 on the UK charts, 37 years after its initial release, and generated 100s of millions of streams.\n\nBush's eclectic and experimental musical style, unconventional lyrics, performances, and literary themes have influenced a diverse range of artists. She has been nominated for 13 British Phonographic Industry accolades, winning for Best British Female Artist in 1987, and has been nominated for three Grammy Awards. In 2002, Bush was recognized with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Bush was appointed a CBE in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music. She was nominated three times for induction in the 2018, 2021, and 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At age 19, she spent four weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles chart with her debut single, “Wuthering Heights”—making her the first female artist ever to top the UK charts with a song she wrote completely by herself. As the title implies, the lyrics were a literary tour de force: Bush wrote the song from the perspective of Catherine, the protagonist of Emily Brontë’s novel of the same name, as she visits her beloved Heathcliff from the afterlife.\n\nWith its marriage of delicate piano and Bush’s siren-like vocals, “Wuthering Heights” was also a blueprint for her 1978 debut album, <i>The Kick Inside</i>. Comprising songs she had amassed for years—the soaring, orchestrated “The Man with the Child in His Eyes” and aptly named “The Saxophone Song” were even on her 1975 demo, which was produced by Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour—the album is elegant and wise, suffused with gratitude and gorgeous music.\n\nBush worked with session musicians who had worked with groups such as Pilot, The Alan Parsons Project and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel to craft theatrical rock (“James and the Cold Gun”), prog with a jazzy bent (“Strange Phenomena”) and baroque-pop (the synth-driven “Oh to Be in Love”). Lyrically, Bush drew on her own life for perceptive, heartfelt lyrics; notably, “Moving” was inspired by classes she took from mime artist Lindsay Kemp, while “The Man with the Child in His Eyes” is about a relationship with an older man who hasn’t lost his innocence. <i>The Kick Inside</i> made Bush an instant star and, today, it’s considered one of the most striking debut albums of all time—a testament to the power of nurturing original voices.",
