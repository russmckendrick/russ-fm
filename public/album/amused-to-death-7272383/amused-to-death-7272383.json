      "biography": "George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and composer. He was a founder member of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd, serving as bassist and co-lead vocalist. Following the departure of bandmate Syd Barrett in 1968, Waters became the band's lyricist, principal songwriter and conceptual leader. The band subsequently achieved international success in the 1970s with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall. Although Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the bass guitar, he also experimented with synthesisers and tape loops and played rhythm guitar on recordings and in concerts. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the remaining members over their intended use of the group's name and material. They settled the dispute out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years had passed before he performed with Pink Floyd again. The group have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States as of 2012.\nWaters' solo career has included three studio albums: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984), Radio K.A.O.S. (1987) and Amused to Death (1992). In 1986, he contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated film When the Wind Blows based on the Raymond Briggs' book of the same name. In 1990, he staged one of the largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, The Wall – Live in Berlin, with an official attendance of 200,000. In 1996, he was inducted into the US and the UK Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008. In 2005, he released Ça Ira, an opera in three acts translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto based on the French Revolution. On 2 July 2005, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Nick Mason, Richard Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event; it was the group's first appearance with Waters in 24 years.\nIn 2010, he began The Wall Live, a worldwide tour that features a complete performance of The Wall. During this tour, at The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters, Gilmour performing \"Comfortably Numb\", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for \"Outside the Wall\". Waters' tour topped international concert ticket sales for the first half of 2012, selling more than 1.4 million tickets globally.\nFour times married, he is the father of three children. In 2004, he became engaged to actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning; the couple married in 2012.",

            "content": "Amused to Death is a concept album, and the third studio album by former Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters. It was released in 1992.\n\nThe album title was attached to material that Waters began working on during the Radio KAOS tour. A prototype album cover was reportedly distributed to his record company, which included caricatures of three figures resembling David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright, floating in a martini glass. However, it was several years before the album was finally released (Roger refused to release it as long as his former bandmates were still on Columbia Records' roster), and it is unknown how much the material was changed in the interim. At the very least, the songs criticising the first Gulf War, President Bush, and Tiananmen Square were new or heavily rewritten, as those events occurred after the original writing.\n\nIn Neil Postman's book The End of Education, he remarks on the album: \"(...) Roger Waters, once the lead singer of Pink Floyd, was sufficiently inspired by a book of mine to produce a CD called Amused to Death. This fact so elevated my prestige among undergraduates that I am hardly in a position to repudiate him or his kind of music.\"\n\nWaters stated in an interview with Rockline on 8 February 1993 that he wanted to use samples of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey on the album. Stanley Kubrick, the director, turned him down on the basis that it would open the door to many other people using the sound sample. He has since then used audio of HAL describing his mind being taken away when performing the song live (as an intro, specifically during his In the Flesh concert tour, after Kubrick's death).\n\nBBC Radio 1 refused to play \"What God Wants\", on the album, due to its lyrical content, outraging Waters. Two other singles besides \"What God Wants\", \"Three Wishes\" and \"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\" (also on the album), were released in Europe. These two singles (as well as a video for \"Three Wishes\") were slated for release in the US but were eventually canceled. \n\nAmused to Death further explores Waters' disillusionment with modern Western society, focusing specifically on the influence of television and the mass media. The album was inspired by the book Amusing Ourselves to Death, a critique of television and its related culture by Neil Postman. Continuing Waters' trend of having well known guest guitarists featured on his solo albums, Amused to Death features Jeff Beck on lead guitar.\n\nLike every studio album Roger Waters has recorded since The Dark Side of the Moon, Amused to Death is a concept album. This one is organized loosely around the idea of a monkey randomly switching channels on a television, but explores numerous political and social themes, including critiques of the First Gulf War in \"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\" and \"Perfect Sense\".\n\nThe first song, \"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\", features a sample of World War I veteran Alfred \"Alf\" Razzell, a member of the Royal Fusiliers (much like Waters' father Eric Fletcher Waters had been in the following war) who describes his account of finding fellow soldier William \"Bill\" Hubbard, to whom the album is dedicated, severely wounded on the battlefield. After failed attempts to take him to safety, Razzell is forced to abandon him in no-man's land. This sample is continued at the end of the title track, at the very end of the album, providing a more upbeat coda to the tragic story.\n\nThe second song, \"What God Wants, Part I\", follows and contrasts the moving words of Razzell by opening with the TV being tuned instead into an excerpt that sounds like it's taken from a vox pop of a child who says, \"I don't mind about the war. That's one of the things I like to watch, if it's a war going on. Cos then I know if, um, our side's winning, if our side's losing…\" he is then interrupted by the channel change and a burst of ape-chatter.\n\nThe third song, \"Perfect Sense, Part I\", begins with a loud, unintelligible rant, and after that one can hear backwards-uttered words scattered about for the first two minutes of the song. Played on reverse, this message tells that Roger has decided to record a backwards message. \"Julia, however, in the light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we changed our minds.

      "wiki_content": "Amused to Death is a concept album, and the third studio album by former Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters. It was released in 1992.\n\nThe album title was attached to material that Waters began working on during the Radio KAOS tour. A prototype album cover was reportedly distributed to his record company, which included caricatures of three figures resembling David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright, floating in a martini glass. However, it was several years before the album was finally released (Roger refused to release it as long as his former bandmates were still on Columbia Records' roster), and it is unknown how much the material was changed in the interim. At the very least, the songs criticising the first Gulf War, President Bush, and Tiananmen Square were new or heavily rewritten, as those events occurred after the original writing.\n\nIn Neil Postman's book The End of Education, he remarks on the album: \"(...) Roger Waters, once the lead singer of Pink Floyd, was sufficiently inspired by a book of mine to produce a CD called Amused to Death. This fact so elevated my prestige among undergraduates that I am hardly in a position to repudiate him or his kind of music.\"\n\nWaters stated in an interview with Rockline on 8 February 1993 that he wanted to use samples of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey on the album. Stanley Kubrick, the director, turned him down on the basis that it would open the door to many other people using the sound sample. He has since then used audio of HAL describing his mind being taken away when performing the song live (as an intro, specifically during his In the Flesh concert tour, after Kubrick's death).\n\nBBC Radio 1 refused to play \"What God Wants\", on the album, due to its lyrical content, outraging Waters. Two other singles besides \"What God Wants\", \"Three Wishes\" and \"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\" (also on the album), were released in Europe. These two singles (as well as a video for \"Three Wishes\") were slated for release in the US but were eventually canceled. \n\nAmused to Death further explores Waters' disillusionment with modern Western society, focusing specifically on the influence of television and the mass media. The album was inspired by the book Amusing Ourselves to Death, a critique of television and its related culture by Neil Postman. Continuing Waters' trend of having well known guest guitarists featured on his solo albums, Amused to Death features Jeff Beck on lead guitar.\n\nLike every studio album Roger Waters has recorded since The Dark Side of the Moon, Amused to Death is a concept album. This one is organized loosely around the idea of a monkey randomly switching channels on a television, but explores numerous political and social themes, including critiques of the First Gulf War in \"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\" and \"Perfect Sense\".\n\nThe first song, \"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\", features a sample of World War I veteran Alfred \"Alf\" Razzell, a member of the Royal Fusiliers (much like Waters' father Eric Fletcher Waters had been in the following war) who describes his account of finding fellow soldier William \"Bill\" Hubbard, to whom the album is dedicated, severely wounded on the battlefield. After failed attempts to take him to safety, Razzell is forced to abandon him in no-man's land. This sample is continued at the end of the title track, at the very end of the album, providing a more upbeat coda to the tragic story.\n\nThe second song, \"What God Wants, Part I\", follows and contrasts the moving words of Razzell by opening with the TV being tuned instead into an excerpt that sounds like it's taken from a vox pop of a child who says, \"I don't mind about the war. That's one of the things I like to watch, if it's a war going on. Cos then I know if, um, our side's winning, if our side's losing…\" he is then interrupted by the channel change and a burst of ape-chatter.\n\nThe third song, \"Perfect Sense, Part I\", begins with a loud, unintelligible rant, and after that one can hear backwards-uttered words scattered about for the first two minutes of the song. Played on reverse, this message tells that Roger has decided to record a backwards message. \"Julia, however, in the light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message. Stanley, for you, and for all the other book burners.\" The message climaxes with Waters yelling in the aggressive Scottish voice he used to depict the character of the teacher in The Wall.\n\nIn \"Perfect Sense, Part II\", famed sportscaster Marv Albert narrates a war as if it were a basketball game, and a massive choir sings their \"global anthem\":\n\n    Can't you see\n    It all makes perfect sense\n    Expressed in dollars and cents\n    Pounds, shillings, and pence\n\nIn \"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\", Waters sings, \"I looked over Jordan and what did I see. Saw a U.S. Marine in a pile of debris\", which echoes his similar line in \"Sheep\" from Pink Floyd's Animals (1977): \"I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen things are not what they seem.\"\n\n\"Too Much Rope\" ending consists of fading guitar section, near the end of which the four-note theme from \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond Part II\" can be heard.\n\nAt the beginning of \"What God Wants, Part II\", Charles Fleischer (better known as the voice of Roger Rabbit) performs the greedy evangelist's sermon.\n\nThe song \"Watching TV\" (a duet with Don Henley) explores the influence of mass media on the Chinese protests for democracy in Tiananmen Square.\n\nWaters adds a reference to Andrew Lloyd Webber in the song \"It's a Miracle\":\n\n    We cower in our shelters, with our hands over our ears\n    Lloyd Webber's awful stuff runs for years and years and years\n    An earthquake hits the theatre, but the operetta lingers\n    Then the piano lid comes down and breaks his fucking fingers\n    It's a miracle\n\nWaters asserted that Webber had plagiarized music from Pink Floyd's \"Echoes\" for sections of the musical The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nThe concluding, title track \"Amused to Death\" features a sample from the 1977 low-budget zombie film Shock Waves in which the films characters wrestle over a flashlight, and begins with the lyric, \"Doctor, Doctor.\" \"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\" on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the first song written by Roger, opens with the same line.\n\nThe album is mixed in QSound to enhance the spatial feel of the audio, and the many sound effects on the album — rifle range ambience, sleigh-bells, cars, planes, distant horses, chirping crickets, and dogs — all make use of the 3-D facility. A limited \"MasterSound\" edition was also released.\n\nAmused to Death reached #8 on the UK Albums Chart, Waters' first Top 10 in his homeland, and a career high of #21 on the Billboard 200, aided by \"What God Wants, Part I\", which hit #4 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1992.
