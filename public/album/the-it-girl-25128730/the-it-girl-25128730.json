      "biography": "There are five artists with this name:\n1. A popular British alternative band active from 1993 to 1998\n2. An active dubstep/techno producer from Coventry, England\n3. An experimental hip-hop musician\n4. A garage rock band from Oklahoma formed in 2008.\n5. 90s emo / post hardcore band from Staten Island, NY. Later changed their name to Serpico after getting paid off by the English band.\n\n1. Sleeper was a Britpop group which formed in 1993 in Manchester, England. The band consisted of Louise Wener (vocals, guitar), Jon Stewart (guitar), Diid Osman (bass) and Andy Maclure (drums). The band released three albums -  Smart, The It Girl and Pleased to Meet You - and split in 1998.\n\nTheir breakthrough song, Inbetweener, featured a memorable video with Dale Winton, who was a popular icon among students at the time.  Sleeper also recorded a cover version of the Blondie song Atomic, which was used as a track in the film Trainspotting. Their version was quite well-received and the only criticism is that it was too similar to the original.\n\nThe It Girl was arguably their finest moment with Lie Detector, Sale of the Century and Statuesque as the defining tracks. It was produced by Stephen Street then famous for his contributions to The Smiths, Morrissey and Blur. It captured the imagination of the Britpop era. Wener admits that they were basically hanging onto the coattails of the bigger bands including the likes of Blur and Oasis.\n\nThe original band name for the band was Surrender Dorothy. They took that name from the smoke trail telling Dorothy to surrender in the Wizard of Oz movie. \nAfter the band's split Louise Wener went on to have a successful career as a novelist.\n\nThe band was the inspiration for the phrase \"Sleeperbloke\", referring to the disparity between the glamorous singer Wener and the other frequently ignored members of the band (who tended to be far more anonymous and stood at the back). The term is still used by music press journalists and musicians, to refer to any person of limited standing within a band or an especially drab and unremarkable individual. Sleeper were said to be amused by the term and even produced an ironic \"Sleeperbloke\" T-shirt which sold well\n\nThe real-life Sleeperblokes were:\n\nJon Stewart (born Jonathan David Stewart, 12 September 1967 in Sheffield) — (guitarist) \nDiid Osman (b.

His work, both as an accomplished musician, and as a respected tattoo and visual artist balances a breadth of spirit with worldly, emotional depth.
