  "biography": "Skunk Anansie are an English rock band whose members include Skin (born Deborah Dyer, 3 August 1967, Brixton), Cass (born Richard Keith Lewis, 1 September 1960, London), Ace (born Martin Ivor Kent, 30 March 1967, Cheltenham) and Mark Richardson (born 28 May 1970, Leeds).\n\nSkunk Anansie formed in March 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name \"Skunk Anansie\" is taken from the West African folk tales of Anansi the spider-man, with \"Skunk\" added to \"make the name nastier\". They are often grouped as part of a Britrock movement, running alongside Britpop. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 141 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. When the book first published this annual top 500 list in 2000, it only involved weeks spent on the singles chart until 2004's 17th edition, meaning the band's highest ranking has not been notified in any of the past editions. Their longest running release is 1996's Stoosh album with 55 weeks and a peak of No. 9. The band released their fifth studio album Wonderlustre (their first studio album after their reformation) internationally on 13 September 2010, preceded in August by its first single \"My Ugly Boy\".\n\nOn June 11, 2012, Skunk Anansie announced their new studio album titled 'Black Traffic' which they will be releasing in September 2012, via their own label working in partnership with 100% Records. The announcement follows what has been a hugely successful return for the band, who regrouped in 2009 following an eight- year hiatus.",

The name \"Skunk Anansie\" is taken from Akan folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with \"Skunk\" added to \"make the name nastier\".\\n\\nThey have released six studio albums: Paranoid & Sunburnt (1995), Stoosh (1996), Post Orgasmic Chill (1999), Wonderlustre (2010), Black Traffic (2012) and Anarchytecture (2016); one compilation album, Smashes and Trashes (2009); and several hit singles, including \"Charity\", \"Hedonism\", \"Selling Jesus\" and \"Weak\".\\n\\nThey are often grouped as part of the Britrock movement, as opposed to the contemporary Britpop of their early years due to their overall harder sound. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 142 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. Skunk Anansie have sold 5 million records.\\n\\nFormation and early career: 1994–2001\\nThe group played its first gig at London\\'s Splash club in March 1994.[1] In 1995 they were voted Best New British Band by the readers of Kerrang! magazine. At the award ceremony that year drummer Mark Richardson met the band who were looking for a permanent replacement for Robbie France, so an audition was set up and the band was reformed. Soon after that, two of their songs, \"Feed\" and \"Selling Jesus\", appeared on the soundtrack of the film Strange Days in 1995. \"Selling Jesus\" became Skunk Anansie\\'s controversial second song to receive radio play, following their first radio release \"Little Baby Swastikkka\".[13] After hearing this song, radio personality Howard Stern claimed that the band would become a huge hit.

      "biography_en": "Skunk Anansie are an English rock band whose members include Skin (born Deborah Dyer, 3 August 1967, Brixton), Cass (born Richard Keith Lewis, 1 September 1960, London), Ace (born Martin Ivor Kent, 30 March 1967, Cheltenham) and Mark Richardson (born 28 May 1970, Leeds).\n\nSkunk Anansie formed in March 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name \"Skunk Anansie\" is taken from the West African folk tales of Anansi the spider-man, with \"Skunk\" added to \"make the name nastier\". They are often grouped as part of a Britrock movement, running alongside Britpop. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 141 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. When the book first published this annual top 500 list in 2000, it only involved weeks spent on the singles chart until 2004's 17th edition, meaning the band's highest ranking has not been notified in any of the past editions. Their longest running release is 1996's Stoosh album with 55 weeks and a peak of No. 9. The band released their fifth studio album Wonderlustre (their first studio album after their reformation) internationally on 13 September 2010, preceded in August by its first single \"My Ugly Boy\".\n\nOn June 11, 2012, Skunk Anansie announced their new studio album titled 'Black Traffic' which they will be releasing in September 2012, via their own label working in partnership with 100% Records. The announcement follows what has been a hugely successful return for the band, who regrouped in 2009 following an eight- year hiatus.",

      "bio_content": "Skunk Anansie is a British rock band whose members include Skin (lead vocals, guitar), Cass (bass, guitar, backing vocals), Ace (guitar, backing vocals) and Mark Richardson (drums and percussion).\n\nSkunk Anansie formed in 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name \"Skunk Anansie\" is taken from Akan folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with \"Skunk\" added to \"make the name nastier\".\n\nThey have released six studio albums: Paranoid & Sunburnt (1995), Stoosh (1996), Post Orgasmic Chill (1999), Wonderlustre (2010), Black Traffic (2012) and Anarchytecture (2016); one compilation album, Smashes and Trashes (2009); and several hit singles, including \"Charity\", \"Hedonism\", \"Selling Jesus\" and \"Weak\".\n\nThey are often grouped as part of the Britrock movement, as opposed to the contemporary Britpop of their early years due to their overall harder sound. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 142 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. Skunk Anansie have sold 5 million records.\n\nFormation and early career: 1994–2001\nThe group played its first gig at London's Splash club in March 1994.[1] In 1995 they were voted Best New British Band by the readers of Kerrang! magazine. At the award ceremony that year drummer Mark Richardson met the band who were looking for a permanent replacement for Robbie France, so an audition was set up and the band was reformed. Soon after that, two of their songs, \"Feed\" and \"Selling Jesus\", appeared on the soundtrack of the film Strange Days in 1995. \"Selling Jesus\" became Skunk Anansie's controversial second song to receive radio play, following their first radio release \"Little Baby Swastikkka\".[13] After hearing this song, radio personality Howard Stern claimed that the band would become a huge hit. Success continued for the band and they were also voted Kerrang!'s Best British Live Act in 1996. In 1997 they were nominated for Best Live Act and Best Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nThe group played its first gig at London's Splash club in March 1994, subsequently taking six weeks to record its debut album, Paranoid & Sunburnt,[13] with producer Sylvia Massy at a \"haunted house\" outside the city. The band's first single, \"Selling Jesus,\" was featured on the soundtrack of the film Strange Days; Stoosh followed in 1996.[13] Both albums were released by One Little Indian Records.[13] After switching to the Virgin label in 1998, their third album, Post Orgasmic Chill, was released in 1999.\n\nIn 1996, the band played a set at the Coppid Beech Hotel, Bracknell during a record label event.\n\nIn 1999, the band was the last band of the 20th Century to headline Glastonbury Festival; closing the Pyramid Stage on Sunday 27 June.[14]\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the group toured globally with such bands as U2, Aerosmith, Feeder, Lenny Kravitz, Bad Religion, Rollins Band, Therapy?, Rammstein, Killing Joke, Soulfly, Sevendust, Oomph!, Muse, Staind, Powerman 5000, Veruca Salt, Marion and A Perfect Circle.\n\nDespite becoming one of the largest British acts of the 1990s and having much success throughout Europe, Skunk Anansie did not receive as much success in the U.S. However, they did have several concerts in the U.S., with their first being in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2001 before performing a second time in 2016 in Brooklyn, New York City.[15]\n\nSide projects: 2002–2008\nAfter their split in April 2001, Skin embarked on a solo career. Her debut solo album Fleshwounds, co-written with longtime songwriting partner Len Arran was released in September 2003 and Fake Chemical State was released in March 2006. She has also provided vocals for a number of other acts' songs.\n\nAce released a low-key album, Still Hungry, under the name Ace Sounds, which featured many collaborations including Shingai Shoniwa from Noisettes and Skye from Morcheeba. He later joined a band called \"Inner Mantra\". Ace is also a tutor at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music\n\nIn 2002 Cass recorded the album Scars with Gary Moore, and played bass and performed backing vocals. Cass also played various instruments on Skin's first solo album. When not recording he concentrates on photography.\n\nMark recorded sessions for various artists including Skin before joining Feeder after the death of their original drummer, Jon Lee.[16][17] Mark has also been tutoring at the Brighton Institute with bandmate Ace.\n\nReunion: 2009–2010\nMark Richardson confirmed reports that the band was reforming in an interview with Drummer Magazine (November 2008 issue), and said that the band planned to release a \"best of\" compilation as well as new material. Ace later set up an official page for the band on MySpace.\n\nOn 2 and 3 April 2009, two shows took place at the Monto Water Rats (the former venue of the Splash Club) in London, under the alias SCAM (Skin, Cass, Ace, Mark) and sold out in 20 minutes.[18] The band began their \"Greatest Hits\" tour on Friday, 9 October 2009 at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, with other dates across Europe. It was their first actual tour in eight years.[needs update] A \"greatest hits\" album, Smashes and Trashes, was released 2 November 2009. It is a 15-track career-embracing album and includes three brand new tracks: \"Because of You\", \"Tear the Place Up\" and \"Squander\".

The name \"Skunk Anansie\" is taken from the West African folk tales of Anansi the spider-man, with \"Skunk\" added to \"make the name nastier\". They are often grouped as part of a Britrock movement, running alongside Britpop. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 141 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. When the book first published this annual top 500 list in 2000, it only involved weeks spent on the singles chart until 2004's 17th edition, meaning the band's highest ranking has not been notified in any of the past editions. Their longest running release is 1996's Stoosh album with 55 weeks and a peak of No. 9. The band released their fifth studio album Wonderlustre (their first studio album after their reformation) internationally on 13 September 2010, preceded in August by its first single \"My Ugly Boy\".\n\nOn June 11, 2012, Skunk Anansie announced their new studio album titled 'Black Traffic' which they will be releasing in September 2012, via their own label working in partnership with 100% Records. The announcement follows what has been a hugely successful return for the band, who regrouped in 2009 following an eight- year hiatus.",
