      "biography": "Tim Burgess (born Timothy Allan Burgess on May 30, 1967, in Salford, Lancashire, England) is the lead singer of British rock/indie act The Charlatans. He joined the Charlatans in 1989 and was signed, with the band, by Beggars Banquet Records in 1990. Prior to this he was the lead singer in The Electric Crayons. Tim also Featured on Saint Etienne's 1993 Christmas single \"I was born on Christmas day\".\n\nBurgess's debut solo album, I Believe, was released in the UK on the 8 September 2003. In 2004 he collaborated with The Chemical Brothers, singing on the track \"The Boxer\" from their album Push the Button. Burgess had previously appeared with The Chemical Brothers on the 1995 track Life Is Sweet taken from their debut album Exit Planet Dust.\n\nAs Tim Burgess has lived in Los Angeles for some years, far away from the other band members who still live in England, fans feared that The Charlatans may split following the release of I Believe, which included the outstanding Oh My Corazon, but the band reformed to record Up at the Lake in 2004.\n\n2006 saw Burgess return with the Charlatans, releasing another album Simpatico. A change in style, it had a more reggae and Ska-like sound to it. Burgess also sang guest vocals on Mexican band Zoé's album \"Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón Atómico de la Vía Láctea\".\n\nTim is also a member of a \"seriously underground\" group called The Chavs, along with The Libertines' Carl Barât. The Band traditionally only play once a year at the Tap'n'Tin club in Chatham Kent. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Burgess\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
