      "biography": "Rush is a Canadian rock band formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal on their first album, then encompassing hard rock, progressive rock, and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. They have been cited as an influence by various musical artists, including Metallica, Primus, and The Smashing Pumpkins,as well as progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater and Symphony X.\n\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush's sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\nThe band finished the second leg of the Time Machine Tour in July 2011 and released their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels in June 2012 with a supporting tour in the fall.",

            "content": "Caress of Steel is the third studio album by Rush, released in 1975. The album shows more of Rush's adherence to the standards of progressive rock. Long pieces, pieces broken up into parts, and solo passages of speed and agility are all included. The album is often considered notable for the inclusion of the band's first epic piece, \"The Fountain Of Lamneth\", which runs to nearly 20 minutes and comprised the whole of side two of the original vinyl release. Intended to be Rush's breakthrough album, it sold fewer copies than their previous record and was considered a disappointment by their record company, with the tour becoming known as the \"Down The Tubes Tour\".\n\nDespite its relatively poor sales, the album charted higher in the US than Rush's previous release Fly by Night (as stated in the liner notes to Rush's The Spirit of Radio Greatest Hits 1974-87 album). The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1993. The next year's follow-up album, 2112 would pave the way for Rush's commercial success with its own 21-minute epic.\n\nOriginally, the album cover was supposed to be in silver hue to give it a \"steel\" appearance. A printing error resulted in a copper color for the album cover.\n\nSome cassette printings of this album had \"Didacts and Narpets\" and \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" switch places (possibly due to cassette tape length and to balance out both sides), and all of the movements of \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" were listed as separate songs.\n\n \n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, except where noted.\n\n\n Side one\n\"Bastille Day\" – 4:37 \n\"I Think I'm Going Bald\" – 3:37 \n\"Lakeside Park\" – 4:08 \n\"The Necromancer\" – 12:30 \n\"I. Into the Darkness\" – 4:12 \n\"II. Under the Shadow\" – 4:25 \n\"III. Return of the Prince\" – 3:52 \nSide two\n\"The Fountain of Lamneth\" – 19:58 \n\"I. In the Valley\" – 4:18 \n\"II. Didacts and Narpets\" – 1:00 \n\"III. No One at the Bridge\" – 4:19 \n\"IV. Panacea\" (music: Lee) – 3:14 \n\"V. Bacchus Plateau\" (music: Lee) – 3:16 \n\"VI. The Fountain\" – 3:49 \n\n\nBastille Day\nRush's Led Zeppelin influence is still prominent on this record, most obviously in the song \"Bastille Day\" (which discusses the storming of the Bastille in the French Revolution), though it is apparent on all three of the shorter songs on the album. \"Bastille Day\" reappeared on the \"R30\" CD and DVD as part of the instrumental R30 Overture.\n\nI Think I'm Going Bald\n\"I Think I'm Going Bald\" was written for Canadian rocker Kim Mitchell, who at the time was the frontman of the band Max Webster. It is also stated in the book \"Contents Under Pressure\", that the song \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" was written as an homage to KISS' \"Goin' Blind\".\n\n\nLakeside Park\nMentioned in the song \"Lakeside Park\", May 24 is Victoria Day, a Canadian holiday. Lakeside Park itself is a park in Port Dalhousie, St. Catharines, Ontario, where lyricist Neil Peart grew up and worked as a teenager during the summer.\n\n\nThe Necromancer\nA necromancer is one who practices necromancy, a type of divination involving the summoning of Operative Spirits to discern information about the future. \"The Necromancer\" starts with heavy influence from J.R.R. Tolkien's literary mythology. The Necromancer was a pseudonym used by Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings for the character Sauron. The song departs from the story of the book as Part III sees the return of By-Tor from Fly by Night, this time as a hero and not a villain. \"Return of the Prince\" was also released as a single in some countries.\n\nOn the inside gatefold of the album, just below the lyrics to \"The Necromancer\", the Latin phrase \"Terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus\" appears. This translates (loosely) to:\n\n\" The hour ends the day; the author ends his work\". \nThe Fountain of Lamneth\nThe final song on the album , \"The Fountain of Lamneth\", predates epics like \"2112\" and the Cygnus X-1 series, and is only 34 seconds shorter than \"2112\". It also forms a complete story, this one about a man in search of the Fountain of Lamneth, and chronicles the individual occurrences of his journey.\n Didacts and Narpets\nRegarding \"Didacts and Narpets\" (which consists mostly of a drum solo), in the October 1991 news release from the Rush Backstage Club, Neil Peart said: \"Okay, I may have answered this before, but if not, the shouted words in that song represent an argument between Our Hero and the Didacts and Narpets - teachers and parents. I honestly can't remember what the actual words were, but they took up opposite positions like: \"Work! Live! Earn! Give!\" and like that.\" A didact is a teacher, and \"narpet\" is an anagram of \"parent\". Credits\nGeddy Lee - bass guitar and vocals \nAlex Lifeson - 6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars, classical guitar, steel guitar \nNeil Peart - lyrics and percussion \n\nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1975 Pop Albums 113 \n\n\nA remaster was issued in 1997.\n\nThe tray has a picture of star with man painting with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left. All remasters from Rush through to Permanent Waves are like this. This is just like the cover art of Retrospective I. \nThe remaster adds the album's back cover and gatefold (which included band pictures and lyrics) to the packaging which was not included on original CD. \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/Caress+of+Steel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
