      "biography": "The Pharcyde /ËˆfÉ‘rsaÉªd/ is an alternative hip hop group based in South Central Los Angeles. The original four members of the group are Imani (Emandu Wilcox), Slimkid3 (Trevant Hardson), Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson) and Fatlip (Derrick Stewart). DJ Mark Luv was the group's first DJ, followed by producer J-Swift and then J Dilla. The group is best known for the hit singles \"Drop\", \"Passin' Me By\" and \"Runnin'\", as well as their first album, Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde.\nPharcyde group members Slimkid3, Bootie Brown, and Imani met as dancers in the late 1980s and dancing was their main ambition as late as 1990. Around this time, Imani and Slimkid3 were in a group called \"As Is\" and later a group called the \"Play Brothers\", whilst Bootie Brown was a backup dancer for Fatlip (Fatlip being the last member to join the group). Bootie Brown recalls that their earlier dancing careers influenced their rapping - \"sometimes the way I rap is almost like the way I used to dance\". The group met Reggie Andrews, a local high-school music teacher who worked with the Dazz Band and Rick James, and who was a major musical influence on their debut album. The group also met producer J-Swift around this time, as he was Reggie Andrews's \"star pupil\" according to the book Check the Technique.",

      "editorial_notes": "A jovial, playful-yet-personal debut, 1992’s <i>Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde</i> marked a landmark moment in alternative hip-hop. Irrepressible goofballs and incisive diarists, the four members of Los Angeles’ The Pharcyde—Slimkid3, Fatlip, Imani and Bootie Brown—were capable of both off-the-wall weirdness and incisive self-reflection, of furious rhyme antics and shocks of melody. Emo before emo-rap, Pharcyde eschewed hip-hop braggadocio for something more self-deprecating. Combined with great comic timing, animated personalities and an arsenal of “ya mama” jokes, the group laid down a blueprint for a generation of underground rappers.\n\nPharcyde cut a stark figure in the gangsta-rap-dominated ’90s: The members might break out in song in the middle of a verse, or joke like four Biz Markies—all while accompanied by beats anchored by the freewheeling jazz loops of producer J-Swift. And while rappers like Big Daddy Kane were playing the Casanova game, The Pharcyde opted to explore their unrequited loves, friend-zone moments and various humiliations on “Passin’ Me By”, one of the album’s standout tracks. Slimkid3 insists the four tales in the song are all true, and the mix of raw honesty, along with a lush Quincy Jones loop, made it an instant hip-hop classic. Slimkid3 plumbed the depths of a broken heart once again for the follow-up single “Otha Fish”, a delirious song about emotional restoration that flows like liquid between rapping and singing.\n\n<i>Bizarre Ride</i> was the greatest West Coast hip-hop album of 1992 that wasn’t <i>The Chronic</i>—and it couldn’t have been more different than the oncoming laid-back G-Funk revolution. A lively, giddy energy burst, it was the funniest, most irreverent hip-hop album of its day, as evidenced by Fatlip doing a maniacal horror-flick phone call (“4 Better or 4 Worse”), or breaking into a Public Enemy impersonation to complain about the DMV (“Officer”). The album’s jokes peak with “Ya Mama”, a dizzying snap-fest that also includes some inventive four-part harmonies.\n\n<i>Bizarre Ride</i> has a legacy that extends far past its role as a beacon of alternative rap and subterranean Los Angeles. “Passin’ Me By” made a comeback in 2001, when R&B singer Joe repurposed it for his No. 1 hit “Stutter”. In 2013, “Passin’ Me By” returned to the zeitgeist when T.I. referenced it for his verse on Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines”. And Kanye West, another rapper who went against the grain by dealing in personal reflection, would famously declare <i>Bizarre Ride</i> as nothing short of his favourite album of all time. The Pharcyde would continue their trailblazing streak for years afterward. But <i>Bizarre Ride</i> would forever serve as the triumphant moment when a group of California cut-ups helped pave the way for some of hip-hop’s more eccentric visions.",

In the years after its release, Bizarre Ride was hailed by critics and alternative rap fans and appeared in \"best albums\" lists in several publications.\n\nReleased during the dominant Gangsta rap era of West Coast hip-hop, Bizarre Ride was described as \"refreshing,\" due to its playful, light-hearted humor and lush, jazzy production. Along with albums like To Whom it May Concern… by Freestyle Fellowship, and I Wish My Brother George Was Here by Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Bizarre Ride helped establish a new alternative scene on the West Coast, followed by artists such as Hieroglyphics, The Coup and Jurassic 5. Despite the wide acclaim, the album produced only moderate sales, peaking at #75 on the Billboard 200 album chart in 1993.
