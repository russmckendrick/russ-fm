  "biography": "Considered a prominent figure in the development of instrumental hip-hop, DJ Shadow (real name Josh Davis) has proven himself with groundbreaking, genre-defining solo output on such respected labels as Solesides and Mo' Wax.\n\nDJ Shadow spent his teenage years in Davis, California and was a DJ at the community radio station KDVS. During his time as a radio disc jockey, DJ Shadow was significant in developing the experimental instrumental hip-hop style associated with the California-based Solesides record label. His early singles for the label, including In/Flux and Lost and Found (S.F.L.), were genre-bending works of art merging elements of funk, rock, hip-hop, ambient, jazz, soul, and used-bin found records. DJ Shadow is often cited as a leading creator of trip-hop, though this is a label he strongly contests.\n\nAlthough he previously released a couple of original works (during 1991-1992 for Hollywood Records) by the time Mo' Wax's James Lavelle contacted him about releasing In/Flux on the fledgling imprint, it wasn't until his distribution association with Mo' Wax that his sound began to mature and cohere.\n\nShadow's first full-length work, Endtroducing....., was released in late 1996 to immense critical acclaim. Following the success of this album, he acted as a shadow producer for Rage Against The Machine for their album, Evil Empire. It is said he influenced the solo on their song \"Bulls On Parade\". Endtroducing... made the Guinness World Records book for \"First Completely Sampled Album\" in 2001. Preemptive Strike, a compilation of early singles, followed in early 1998. Later that year, Shadow produced tracks for Psyence Fiction, the debut album by U.N.K.L.E., a long-time Mo' Wax production team that gained superstar guests including Thom Yorke (of Radiohead), Richard Ashcroft (of The Verve), Mike D (of the Beastie Boys) and others. His next project came in 1999, with the transformation of Solesides into a new label, Quannum Projects. Nearly six years after his debut production album, his second album, The Private Press, was released in June 2002. In the same year, the movie \"Scratch\" (2001, Doug Pray) was released to DVD with DJ Shadow appearing several times throughout the movie.\n\nThe documentary films \"Dark Days\" and \"Wisconsin Death Trip\" feature music of DJ Shadow while \"Scratch\" features an interview and more music.\n\nDJ Shadow has also collaborated with fellow artist Cut Chemist. Together they have made two CDs entitled Brainfreeze and Product Placement. These albums fuse jazz, funk, and soul in the framework of a cohesive concept. The second of these (Product Placement) followed a very similar pattern to the first, but using remixes/other versions of the songs in roughly the same order.\n\nIn the year 2004, Shadow released his feature length DVD, In Tune and On Time. The DVD features a live performance in London, emphasizing intricate visuals.\n\nIn 2005, Shadow released a Deluxe Edition of his first album, Endtroducing.... and a new album, titled \"The Outsider\" in 2006.\n\nWhile Shadow's earlier works, especially 'Endtroducing.....', are known for their innovation in genres such as hip-hop, ambient, and trip-hop, his fourth full length album, The Outsider, had several tracks dedicated to Hyphy. This decision has been controversial, leaving many fans feeling alienated. DJ Shadow addressed this point in an August, 2006 interview, in which stated, \"Repeat Endtroducing over and over again? That was never, ever in the game plan. Fuck that. So I think it's time for certain fans to decide if they are fans of the album, or the artist.\"\n\nAlso in 2005, Brian Udelhofen began work on the Shadow Percussion Project, an attempt to adapt some of the tracks from Endtroducing... for a live performance group. The result was largely successful and well-received by DJ Shadow himself.\n\nIn 2007 DJ Shadow was contacted by the Hollywood Bowl to do a show featuring Freeze with Cut Chemist. However, not wanting to repeat old material DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist came up with a whole new routine entitled The Hard Sell. In 2007 and 2008 they went on The Hard Sell tour and were accompanied on stage by two large video screens with visuals created for the tour. \n\nDiscography\n\nSolo Albums\n\n    * 1996 - Endtroducing.....\n    * 1998 - Preemptive Strike\n    * 2000 - Dark Days\n    * 2002 - The Private Press\n    * 2003 - The Private Repress (Japanese Remix Album)\n    * 2004 - In Tune and On Time\n    * 2005 - Endtroducing...

      "profile": "Joshua Davis (born June 29, 1972 in San José, California), better known by his stage name DJ Shadow, is an American record producer and DJ. He first gained notice with the release of his acclaimed debut studio album, \"Endtroducing…\". He has a personal record collection of over 60,000 records.\r\n\r\nDJ Shadow is widely credited as a key figure in developing the experimental instrumental hip-hop style associated with the London-based [l111] label. Inspired by hip-hop's early years, he then grew to absorb the heyday of crews like Eric B. & Rakim, Ultramagnetic MCs, and Public Enemy; groups which prominently featured DJs in their ranks.\r\n\r\nJosh \"Shadow\" Davis had already been experimenting with making beats and breaks on a four-track recorder while he was in high school in the Nor-Cal college town of Davis, but it was during university that he co-founded his own Solesides label as an outlet for his original tracks. Hooking up with Davis' few b-boys (including eventual Solesides artists Blackalicious and Lyrics Born) through the college radio station, Shadow began releasing the Hip-Hop Reconstruction mix tapes in 1991, eventually catching the attention of The Source magazine and Dave Funkenklein. Shadow was featured in the magazine's \"Unsigned Hype\" column in 1991, and Klein signed him to a production deal with Hollywood BASIC records. Concurrently, Shadow provided beats and scratches for Bay Area rapper Paris and was featured on his second album. In 1993, Shadow pressed his 17-minute beat-head symphony \"Entropy\". His tracks spread widely through the DJ-strong hip-hop underground, eventually reaching James Lavelle of Mo Wax.\r\n\r\nShadow's first full-length, \"Endtroducing…\" was released on the label in late 1996 to immense critical acclaim in United Kingdom and the United States. \"Preemptive Strike\", a compilation of early singles, followed in early 1998. Later that year, Shadow produced tracks for the debut album by U.N.K.L.E., a longtime Mo' Wax production team that gained superstar guests including Thom Yorke (of Radiohead), Richard Ashcroft (of The Verve), Mike D (of Beastie Boys), and others.\r\n\r\nHis next project came in 1999, with the transformation of Solesides into a new label, Quannum Projects. Nearly six years after his debut production album, the proper follow-up, \"The Private Press\", was released in June 2002. The following year Shadow released a mix album, \"Diminishing Returns\", and in 2004 he released a live album and DVD, \"Live! In Tune and on Time\". In 2006 he released another long awaited full-length album \"The Outsider\", which featured rising Bay Area Hyphy rappers including Keak Da Sneak and E-40. \"The Outsider\" also featured a single with Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest), which led to Shadow's first appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman.\r\n\r\nBetween 2007 and 2009 Shadow released three volumes of \"The 4-Track Era Collection\", a series of his earliest recordings. The 4-Track Era project was exclusively available through his web store, ShopDjShadow.com. In the midst of all of these solo projects, DJ Shadow collaborated with fellow hip-hop DJ Cut Chemist. Together they created a series of mixes that fused soul, funk, and rock, in the framework of a cohesive concept involving using only 45 rpm records (7 inches). These mixes include Brainfreeze, Product Placement, and The Hard Sell, which would be debuted at the Hollywood Bowl.\r\n\r\nShadow's website relaunched in August 2009, enabling him to sell digital downloads direct to his fans through his own autonomous storefront. 2009 also saw the announcement of Shadow's involvement with DJ Hero, an Activision video game which features Shadow as a playable character within the game. Shadow also contributed several mixes to the game.\r\n\r\n2010 and 2011 saw a tour throughout Europe and North America entitled \"Live From The Shadowsphere\". Hailed for its visual innovations, the tour was cited by Beatport as one of the top 10 DJ shows of all time, and was capped off by two memorable performances at the Coachella Festival.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, DJ Shadow released \"The Less You Know, The Better\" purportedly his last full-length album to prominently feature samples. 2012 included \"Total Breakdown, Hidden Transmissions From The MPC Era (1992–1996)\", an archival project; and \"Reconstructed: The Best of DJ Shadow\", a greatest hits album.\r\n\r\n2012 saw a shift in Shadow's live person...at the request of trendsetting Los Angeles club night Low End Theory, he returned to playing traditional, contemporary DJ sets, often eschewing his own music for that of peers.\r\n\r\nThe hard-hitting sets Shadow played coexisted with the rise of trap, juke, and the fledgling beat scene, catching the ear of large-scale EDM icons such as Diplo and Bassnectar, with whom Shadow performed. An incident at a Miami superclub, in which Shadow refused to temper his set to suit management, was captured on video and went viral, prompting a debate about the autonomy of DJs and the music they play. This only seemed to heighten demand for Shadow as 2013 reportedly saw him play over 100 shows.\r\n\r\nAlso in 2013, Shadow lent a hand to video game franchise Grand Theft Auto V, compiling and arranging elements of the soundtrack. Notable was his return to production, crafting a remix for Machinedrum, (whom Shadow performed with at Fabric in London and Amsterdam) and 1970s Dutch progressive band Supersister, who Shadow had previously sampled. In 2014, Shadow toured Australia and performed at SXSW for Vice.\r\n\r\nAccording to his Twitter account, Shadow plans to spend time in the studio and continue to perform his contemporary DJ sets. He has indicated that a new, \"very different\"; type of tour is planned for the Fall of 2014.\r\n\r\nLaunched his own record label [l=Liquid Amber] in 2014.\r\n\r\nPublishing companies include: [l400205], [l400279], [l431815], [l440747].",

        "profile": "Joshua Davis (born June 29, 1972 in San José, California), better known by his stage name DJ Shadow, is an American record producer and DJ. He first gained notice with the release of his acclaimed debut studio album, \"Endtroducing…\". He has a personal record collection of over 60,000 records.\r\n\r\nDJ Shadow is widely credited as a key figure in developing the experimental instrumental hip-hop style associated with the London-based [l111] label. Inspired by hip-hop's early years, he then grew to absorb the heyday of crews like Eric B. & Rakim, Ultramagnetic MCs, and Public Enemy; groups which prominently featured DJs in their ranks.\r\n\r\nJosh \"Shadow\" Davis had already been experimenting with making beats and breaks on a four-track recorder while he was in high school in the Nor-Cal college town of Davis, but it was during university that he co-founded his own Solesides label as an outlet for his original tracks. Hooking up with Davis' few b-boys (including eventual Solesides artists Blackalicious and Lyrics Born) through the college radio station, Shadow began releasing the Hip-Hop Reconstruction mix tapes in 1991, eventually catching the attention of The Source magazine and Dave Funkenklein. Shadow was featured in the magazine's \"Unsigned Hype\" column in 1991, and Klein signed him to a production deal with Hollywood BASIC records. Concurrently, Shadow provided beats and scratches for Bay Area rapper Paris and was featured on his second album. In 1993, Shadow pressed his 17-minute beat-head symphony \"Entropy\". His tracks spread widely through the DJ-strong hip-hop underground, eventually reaching James Lavelle of Mo Wax.\r\n\r\nShadow's first full-length, \"Endtroducing…\" was released on the label in late 1996 to immense critical acclaim in United Kingdom and the United States. \"Preemptive Strike\", a compilation of early singles, followed in early 1998. Later that year, Shadow produced tracks for the debut album by U.N.K.L.E., a longtime Mo' Wax production team that gained superstar guests including Thom Yorke (of Radiohead), Richard Ashcroft (of The Verve), Mike D (of Beastie Boys), and others.\r\n\r\nHis next project came in 1999, with the transformation of Solesides into a new label, Quannum Projects. Nearly six years after his debut production album, the proper follow-up, \"The Private Press\", was released in June 2002. The following year Shadow released a mix album, \"Diminishing Returns\", and in 2004 he released a live album and DVD, \"Live! In Tune and on Time\". In 2006 he released another long awaited full-length album \"The Outsider\", which featured rising Bay Area Hyphy rappers including Keak Da Sneak and E-40. \"The Outsider\" also featured a single with Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest), which led to Shadow's first appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman.\r\n\r\nBetween 2007 and 2009 Shadow released three volumes of \"The 4-Track Era Collection\", a series of his earliest recordings. The 4-Track Era project was exclusively available through his web store, ShopDjShadow.com. In the midst of all of these solo projects, DJ Shadow collaborated with fellow hip-hop DJ Cut Chemist. Together they created a series of mixes that fused soul, funk, and rock, in the framework of a cohesive concept involving using only 45 rpm records (7 inches). These mixes include Brainfreeze, Product Placement, and The Hard Sell, which would be debuted at the Hollywood Bowl.\r\n\r\nShadow's website relaunched in August 2009, enabling him to sell digital downloads direct to his fans through his own autonomous storefront. 2009 also saw the announcement of Shadow's involvement with DJ Hero, an Activision video game which features Shadow as a playable character within the game. Shadow also contributed several mixes to the game.\r\n\r\n2010 and 2011 saw a tour throughout Europe and North America entitled \"Live From The Shadowsphere\". Hailed for its visual innovations, the tour was cited by Beatport as one of the top 10 DJ shows of all time, and was capped off by two memorable performances at the Coachella Festival.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, DJ Shadow released \"The Less You Know, The Better\" purportedly his last full-length album to prominently feature samples. 2012 included \"Total Breakdown, Hidden Transmissions From The MPC Era (1992–1996)\", an archival project; and \"Reconstructed: The Best of DJ Shadow\", a greatest hits album.\r\n\r\n2012 saw a shift in Shadow's live person...at the request of trendsetting Los Angeles club night Low End Theory, he returned to playing traditional, contemporary DJ sets, often eschewing his own music for that of peers.\r\n\r\nThe hard-hitting sets Shadow played coexisted with the rise of trap, juke, and the fledgling beat scene, catching the ear of large-scale EDM icons such as Diplo and Bassnectar, with whom Shadow performed. An incident at a Miami superclub, in which Shadow refused to temper his set to suit management, was captured on video and went viral, prompting a debate about the autonomy of DJs and the music they play. This only seemed to heighten demand for Shadow as 2013 reportedly saw him play over 100 shows.\r\n\r\nAlso in 2013, Shadow lent a hand to video game franchise Grand Theft Auto V, compiling and arranging elements of the soundtrack. Notable was his return to production, crafting a remix for Machinedrum, (whom Shadow performed with at Fabric in London and Amsterdam) and 1970s Dutch progressive band Supersister, who Shadow had previously sampled. In 2014, Shadow toured Australia and performed at SXSW for Vice.\r\n\r\nAccording to his Twitter account, Shadow plans to spend time in the studio and continue to perform his contemporary DJ sets. He has indicated that a new, \"very different\"; type of tour is planned for the Fall of 2014.\r\n\r\nLaunched his own record label [l=Liquid Amber] in 2014.\r\n\r\nPublishing companies include: [l400205], [l400279], [l431815], [l440747].",

      "bio_content": "Considered a prominent figure in the development of instrumental hip-hop, DJ Shadow (real name Josh Davis) has proven himself with groundbreaking, genre-defining solo output on such respected labels as Solesides and Mo' Wax.\n\nDJ Shadow spent his teenage years in Davis, California and was a DJ at the community radio station KDVS. During his time as a radio disc jockey, DJ Shadow was significant in developing the experimental instrumental hip-hop style associated with the California-based Solesides record label. His early singles for the label, including In/Flux and Lost and Found (S.F.L.), were genre-bending works of art merging elements of funk, rock, hip-hop, ambient, jazz, soul, and used-bin found records. DJ Shadow is often cited as a leading creator of trip-hop, though this is a label he strongly contests.\n\nAlthough he previously released a couple of original works (during 1991-1992 for Hollywood Records) by the time Mo' Wax's James Lavelle contacted him about releasing In/Flux on the fledgling imprint, it wasn't until his distribution association with Mo' Wax that his sound began to mature and cohere.\n\nShadow's first full-length work, Endtroducing....., was released in late 1996 to immense critical acclaim. Following the success of this album, he acted as a shadow producer for Rage Against The Machine for their album, Evil Empire. It is said he influenced the solo on their song \"Bulls On Parade\". Endtroducing... made the Guinness World Records book for \"First Completely Sampled Album\" in 2001. Preemptive Strike, a compilation of early singles, followed in early 1998. Later that year, Shadow produced tracks for Psyence Fiction, the debut album by U.N.K.L.E., a long-time Mo' Wax production team that gained superstar guests including Thom Yorke (of Radiohead), Richard Ashcroft (of The Verve), Mike D (of the Beastie Boys) and others. His next project came in 1999, with the transformation of Solesides into a new label, Quannum Projects. Nearly six years after his debut production album, his second album, The Private Press, was released in June 2002. In the same year, the movie \"Scratch\" (2001, Doug Pray) was released to DVD with DJ Shadow appearing several times throughout the movie.\n\nThe documentary films \"Dark Days\" and \"Wisconsin Death Trip\" feature music of DJ Shadow while \"Scratch\" features an interview and more music.\n\nDJ Shadow has also collaborated with fellow artist Cut Chemist. Together they have made two CDs entitled Brainfreeze and Product Placement. These albums fuse jazz, funk, and soul in the framework of a cohesive concept. The second of these (Product Placement) followed a very similar pattern to the first, but using remixes/other versions of the songs in roughly the same order.\n\nIn the year 2004, Shadow released his feature length DVD, In Tune and On Time. The DVD features a live performance in London, emphasizing intricate visuals.\n\nIn 2005, Shadow released a Deluxe Edition of his first album, Endtroducing.... and a new album, titled \"The Outsider\" in 2006.\n\nWhile Shadow's earlier works, especially 'Endtroducing.....', are known for their innovation in genres such as hip-hop, ambient, and trip-hop, his fourth full length album, The Outsider, had several tracks dedicated to Hyphy. This decision has been controversial, leaving many fans feeling alienated. DJ Shadow addressed this point in an August, 2006 interview, in which stated, \"Repeat Endtroducing over and over again? That was never, ever in the game plan. Fuck that. So I think it's time for certain fans to decide if they are fans of the album, or the artist.\"\n\nAlso in 2005, Brian Udelhofen began work on the Shadow Percussion Project, an attempt to adapt some of the tracks from Endtroducing... for a live performance group. The result was largely successful and well-received by DJ Shadow himself.\n\nIn 2007 DJ Shadow was contacted by the Hollywood Bowl to do a show featuring Freeze with Cut Chemist. However, not wanting to repeat old material DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist came up with a whole new routine entitled The Hard Sell. In 2007 and 2008 they went on The Hard Sell tour and were accompanied on stage by two large video screens with visuals created for the tour. \n\nDiscography\n\nSolo Albums\n\n    * 1996 - Endtroducing.....\n    * 1998 - Preemptive Strike\n    * 2000 - Dark Days\n    * 2002 - The Private Press\n    * 2003 - The Private Repress (Japanese Remix Album)\n    * 2004 - In Tune and On Time\n    * 2005 - Endtroducing...
