      "biography": "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

      "editorial_notes": "During the run-up to the release of Radiohead’s 2000 electronic opus <i>Kid A</i>, the band members often spoke about breaking up. It was, in part, a hypothetical consideration, one that preceded the album’s recording sessions: If the group’s heralded 1997 release <i>OK Computer</i> was such a masterpiece, why bother trying to top it? But it was also an acknowledgement of the intra-band tension involved in the making of <i>Kid A</i>. That album—which found Radiohead pushing past their guitar-rock sound—had led to shouting matches and tirades, power plays and pity parties. Could the bandmates actually endure making a follow-up?\n\nBut as Radiohead toured in support of <i>Kid A</i>—which at one point had been conceived as a double album—the members began listening to the dozens of songs and sketches that didn’t make the cut the first time around. Which is why, just seven months after <i>Kid A</i>’s release, Radiohead returned with 2001’s <i>Amnesiac</i>—an album Thom Yorke described as “our secret weapon against all the weirdness going on.” It was a surprisingly cohesive companion that at once felt more esoteric and accessible than its predecessor. And <i>Amnesiac</i> proved that the electronic explorations and the fragmented lyrical codex of <i>Kid A</i> weren’t a fluke: This was now Radiohead, at a new vanguard of rock.\n\nInformed by Charles Mingus, “Pyramid Song” is one of the prettiest songs in Radiohead’s catalogue, its meaty piano chords and ominous electronic tide lifting Yorke’s falsetto croon. And though it’s a polemic against Tony Blair and politicians like him, “You and Whose Army?” is an exquisite drift, anchored by Colin Greenwood’s perfect bassline. “Life in a Glasshouse”, meanwhile, unfurls over the jazz-band sighs of British trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton. It’s a song you could slip into a family holiday playlist—so long as the volume remained low enough to hide its little symphony of dissonance.\n\n<i>Amnesiac</i> also proved just how far the group had ventured into electronics and abstraction. The askance percussion samples of “Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box” dart around its dance-floor rhythm like a tease, with Yorke riding the beat with stunning R&B aplomb. And the band wanders into electro-acoustic territory for “Hunting Bears”, which features a pensive spaghetti-western guitar slowly sinking into itself. Meanwhile, “Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors” remains one of the most aggressive Radiohead cuts, its mix of battering-ram arrhythmia, prepared piano strikes and static loops clawing at Yorke’s warped voice like the track is an existential battle for space. What <i>Amnesiac</i> lacks in clear narrative it makes up for in breadth—and in its ability to suggest the many directions in which Radiohead might still move.",
