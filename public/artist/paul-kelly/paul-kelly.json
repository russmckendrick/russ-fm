  "biography": "There are at least nine artists with the name Paul Kelly: \n1) an Australian singer-songwriter\n2) an American film and TV composer\n3) an American soul singer & songwriter\n4) an Irish folk singer and songwriter\n5) a member of  British bands Birdie and East Village\n6) a member of English rock band Northern Uproar\n7) an English multi-instrumentalist for The Islanders\n8) an American bass player\n9) a member of The Martial Arts, BMX Bandits and How to Swim\n\n1) Paul Kelly is an Australian singer-songwriter, based in Melbourne, and widely considered as an icon of Australian music. He has released music under his own name and as Paul Kelly and the Messengers, Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls, and Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys.  His output has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output comfortably straddles folk, rock, and even some country. His lyrics, simply and laconically voiced, have managed to speak to Australian experiences and history perhaps more broadly and directly than any other artist.\n\n2) Paul Kelly is an American composer based in New York City.  He is the talent that brings music to the world of film, TV, and advertising. He has been sought after by renowned directors, like Oliver Stone, for his blockbuster films, Savages, Any Given Sunday, Comandante and Oscar-Nominated short film Everything In This Country Must.  Glowing reviews that Kelly has received, can be seen in the following from Thom Jurek, Soundings in Film, who say, “His moving sound constructions are full of emotions and moods — not all of them pleasant — and his takes on funk, rock, and blues are not journeyman, but those of a musician who takes these art forms seriously and seeks to represent them accurately in his utterances. Kelly may be a sketcher, but his sketches stand on their own outside the realm of the image,” and Frank O. Gutch Jr, Evolution In Film, who give glowing context to the work of Kelly in the following, “Paul Kelly knows what music is. He knows that it can be a setup, a climax, or an anticlimax. He knows the value of music applied to other media. More than that, he knows music. Not at all unlike a classical composer or even the rock band which plays beyond the fringe, he creates music for a reason.”\nVisit http://paulkelly.com for more information.\n\n3) Paul Kelly (born Paul Laurence Dunbar Kelly in Overtown, Miami, Florida, USA on 19 June 1940) is an American Soul singer, musician and producer. He is best known for the song \"Stealing in the Name of the Lord\", which was a hit in 1970. And in 1974 another hit with \"Hooked, Hogtied & Collared\" from the album with the same title. He also wrote \"Personally\", which has been widely-covered, and was a hit for soul singer Jackie Moore, as well as country singers Karla Bonoff and Ronnie McDowell. Other songs have been covered by gospel artists, including The Mighty Clouds Of Joy and The Staple Singers.\n\n4) Paul Kelly (born 1957 in Dublin) is an Irish folk singer and songwriter. He has played Irish traditional music, bluegrass and country, and is equally at home in a variety of different styles of music.\n\n5) Paul Kelly is a British member of Birdie and East Village\n\n6) Paul Kelly is a member of English rock band Northern Uproar\n\n7) Paul Kelly is an English multi-instrumentalist for The Islanders\n\n8) Paul Kelly is an American bass player\n\n9) a member of The Martial Arts, BMX Bandits and How to Swim <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Kelly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
