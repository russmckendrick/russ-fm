      "biography": "Stereolab is an Anglo-French avant-pop band formed in London, England in 1990. They are known for their unique style, mixing 1950s–1960s pop and lounge music with the “motorik” beat of krautrock, was one of the first to which the term “post-rock” was applied. People frequently refer to their style as being \"avant-pop.\" They are noted for the use of vintage keyboard instruments like Moog synthesizers and Vox and Farfisa organs. Stereolab is also notable for founding their own record label, Duophonic Records, with a grant from UK charity The Prince’s Trust. The band is often referred to as “The Groop” by their fans (and in the title of their song “The Groop Play Chord X” on the album Space Age Batchelor Pad Music).\n\nThey were founded in 1990 by songwriters Tim Gane (guitar, keyboards), formerly of the band McCarthy, and Laetitia Sadier (sometimes credited as Seaya Sadier; vocals, keyboards, trombone, guitar), who is from France and sings in both English and French.\n\nOver the years, Gane and Sadier have enlisted a large number of other musicians to accompany them on stage and on record. The initial line-up featured Martin Kean, formerly of The Chills, on bass, and Joe Dilworth (from their Too Pure label-mates Th’ Faith Healers) on drums, with Russell Yates (of Moose) and Mick Conroy (ex-Modern English) also appearing at early live shows. In 1993 they recruited Andy Ramsay (drums), who has remained in the group line-up ever since, and Mary Hansen (vocals, guitar, keyboards, percussion). Hansen’s distinctive backing vocals became an important aspect of the Stereolab sound, and she remained a regular feature of the line-up until her death in a cycling accident on December 9, 2002. Multi-instrumentalist Sean O’Hagan of The High Llamas has also been a frequent contributor, particularly with string, brass and keyboard arrangements to the band’s studio albums. John McEntire (Tortoise) has also contributed keyboard, electronic effects and studio help over the years. Other members have come and (in some cases) gone over the years, including Duncan Brown, Dave Pajo (from Tortoise), Richard Harrison and Simon Johns (all bass); Gina Morris (vocals); and Katharine Gifford and Morgane Lhote (both on keyboards).\n\nEarly Stereolab material displayed a heavy influence of krautrock sounds, particularly Neu! and Faust, characteristically relying on droning, repetitive guitar or keyboard riffs, with or without vocals. Early heavy use of distorted Farfisa combo-organ sounds were also reminiscent of early recordings by The Modern Lovers. As the band developed, they incorporated new instrumentation, and an increasingly complex sense of rhythm and structure, frequently making use of irregular time signatures as well as unorthodox chord progressions and melodic intervals. The band has often made copious use of female backing vocal lines.\n\nLyrically, Stereolab’s music is quirky (song titles evoke memories of 1950s science fiction stories, and are often borrowed directly from old films and records of the period, but have nothing to do with the song’s content), but highly politically and philosophically charged, sometimes with a decidedly Surrealist or Situationist bent. (Sadier notes the libertarian Marxist theoretician Cornelius Castoriadis as a particular inspiration.) Sadier’s lyrics, in both French and English, often read like highly condensed sociological texts, standing in deliberate and distinct counterpoint to the lush hedonic pop sound of the band. A prime example would be “Ping Pong” from Mars Audiac Quintet, which is an explicit restating of Marxist theory concerning the relationship between economic cycles and war cycles.\n\nStereolab earned a minor place in the Britpop movement, with their sound proving influential to bands like Blur: occasional keyboard-driven b-sides and singer Damon Albarn’s love of retro keyboards showed the influence, and in recognition Laetitia Sadier was invited to provide vocals on “To The End” from Parklife.\n\nDespite the band’s fan base and critical acclaim, Stereolab has not achieved high levels of financial or popular success. On June 7, 2004, suits at the Warner Music label (to whom the band was signed in the U.S.) announced they were dropping Stereolab in response to the poor sales (40,000 to that date) of Margerine Eclipse. This was part of an ongoing effort by Warner to cut costs; The Breeders and Third Eye Blind were also dropped from the label for this reason. Laetitia Sadier is now also a member of Monade, which is essentially expressive of her own singular musical goals. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night is the sixth studio album by English-French rock band Stereolab. It was released on 21 September 1999 and was issued by Duophonic Records and Elektra Records. The album was largely co-produced by Stereolab, John McEntire, and Jim O'Rourke.\n\nStereolab produced Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night with John McEntire, who had co-produced the band's previous two studio albums Emperor Tomato Ketchup (1996) and Dots and Loops (1997), and Jim O'Rourke. Assisted by McEntire and O'Rourke, Stereolab recorded the bulk of Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night between November 1998 and February 1999, at Wolf Studios in London. As band members Tim Gane and Lætitia Sadier were occupied with raising their infant son at the time, Stereolab opted to record in London instead of Chicago, where McEntire and O'Rourke were typically based. The only material on the album that does not date to these sessions is one section of the song \"Italian Shoes Continuum\"; this section was produced by Stereolab and Fulton Dingley and recorded in February 1998 at Blackwing Studios in London.\n\nCobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night was released on 21 September 1999 in the United States by Elektra Records, and on 27 September 1999 in the United Kingdom by Duophonic Records. The track \"The Free Design\" was previously released on 6 September 1999; it was issued as a single (on 7\" vinyl) and as an EP (on CD and 12\" vinyl).\n\nA remastered and expanded edition of Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night was released by Duophonic and Warp on 13 September 2019. Coinciding with the re-release, \"Come and Play in the Milky Night\" was issued as a digital single on 5 September 2019.\n\nCobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night was released to middling reviews from music critics. Pitchfork's Brent DiCrescenzo wrote that Stereolab's \"socialist cocktail jazz schtick\" had become predictable and \"soulless\", and that despite the album's eclectic nature, \"it all sounds exactly the same.\" NME writer Johnny Cigarettes stated that the music was reminiscent of \"bad jazz and progressive rock\" and scathingly accused Stereolab of \"borrowing credibility by indulgently showing off their stylistic dexterity, thinking that odd time signatures and weird sounds are clever in their own right, (and) being deliberately obscure and unlistenable\". James Hunter of Rolling Stone dismissed the first five songs as uneventful and felt that only from \"Infinity Girl\" onward does the album capture the band's \"fashionable post-rock charm\".  Barry Walters of Spin found the more drone-oriented songs tepid but noted that \"the melodic bits are dreamier than ever\", concluding that the album would benefit from \"ruthless home-listener editing\".\n\nAmong more positive appraisals, Alternative Press remarked that \"few bands make sweetly psychedelic pop as enduring as (Stereolab) do.\" USA Today critic Edna Gundersen said that although \"ponderous drones such as 'Blue Milk' border on grating, the aggressively unorthodox band lapses into coherent melodies as effortlessly as Burt Bacharach.\" Elisabeth Vincentelli of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album \"takes time to work its charm, but it's well worth the effort.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Tim Sendra stated that while \"difficult at times, Cobra is Stereolab at their near best\", effectively balancing the band's experimental and pop sensibilities.Reviewing the album in 2019 for Uncut, Louis Pattison commented that in hindsight, \"its charms are more evident\". The same year, Tim Gane cited Cobra and Phases Group and its follow-up Sound-Dust (2001) as his favourite Stereolab albums in an interview with The Guardian: \"I like things that are sprawling and not identified really easily, not easy to digest but there's a lot of possibilities in them.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab/Cobra+and+Phases+Group+Play+Voltage+in+the+Milky+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night is the sixth studio album by English-French rock band Stereolab. It was released on 21 September 1999 and was issued by Duophonic Records and Elektra Records. The album was largely co-produced by Stereolab, John McEntire, and Jim O'Rourke.\n\nStereolab produced Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night with John McEntire, who had co-produced the band's previous two studio albums Emperor Tomato Ketchup (1996) and Dots and Loops (1997), and Jim O'Rourke. Assisted by McEntire and O'Rourke, Stereolab recorded the bulk of Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night between November 1998 and February 1999, at Wolf Studios in London. As band members Tim Gane and Lætitia Sadier were occupied with raising their infant son at the time, Stereolab opted to record in London instead of Chicago, where McEntire and O'Rourke were typically based. The only material on the album that does not date to these sessions is one section of the song \"Italian Shoes Continuum\"; this section was produced by Stereolab and Fulton Dingley and recorded in February 1998 at Blackwing Studios in London.\n\nCobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night was released on 21 September 1999 in the United States by Elektra Records, and on 27 September 1999 in the United Kingdom by Duophonic Records. The track \"The Free Design\" was previously released on 6 September 1999; it was issued as a single (on 7\" vinyl) and as an EP (on CD and 12\" vinyl).\n\nA remastered and expanded edition of Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night was released by Duophonic and Warp on 13 September 2019. Coinciding with the re-release, \"Come and Play in the Milky Night\" was issued as a digital single on 5 September 2019.\n\nCobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night was released to middling reviews from music critics. Pitchfork's Brent DiCrescenzo wrote that Stereolab's \"socialist cocktail jazz schtick\" had become predictable and \"soulless\", and that despite the album's eclectic nature, \"it all sounds exactly the same.\" NME writer Johnny Cigarettes stated that the music was reminiscent of \"bad jazz and progressive rock\" and scathingly accused Stereolab of \"borrowing credibility by indulgently showing off their stylistic dexterity, thinking that odd time signatures and weird sounds are clever in their own right, (and) being deliberately obscure and unlistenable\". James Hunter of Rolling Stone dismissed the first five songs as uneventful and felt that only from \"Infinity Girl\" onward does the album capture the band's \"fashionable post-rock charm\".  Barry Walters of Spin found the more drone-oriented songs tepid but noted that \"the melodic bits are dreamier than ever\", concluding that the album would benefit from \"ruthless home-listener editing\".\n\nAmong more positive appraisals, Alternative Press remarked that \"few bands make sweetly psychedelic pop as enduring as (Stereolab) do.\" USA Today critic Edna Gundersen said that although \"ponderous drones such as 'Blue Milk' border on grating, the aggressively unorthodox band lapses into coherent melodies as effortlessly as Burt Bacharach.\" Elisabeth Vincentelli of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album \"takes time to work its charm, but it's well worth the effort.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Tim Sendra stated that while \"difficult at times, Cobra is Stereolab at their near best\", effectively balancing the band's experimental and pop sensibilities.Reviewing the album in 2019 for Uncut, Louis Pattison commented that in hindsight, \"its charms are more evident\". The same year, Tim Gane cited Cobra and Phases Group and its follow-up Sound-Dust (2001) as his favourite Stereolab albums in an interview with The Guardian: \"I like things that are sprawling and not identified really easily, not easy to digest but there's a lot of possibilities in them.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab/Cobra+and+Phases+Group+Play+Voltage+in+the+Milky+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
