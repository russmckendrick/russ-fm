  "biography": "There are five artists using this name:\n\n1) Witch is a psychedelic rock / zamrock band formed in 1971 in Kitwe, Zambia. This five-piece electric band plays a strong electric African underground style. Tons of wah wah-fuzz guitar in every track, African style beats and vocals and all original songs.\n\n2) Witch is a group born in 2005 from a marriage of apparently contradictory influences. J Mascis, renown as the vocalist, songwriter and guitarist of Dinosaur Jr. (and Heavy Blanket, Upsidedown Cross) and his long time friend Dave Sweetapple (Sweet Apple, Cobra Verde) were interested in forming a hard rock band.  They found willing and able conspirators in Kyle Thomas (King Tuff) and Asa Irons, both also members of New England avant-folk outfit Feathers. This line-up mounts a mighty sonic tumult that harkens back to classic heavy metal sound of early 1970s outfits while still sounding modern in it's assault (and without falling into the ubiquitous \"Stoner Rock\" pigeonhole). Instead of clinging to his forte, the electric guitar, J Mascis instead plays his first instrument, the drums. Witch's trademark sound (particularly in their early work) shows obvious Black Sabbath influence and moments of Black Flag has also been noted for their sophomore effort, Paralyzed.\n\n3) Witch is a duo formed in 1980 by S. Joplin Babashoff and The Bird (later joined by guitarist Gloonis Botnik to create a trio). Over the past 26 years, Witch has recorded and released over 15 albums.\n\n4) Witch was an American heavy metal band formed in 1983 in Los Angeles, CA. They released the cult classic EP \"The Hex Is On\" in 1984. Members included Punky Peru (drums, vocals), Ronny Too (guitar, vocals), Peter Wabitt (lead vocals) and Jim Warmon (bass, vocals).\n\n5) Witch is a Japanese female singer / songwriter.
