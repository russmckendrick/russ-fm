As such, the band was a trio with Mould on guitar and voice, David Barbe (formerly of Mercyland) on bass, and Malcolm Travis (formerly with Zulus and Human Sexual Response) on drums. The band released three studio albums and a collection of live tracks and B-sides before breaking up in 1995.\n\nSUGAR (2) (슈가) were a 4 piece K-Pop girl group. The group began in 2001 with their first album Tell Me Why that included the two singles Sweet Love and Tell Me Why. Afterwards a year later they released their sophomore album Shine which was more successful than their first. Like other fellow Korean acts SUGAR emerged into the Japanese market with their first two singles GO THE DISTANCE and All My Loving after their second Korean album.\n\nThen soon afterwards Jung Eum, a member of Sugar decided to leave the group after their mini album Secret was released. Replacing her with Haleen, SUGAR moved on to release two more singles and their sophomore Japanese album. Then moving back to their roots SUGAR released their 3rd Korean album Sweet Lips one year after their mini album. Yet after this release Soo Jin announced that she would also be leaving SUGAR to concentrate on an acting career.\n\nWith the release of SUGAR's sophomore Japanese album COLORS 4 WISHES, each member decided to be a solo musician.

The group started in mid 2004, and in 2005 they released their first single. Unfortunately, 殊 (Koto) left the group on December 29th, 2007 after their live at Shibuya CLUB QUATTRO. In January Shingo joined the band as their new bassist. In March 2008 they released their first full album, SWEETEST.\n\nOnly four months after the departure of 殊 (Koto), a newsletter was sent to fans explaining that they were to disband. This was due to musical differences between the members and they felt they were unable to continue on as a band. They also announced the Sugar LAST ONEMAN TOUR , a three day three-man event to be held prior to their final one-man tour. May 8th featured lynch. and Sel’m, DuelJewel and MaitoreiA on May 9th, and Ｍｏｒａｎ and ｂｏｏｇｉｅｍａｎ on the last date.\n\nTheir final release, titled Letters, came out on the 20th of May and was sold in advance, on May 8th, at the LAST ONEMAN TOUR at Takadanobada AREA.
