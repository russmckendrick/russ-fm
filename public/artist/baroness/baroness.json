On May 14, 2012, the single \"Take My Bones Away\" from the new album was released over YouTube, along with an album teaser.\\n\\nBaroness released Yellow & Green on July 17, 2012 through Relapse.\\n\\nOn August 28, 2015 towards the end of a two-week tour in Europe they released the song \"Chlorine & Wine\" and announced that their new album Purple would be released December 18, 2015 on their own newly formed label Abraxan Hymns.\\n\\nPurple was recorded with Dave Fridmann at Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York.\\n\\nOn September 24, 2015, Baroness released the official music video for \"Chlorine & Wine\" and announced a North American small venue tour for the fall of 2015.\\n\\nOn November 15, 2015, the band released the first official single \"Shock Me\" from the forthcoming album Purple, which debuted on BBC Radio 1\\'s Rock Show with Daniel P. Carter.\\n\\nPurple\\'s track \"Shock Me\" was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 2017 Grammy Awards. \\n\\nGina Gleason joins Baroness in June of 2018 after Peter Adams departure.\\n\\nIn 2019 and 2023 Baroness released their fifth and sixth albums, \"Gold & Grey\" and \"STONE.\"  \\n\\nBaroness is: \\n Sebastian Thomson - drums\\n Nick Jost – bass\\n John Baizley  – guitars, vocals\\n Gina Gleason  – guitars\\n\\nDiscography\\n2004 First \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            (Hyperrealist Records) \\n2005 Second \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    (Hyperrealist Records)\\n2007 A Grey Sigh in a Flower Husk     (At a Loss Recordings)\\n(aka: Third), split CD with Unpersons \\n2007 Red Album \\t\\t\\t\\t            (Relapse Records) \\n2009 Blue Record \\t\\t\\t\\t    (Relapse Records)\\n2012 Yellow & Green                              (Relapse Records)\\n2015 Purple                                              (Abraxan Hymns)\\n2019 Gold & Grey                                    (Abraxan Hymns)\\n2023 STONE <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Baroness\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
