  "biography": "\"Greta Van Fleet\"   is an American rock band formed in 2012. The band members are Josh Kiszka, Jake Kiszka, Sam Kiszka, and Danny Wagner.\nThe band was formed in Frankenmuth, Michigan in 2012 by brothers Joshua \"Josh\" Kiszka, Samuel \"Sam\" Kiszka, Jacob \"Jake\" Kiszka and Kyle Hauck. Hauck subsequently left the band in October 2013 and was replaced by Daniel \"Danny\" Wagner the same year. The band name was created when one of its members heard a relative mention Gretna Van Fleet, a resident of Frankenmuth; the variation on her name is used with her blessing.",

Their \"From The Fires\" EP, released in 2017, won \"Best Rock Album\" at the 61st Grammy Awards.\\n\\nTheir 3rd studio album, \"Starcatcher\" (2023) follows GRETA VAN FLEET\\'s second  album  \"The Battle At Garden\\'s Gate\", released in 2021 to extensive chart and critical success.

With \"Starcatcher\" the band aims to capture that energy in the recording studio.\\n\\nThe band\\'s heavy rock sound is influenced by the work of Led Zeppelin and many other rock and blues acts, with lead vocalist Josh Kiszka having a voice that has been compared to Robert Plant\\'s \"husky howl.\\n\\nGreta Van Fleet\\'s music has been categorized as hard rock and blues rock. Although all four members bonded over blues, each does have their own music tastes; Jake gravitates towards rock and roll, Sam likes jazz, Danny prefers folk, and Josh likes world music. Sam stated that \"It\\'s not like we set out to be a rock and roll band, it\\'s just that sound that comes out [when] we get together and play.\" Songwriting is done by the band as a whole after one of the four members finds the concept for a song. Danny said a lot of their songs are first written in a \"folk set up\" before evolving into something else.\\n\\nGreta Van Fleet are often compared to Led Zeppelin. Jake related that he \"... went through a year of really intensely studying what [Jimmy] Page did ...\", but he has studied other virtuoso rock guitarists in a similar manner, specifically mentioning Pete Townshend. Likewise, on his voice being compared to Robert Plant\\'s, Josh said that Plant has certainly been an influence, \"though it\\'s not what I was going for.\" Stating that he did not even know who Led Zeppelin was until high school, he explained that his singing style came out naturally one day while struggling to be heard over the rest of the band. In a March 2018 interview, Plant cited Greta Van Fleet as one of his favorite young bands, saying \"they are Led Zeppelin I\" and describing Josh as \"a beautiful little singer.\"\\n\\nSome of Jake\\'s guitar influences include John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Bert Jansch, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards. Some of the drummers that inspired Danny are Carmine Appice, John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell and Michael Shrieve. Sam\\'s favorite bass player is Motown session bassist James Jamerson. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Greta+Van+Fleet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In a March 2018 interview, Plant cited Greta Van Fleet as one of his favorite young bands, saying \"they are Led Zeppelin I\" and describing Josh as \"a beautiful little singer.\"\\n\\nSome of Jake\\'s guitar influences include John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Bert Jansch, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards.
