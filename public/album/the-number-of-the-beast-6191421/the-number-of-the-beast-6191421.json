      "biography": "Iron Maiden is an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. While fluid in the early years of the band, the lineup for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. The band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four EPs and seven compilations. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums. Two electronic games have been released with Iron Maiden soundtracks, and the band's music is featured in a number of other video games.\n\nAs pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several lineup changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980's eponymous debut album, 1981's Killers, 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death, 1986's Somewhere in Time, 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, 1990's No Prayer for the Dying and 1992's Fear of the Dark. In 1982, the band released The Number of the Beast – its first album with Bruce Dickinson, who replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer – which was a turning point in their career, helping establish them as one of heavy metal's most important artists. The Number of the Beast is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nSince the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours. Released in 2006, A Matter of Life and Death, their 14th studio album, reached top sales in dozens of countries, initiating the series of Iron Maiden's highest-ranked albums. Their 2010 album, The Final Frontier, peaked at No. 1 in 28 countries and received widespread critical acclaim. Their 16th studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success, debuting at No. 1 in the album charts of 24 countries with physical sales and summary in 43 territories with physical and digital sales. Most recently, their 17th studio album, Senjutsu, was released on 3 September 2021 and eventually reached No. 1 in 27 countries.\n\nIron Maiden have sold over 130 million copies of their albums worldwide, despite minimal radio and mainstream media support. The band's catalogue has sold over 200 million copies worldwide, including albums, singles, compilations and videos. By 2022, their releases have been certified Silver, Gold and Platinum around 600 times worldwide. Iron Maiden have become one of the most influential and revered rock bands of all time, and is credited with influencing countless bands and genres. Critics have stated that the band elevated heavy metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist. The band is also hailed as one of the greatest live acts of all time.\n\nThe band and its members have received multiple industry awards, including the Grammy Awards and its equivalents in other countries. Other accolades the band has received include Brit Awards, Silver Clef Award, Nordoff-Robbins Award, Ivor Novello Awards, Juno Awards, Guinness Book of World Records, Public Choice International, Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards, ECHO Awards, Top.HR Music Awards, Žebřík Music Awards, honorary doctorates, State Prizes, sales recognition, marketing achievements recognition awards, charity and sport awards among many others. Iron Maiden were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk, BPI Hall of Fame and Kerrang! Hall of Fame. The band is also a part of permanent exhibitions of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, British Music Experience, Rock in Rio Wall of Fame and Wacken Open Air Hall of Fame. Iron Maiden were honoured by Royal Mail UK with dedicated postal stamps and cards. The band as 'bona fide' rock legends belongs to an elitarian circle of British iconic bands honoured with an unique range of stamps, including The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Queen and Iron Maiden as the fifth one.\n\nIron Maiden's lyrics cover such topics as history, literature, war, mythology, society and religion. Many of their songs are based on history, classic literature and film. As of October 2019, the band have played some 2500 live shows, performing for tens of millions of fans. For over 40 years, the musicians have been supported by their famous mascot, \"Eddie\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, videos and merchandise. Originally designed by Derek Riggs, Eddie became the main attraction of Iron Maiden live shows, which feature theatrical elements like coloured backdrops, inflatables, pyrotechnics, elaborate lighting rigs, props and stage sets.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden\n\nStudio albums\nIron Maiden (1980)\nKillers (1981)\nThe Number of the Beast (1982)\nPiece of Mind (1983)\nPowerslave (1984)\nSomewhere in Time (1986)\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)\nNo Prayer for the Dying (1990)\nFear of the Dark (1992)\nThe X Factor (1995)\nVirtual XI (1998)\nBrave New World (2000)\nDance of Death (2003)\nA Matter of Life and Death (2006)\nThe Final Frontier (2010)\nThe Book of Souls (2015)\nSenjutsu (2021) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The title track and “Run to the Hills” are crowd-pleasers while “Children of the Damned\", “The Prisoner\" and “Hallowed Be Thy Name” are exemplary displays of the group’s instrumental prowess, its uncanny knack for writing accessible riffs, and a perfect launchpad for Dickinson’s commanding operatic vocal style.",

The title track and “Run to the Hills” are crowd-pleasers while “Children of the Damned\", “The Prisoner\" and “Hallowed Be Thy Name” are exemplary displays of the group’s instrumental prowess, its uncanny knack for writing accessible riffs, and a perfect launchpad for Dickinson’s commanding operatic vocal style."

            "content": "The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The album was released on March 29, 1982 through EMI. This was the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson in Iron Maiden. Number of the Beast has been cited as one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all-time, and is widely acknowledged as one of the best and most iconic albums of the genre.\n\nThe Number of the Beast also cemented Iron Maiden as one of \"the biggest metal bands on the planet\".\n\nOf all the songs in the album, \"The Number of the Beast\", \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" remain on the set lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours, with the latter two often used to close a show. All three songs have been released as singles in various forms.\n\nThe Beast on the Road was the tour supporting the album.\n\n\n History\nThe Number of the Beast marked Bruce Dickinson's debut with the band. Though the recording process was successful, it was plagued with bizarre events - during the making of the album, record producer Martin Birch had been in an accident and crashed his car into one driven by a \"religious nutter\" on a rainy Sunday evening. When he got his car back from the mechanic the bill came back in the exact amount of £666.66. Birch, \"terrified\", demanded the bill be rounded up to £667. Also, the title track reached number 18 in the UK charts - the sum of three sixes. Other stories about various strange occurrences at the recording studio have circulated, such as equipment randomly breaking down and lights turning off and on by themselves.\n\nSince this album (and its tour, Beast on the Road), \"The Beast\" has become something of a nickname for the band and possibly Eddie, as suggested by albums such as Best of the Beast (which featured a 'best of Eddie' mural on the cover), Beast over Hammersmith, and the DVD Visions of the Beast.\n\nThis album is the only one to feature songwriting by drummer Clive Burr. This is one of several reasons why the album was so different from previous ones other than the obvious change in lead singer. It was the first album with writing by Adrian Smith (see below track listing for details), and the first to feature writing by the 'new' Steve Harris (his older style had been written for different musicians, and in a different time) - the entire writing system was different. However, it is one of the few albums not to feature a Dave Murray song, and the first album not to feature an instrumental.\n\n\nReception\nIt was widely panned by mainstream media upon its release, including Rolling Stone, who claimed that it \"blusters along aimlessly, proving again that bad music is hell.\"\n\nIt was also panned by social conservatives, especially in America. Due to its title, Iron Maiden was called a \"Satanic band\" in the US. Their Beast on the Road tour was marred by boycotts and protests.\n\nHowever, as time passed by, The Number of the Beast became one of the most critically acclaimed metal albums of all time, and was more accepted after the band became more mainstream.\n\nAllmusic said: \"The Number of the Beast is quite simply one of the best heavy metal albums ever released.\"\n\nThe album was ranked number 17 on Guitar World's list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 100 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever, and a year later the same magazine named it as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. The BBC made a documentary of this album in their Classic Albums series.\n\nIGN named it the third greatest heavy metal album of all time.\n\nMetal-Rules.com named this the second greatest heavy metal album of all time.\n\nThe album is also a part of EMI's \"Albums That Shaped Rock History\" series.\n\n\nAlbum artwork\nThe album was also the centre of controversy, particularly in America, due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Satan being controlled by Eddie. This cover art was originally intended for an earlier single, \"Purgatory\", but the band felt the cover was too high of caliber for just a single and a less complex image was used for the single instead. The title track, \"Number of the Beast\", was said not be a satanic song was actually instead inspired by bass player Steve Harris's nightmares about dabbling in Satanism. The album's cover art has been parodied several times - by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover art of their 1999 album Bigger Than the Devil, and on a T-shirt by underground New York Hip Hop Label Uncle Howie Records *Streetwear brand Diamond Supply Co. parodied the album cover for a shirt in their line. Nick Tershay, founder of Diamond is reported as having had to pay $50,000 due to the parody being too close to the original art work.\n\nThe original 1982 artwork includes a light blue sky in the background; this was a mistake by the printers of the album cover, and was later rectified and became black when the album was remastered for compact disc in 1998.\n\n\n Lyrical themes\nWhile the title track was thought by many to be an assumption Iron Maiden were Satanists, in fact the song was inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the film Damien: Omen II late at night. While he was quite scared of the Satanic images he saw in his nightmare, he also felt them amusing, and after that, he obtained the idea for the song, and also for the title of the album.\n\n\n\"Children of the Damned\" is based on the films Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned, which in turn were adapted from the novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham. On a recent \"Bruce Dickinson Rock Show\" on BBC Radio 6, Dickinson told Ronnie James Dio that Children of the Damned was inspired by \"Children of the Sea\".\n\n\"The Prisoner\" was inspired by the British TV show of the same name, and features dialogue from its title sequence. Rod Smallwood had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the dialogue for the song. According to witnesses the usually calm Smallwood was completely star struck during the conversation. McGoohan was reported to have said \"What did you say the name was? Iron Maiden? Do it.\" Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series, \"Back in the Village\" from Powerslave.\n\n\"22 Acacia Avenue\" is the second song in the \"Charlotte the Harlot\" saga.\n\nThe title track opens with a spoken introduction which draws heavily from the King James Version of Revelation 13:18, and is apparently inspired by Tam o' Shanter by Robert Burns. Barry Clayton is the name of the actor who speaks those opening lines on the album.\n\n\nClassic Albums\n \nThe cover for DVD, Classic Albums: The Number of the Beast.The making of the album was released as a video on December 4, 2001 through Eagle Visions, as part of the documentary series, Classic Albums.\n\n\nThe video was directed by Tim Kirkby and featured cuts from the title track, \"Children of the Damned\", \"Run to the Hills\", and \"The Prisoner\". In addition, extended interviews and live footage of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" —recorded during the band's performance at the Rock in Rio festval in 2001— were included.\n\nThe video reached number 9 on the Norwegian DVD Charts, and was certifed Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\n\nIt was released in DVD, VHS and UMD formats, and featured subtitles in six different languages, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French.\n\n Appearance in media\nOn October 24, 2002, progressive metal outfit Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety at La Mutualite in Paris, France. The performance was recorded and has been released through the band's YtseJam Records label.\n\n\"Run To The Hills\" was covered on the all-star tribute album Numbers From The Beast, featuring vocalist Robin McAuley, guitarists Michael Schenker and Pete Fletcher, bassist Tony Franklin, and drummer Brian Tichy.

      "wiki_content": "The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The album was released on March 29, 1982 through EMI. This was the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson in Iron Maiden. Number of the Beast has been cited as one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all-time, and is widely acknowledged as one of the best and most iconic albums of the genre.\n\nThe Number of the Beast also cemented Iron Maiden as one of \"the biggest metal bands on the planet\".\n\nOf all the songs in the album, \"The Number of the Beast\", \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" remain on the set lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours, with the latter two often used to close a show. All three songs have been released as singles in various forms.\n\nThe Beast on the Road was the tour supporting the album.\n\n\n History\nThe Number of the Beast marked Bruce Dickinson's debut with the band. Though the recording process was successful, it was plagued with bizarre events - during the making of the album, record producer Martin Birch had been in an accident and crashed his car into one driven by a \"religious nutter\" on a rainy Sunday evening. When he got his car back from the mechanic the bill came back in the exact amount of £666.66. Birch, \"terrified\", demanded the bill be rounded up to £667. Also, the title track reached number 18 in the UK charts - the sum of three sixes. Other stories about various strange occurrences at the recording studio have circulated, such as equipment randomly breaking down and lights turning off and on by themselves.\n\nSince this album (and its tour, Beast on the Road), \"The Beast\" has become something of a nickname for the band and possibly Eddie, as suggested by albums such as Best of the Beast (which featured a 'best of Eddie' mural on the cover), Beast over Hammersmith, and the DVD Visions of the Beast.\n\nThis album is the only one to feature songwriting by drummer Clive Burr. This is one of several reasons why the album was so different from previous ones other than the obvious change in lead singer. It was the first album with writing by Adrian Smith (see below track listing for details), and the first to feature writing by the 'new' Steve Harris (his older style had been written for different musicians, and in a different time) - the entire writing system was different. However, it is one of the few albums not to feature a Dave Murray song, and the first album not to feature an instrumental.\n\n\nReception\nIt was widely panned by mainstream media upon its release, including Rolling Stone, who claimed that it \"blusters along aimlessly, proving again that bad music is hell.\"\n\nIt was also panned by social conservatives, especially in America. Due to its title, Iron Maiden was called a \"Satanic band\" in the US. Their Beast on the Road tour was marred by boycotts and protests.\n\nHowever, as time passed by, The Number of the Beast became one of the most critically acclaimed metal albums of all time, and was more accepted after the band became more mainstream.\n\nAllmusic said: \"The Number of the Beast is quite simply one of the best heavy metal albums ever released.\"\n\nThe album was ranked number 17 on Guitar World's list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 100 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever, and a year later the same magazine named it as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. The BBC made a documentary of this album in their Classic Albums series.\n\nIGN named it the third greatest heavy metal album of all time.\n\nMetal-Rules.com named this the second greatest heavy metal album of all time.\n\nThe album is also a part of EMI's \"Albums That Shaped Rock History\" series.\n\n\nAlbum artwork\nThe album was also the centre of controversy, particularly in America, due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Satan being controlled by Eddie. This cover art was originally intended for an earlier single, \"Purgatory\", but the band felt the cover was too high of caliber for just a single and a less complex image was used for the single instead. The title track, \"Number of the Beast\", was said not be a satanic song was actually instead inspired by bass player Steve Harris's nightmares about dabbling in Satanism. The album's cover art has been parodied several times - by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover art of their 1999 album Bigger Than the Devil, and on a T-shirt by underground New York Hip Hop Label Uncle Howie Records *Streetwear brand Diamond Supply Co. parodied the album cover for a shirt in their line. Nick Tershay, founder of Diamond is reported as having had to pay $50,000 due to the parody being too close to the original art work.\n\nThe original 1982 artwork includes a light blue sky in the background; this was a mistake by the printers of the album cover, and was later rectified and became black when the album was remastered for compact disc in 1998.\n\n\n Lyrical themes\nWhile the title track was thought by many to be an assumption Iron Maiden were Satanists, in fact the song was inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the film Damien: Omen II late at night. While he was quite scared of the Satanic images he saw in his nightmare, he also felt them amusing, and after that, he obtained the idea for the song, and also for the title of the album.\n\n\n\"Children of the Damned\" is based on the films Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned, which in turn were adapted from the novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham. On a recent \"Bruce Dickinson Rock Show\" on BBC Radio 6, Dickinson told Ronnie James Dio that Children of the Damned was inspired by \"Children of the Sea\".\n\n\"The Prisoner\" was inspired by the British TV show of the same name, and features dialogue from its title sequence. Rod Smallwood had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the dialogue for the song. According to witnesses the usually calm Smallwood was completely star struck during the conversation. McGoohan was reported to have said \"What did you say the name was? Iron Maiden? Do it.\" Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series, \"Back in the Village\" from Powerslave.\n\n\"22 Acacia Avenue\" is the second song in the \"Charlotte the Harlot\" saga.\n\nThe title track opens with a spoken introduction which draws heavily from the King James Version of Revelation 13:18, and is apparently inspired by Tam o' Shanter by Robert Burns. Barry Clayton is the name of the actor who speaks those opening lines on the album.\n\n\nClassic Albums\n \nThe cover for DVD, Classic Albums: The Number of the Beast.The making of the album was released as a video on December 4, 2001 through Eagle Visions, as part of the documentary series, Classic Albums.\n\n\nThe video was directed by Tim Kirkby and featured cuts from the title track, \"Children of the Damned\", \"Run to the Hills\", and \"The Prisoner\". In addition, extended interviews and live footage of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" —recorded during the band's performance at the Rock in Rio festval in 2001— were included.\n\nThe video reached number 9 on the Norwegian DVD Charts, and was certifed Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\n\nIt was released in DVD, VHS and UMD formats, and featured subtitles in six different languages, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French.\n\n Appearance in media\nOn October 24, 2002, progressive metal outfit Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety at La Mutualite in Paris, France. The performance was recorded and has been released through the band's YtseJam Records label.\n\n\"Run To The Hills\" was covered on the all-star tribute album Numbers From The Beast, featuring vocalist Robin McAuley, guitarists Michael Schenker and Pete Fletcher, bassist Tony Franklin, and drummer Brian Tichy.
