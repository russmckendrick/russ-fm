  "biography": "James Brown & The Famous Flames was an American rhythm and blues, soul vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown first began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first appearance in a professional recording, \"Please, Please, Please\", in 1956.\n\nOn hit songs such as \"Try Me\", \"Bewildered\", \"Think\", \"I Don't Mind\", and \"I'll Go Crazy\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned singing, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show[2] (1964) and Ski Party.[3] Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown.[4] On their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, they are described as \"a group of singers, performers and dancers that created the complementary elements of one of the greatest stage shows of all time.\"[5] As of 2020, The Famous Flames were also inducted into The National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Famous Flames is sometimes erroneously identified as James Brown's \"band\",[8] a confusion partly fostered by their record companies' inconsistent labeling credit practices. Although members of the group did play instruments in some of their earliest shows and recordings, by 1959 Brown had hired a touring band and from that point on, the Flames contributed primarily as backing vocalists and dancers.[9] The band was billed separately as the James Brown Band, and later as the James Brown Orchestra. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/James+Brown+&+The+Famous+Flames\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
