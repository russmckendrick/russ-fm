      "biography": "Paul Weller (born 25 May 1958) is an English singer / songwriter and leader of two successful bands: The Jam and The Style Council. In England, he is recognized as something of a national institution yet, because much of his songwriting is rooted in English culture, he has remained essentially a national, rather than an international, star.  \n\nWellers 17th studio album \"66\" is set to be released on 24 May 2024. The title is a reference to his 66th birthday, just a day after the release.\n\nBorn John William Weller in Stanley Road, Woking, he was also a central figure in the Mod revival. As the leader of the Jam, Paul Weller fronted the most popular British band of the punk era, influencing legions of English rockers that ranged from his mod-revival contemporaries to the Smiths in the '80s and Oasis in the '90s. During the final days of the Jam, he developed a fascination with Motown and soul, which led him to form the sophisti-pop group the Style Council in 1983. As the Style Council's career progressed, Weller's interest in soul developed into an infatuation with jazz-pop and house music, which eventually led to gradual erosion of his audience — by 1990, he couldn't get a record contract in the UK, where he had previously been worshipped as a demi-god. As a solo artist, Weller returned to soul music as an inspiration, cutting it with the progressive, hippie tendencies of Traffic. Weller's solo records were more organic and rootsier than the Style Council, which helped him regain his popularity within Britain. By the mid-'90s, he had released three successful albums which were both critically-acclaimed and massively popular in England, where contemporary bands like Ocean Colour Scene were citing him as an influence. Just as importantly, many observers, while occasionally criticizing the trad-rock nature of his music, acknowledged that Weller was one of the few rock veterans that had managed to stay vital within the second decade of his career. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Weller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He remained principal conductor until 1950, when Malcolm Sargent took over (holding the post until 1957). Other principal conductors have included Antal Doráti (1962-66), Colin Davis (1967-71), Pierre Boulez (1971-75), Gennady Rozhdestvensky (1978-81) and Andrew Davis (no relation to Colin) who held from the post from 1989 until he was succeeded by Leonard Slatkin in 2000. Also in 2000, the orchestra appointed its first Associate Composer, Mark-Anthony Turnage. John Adams became the BBC Symphony Orchestra's Artist in Association in June 2003. Leonard Slatkin's final concert as Chief Conductor was the Last Night of the Proms 2004. In early 2005 it was announced that the Czech conductor, Jiří Bělohlávek would become Chief Conductor from the first night of The Proms, 2006.\n\nAs well as these principal conductors, the orchestra has had several notable guest conductors, including Arturo Toscanini. The current Principal Guest Conductor is David Robertson who took on the role in October 2005 in succession from Jukka-Pekka Saraste, who stepped-down at the end of August 2005.\n\nThe orchestra frequently commissions works by contemporary composers, and is a particular champion of new British works. Harrison Birtwistle's Earth Dances, Pierre Boulez' Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna and John Tavener's The Protecting Veil were all BBC commissions first played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe orchestra plays a prominent role in The Proms, the annual season of concerts played at the Royal Albert Hall. It plays on both the first and last nights of the season.\n\nThe other BBC orchestras are the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra.\n\nOther London-based orchestras include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Philharmonia and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/BBC+Symphony+Orchestra\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
