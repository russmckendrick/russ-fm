  "biography": "Polly Jean \"PJ\" Harvey, born 9 October 1969, is an English singer-songwriter. She is known primarily as a vocalist and guitarist, and is skilled in playing multiple instruments.\n\nHarvey started her music career in 1988 by joining the local band Automatic Dlamini as a vocalist, guitarist, and saxophonist. John Parish, the band's frontman, has remained a long-term collaborator with her. In 1991, she formed a trio called PJ Harvey, marking the beginning of her career under that name. The trio released two studio albums, \"Dry\" (1992) and \"Rid of Me\" (1993), before disbanding. Afterward, Harvey pursued a solo career, releasing ten additional studio albums since 1995. She has worked with various musicians, including Parish, former bandmate Rob Ellis, Mick Harvey, and Eric Drew Feldman, and has collaborated extensively with producer Flood.\n\nHarvey has received several awards and nominations throughout her career. She won the Mercury Prize twice, for the albums \"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\" (2000) and \"Let England Shake\" (2011), making her the only artist to have won the prize twice. She has also been nominated for a BAFTA Award, eight Brit Awards, eight Grammy Awards, and two additional Mercury Prizes. Rolling Stone recognized her with awards for Best New Artist and Best Singer-Songwriter in 1992, and Artist of the Year in 1995. She received the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the NME Awards. In 2013, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for her contributions to music.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Harvey\n\nStudio albums\nDry (1992)\nRid of Me (1993)\nTo Bring You My Love (1995)\nIs This Desire?
