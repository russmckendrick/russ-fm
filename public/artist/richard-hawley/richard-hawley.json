  "biography": "Richard Willis Hawley (born 17 January 1967, Sheffield, England) is an English guitarist, singer-songwriter and producer. After his first band Treebound Story (formed while he was still at school) broke up, Hawley found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990s. After that group broke up in 2000, he later joined the band Pulp, led by his friend Jarvis Cocker, for a short time. As a solo musician, Hawley has released seven studio albums.\nImpressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey (a former classmate from Hucklow Middle School) urged Hawley to record his first eponymous mini-album, released in 2000. In 2001, Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges, named after a suburb of the city that the young Hawley had seen on the destination board of a bus. The NME called Lowedges the \"first great album of 2003\" and it topped an end-of-the-year poll held by Virgin Radio. Critical praise was widespread, leading many big names such as Coldplay, Radiohead and R.E.M. to enthuse about Hawley's work.\nAfter the demise of Setanta Records in 2004, Hawley eventually signed to Mute Records, a division of EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Coles Corner, Hawley's fourth release, until September 2005. Again, Hawley mined the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Coles Corner eventually gained a nomination for the Mercury Prize in 2006. Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys, whose debut album won the prize, famously exclaimed \"Someone call 999, Richard Hawley's been robbed!\"\nHawley's 2007 album Lady's Bridge (again named with a Sheffield reference - Lady's Bridge is in the centre of Sheffield) was released in the United Kingdom on 20 August 2007. He performed a 16-date tour during September 2007 to promote the album. Merchandising on the tour included the usual t-shirts and posters, but also special edition bottles of Sheffield-made Henderson's Relish. The bottles featured the album's artwork, and a note that it gave extra flavour to meat, fish, soups, pies, casseroles and vegetables. Hawley previously used the relish to promote Coles Corner.\nOn 14 January 2008, Hawley was nominated for his first solo Brit Award for Best British Male Performer. Hawley was a headlining act at the 2008 Festival Internacional de BenicÃ ssim in Spain. Hawley claimed that it was the best festival audience he had ever played to. Hawley recently produced, with Colin Elliot, and contributed two songs to the album Made in Sheffield, a compilation of songs by Sheffield-based songwriters for Tony Christie.\nTruelove's Gutter, Richard's sixth studio album, was released on Mute Records on 21 September 2009. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.\nHis song \"Don't Get Hung Up In Your Soul\" was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week for 17 November 2009. and \"Open Up Your Door\" currently features as the soundtrack song to the Häagen-Dazs ice cream TV commercial in the UK.\nHawley's track \"Tonight The Streets Are Ours\" was chosen as the title track for the Oscar nominated 2010 Banksy film Exit Through the Gift Shop which premièred at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010.\n\"You And I\" by Richard Hawley and The Death Ramps (AKA The Arctic Monkeys), has been released as the B-Side of The Arctic Monkeys' single \"Black Treacle\" on 23 January 2012.\n\"Standing at the Sky's Edge\" the 7th Hawley album was released in the UK on 7 May 2012 on the Parlophone record label. The first single, \"Leave Your Body Behind You\" is also available for download and will form part of the Singles Club releases Hawley intends for the coming months.",

Hawley initially found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990\\'s, and formerly Treebound Story. When a drug-filled torpor after an extensive tour of America brought the band to the brink of extinction in 1997, Hawley was asked to play with Pulp by his close friend and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. \"They saved my life,\" Hawley later recalled, \"I was going mental with drink and drugs.\" The subsequent world tour in support of Pulp\\'s album This Is Hardcore left Hawley emotionally and physically drained on his return to his home city. During this time, he even considered leaving the music industry altogether.\\n\\nIt was an encounter at Hawley\\'s Sheffield home that led the longtime collaborator out of the shadows. Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp\\'s Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey urged Hawley to head into the studio and begin work on his first solo release. 2000\\'s eponymous mini album encouraged Hawley to return to the studio once more. In 2001 Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges, another Sheffield reference, this time to the curiously named suburb of the city that had so entranced the young Hawley when he had seen it on the destination board of a bus. NME called Lowedges the \"first great album of 2003\" and it topped an end of year poll held by Virgin Radio.\\n\\nIn 2004 Hawley signed to Mute Records, a division of the giant EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Cole\\'s Corner, Hawley\\'s fourth release, until September 2005. Again Hawley mines the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Cole\\'s Corner eventually gained a nomination for the acclaimed Mercury Prize in 2006.\\n\\nHawley\\'s work as a session musician and producer remains in high demand. After contributing towards her eponymous 2004 release, Hawley also supported Nancy Sinatra on her European tour in 2005. In the past, Hawley has also worked with artists as diverse as New York\\'s A Girl Called Eddy, All Saints (he played the guitar solo on their cover of \"Under the Bridge\"), Nellee Hooper\\'s soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann\\'s Romeo and Juliet and with Jarvis Cocker\\'s Relaxed Muscle project.\\n\\nAside from his solo and session work, Hawley occasionally tours with The Feral Cats, a side project that enables him to explore his interest in rockabilly music.\\n\\nPossibly due to his aforementioned rockabilly interest, Hawley once auditioned for the role as guitarist in the rockabilly-inclined Morrissey\\'s band.\\n\\nFiercely proud of his working class upbringing, Hawley recently described himself as \"jurassic labour\" in response to a question about the New Labour project. He lives in Sheffield, with his wife and children and is an avid Sheffield Wednesday supporter.\\n\\nIn 2007 Hawley released a new studio album, Lady\\'s Bridge (the title refers to a bridge Hawley regulary crosses in his native Sheffield) again to much critical acclaim.\\n\\nHawley\\'s album Truelove\\'s Gutter was released in September 2009 and followed that October by a UK nationwide tour. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.\\n\\nFollowing the success of his award-winning, hugely acclaimed 2009 album \\'Truelove\\'s Gutter\\', Richard Hawley will release his sixth studio album, \\'Standing At The Sky\\'s Edge\\' - his first for new label Parlophone - on 7th May.\\n\\nRecorded at Sheffield\\'s Yellow Arch Studio in 2011, \\'Standing At The Sky\\'s Edge\\' marks a seismic shift in direction for Hawley. The album is a euphoric, sonic assault on the senses, channelling elements of psychedelia, space rock and ragas with heavy riffs and raw, visceral guitar solos - as well as more familiar, tender moments - which will surprise Hawley\\'s fans and peers alike.\\nwww.richardhawley.co.uk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Hawley initially found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990\\'s, and formerly Treebound Story. When a drug-filled torpor after an extensive tour of America brought the band to the brink of extinction in 1997, Hawley was asked to play with Pulp by his close friend and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. \"They saved my life,\" Hawley later recalled, \"I was going mental with drink and drugs.\" The subsequent world tour in support of Pulp\\'s album This Is Hardcore left Hawley emotionally and physically drained on his return to his home city. During this time, he even considered leaving the music industry altogether.\\n\\nIt was an encounter at Hawley\\'s Sheffield home that led the longtime collaborator out of the shadows. Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp\\'s Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey urged Hawley to head into the studio and begin work on his first solo release. 2000\\'s eponymous mini album encouraged Hawley to return to the studio once more. In 2001 Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges, another Sheffield reference, this time to the curiously named suburb of the city that had so entranced the young Hawley when he had seen it on the destination board of a bus. NME called Lowedges the \"first great album of 2003\" and it topped an end of year poll held by Virgin Radio.\\n\\nIn 2004 Hawley signed to Mute Records, a division of the giant EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Cole\\'s Corner, Hawley\\'s fourth release, until September 2005. Again Hawley mines the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Cole\\'s Corner eventually gained a nomination for the acclaimed Mercury Prize in 2006.\\n\\nHawley\\'s work as a session musician and producer remains in high demand. After contributing towards her eponymous 2004 release, Hawley also supported Nancy Sinatra on her European tour in 2005. In the past, Hawley has also worked with artists as diverse as New York\\'s A Girl Called Eddy, All Saints (he played the guitar solo on their cover of \"Under the Bridge\"), Nellee Hooper\\'s soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann\\'s Romeo and Juliet and with Jarvis Cocker\\'s Relaxed Muscle project.\\n\\nAside from his solo and session work, Hawley occasionally tours with The Feral Cats, a side project that enables him to explore his interest in rockabilly music.\\n\\nPossibly due to his aforementioned rockabilly interest, Hawley once auditioned for the role as guitarist in the rockabilly-inclined Morrissey\\'s band.\\n\\nFiercely proud of his working class upbringing, Hawley recently described himself as \"jurassic labour\" in response to a question about the New Labour project. He lives in Sheffield, with his wife and children and is an avid Sheffield Wednesday supporter.\\n\\nIn 2007 Hawley released a new studio album, Lady\\'s Bridge (the title refers to a bridge Hawley regulary crosses in his native Sheffield) again to much critical acclaim.\\n\\nHawley\\'s album Truelove\\'s Gutter was released in September 2009 and followed that October by a UK nationwide tour. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.\\n\\nFollowing the success of his award-winning, hugely acclaimed 2009 album \\'Truelove\\'s Gutter\\', Richard Hawley will release his sixth studio album, \\'Standing At The Sky\\'s Edge\\' - his first for new label Parlophone - on 7th May.\\n\\nRecorded at Sheffield\\'s Yellow Arch Studio in 2011, \\'Standing At The Sky\\'s Edge\\' marks a seismic shift in direction for Hawley. The album is a euphoric, sonic assault on the senses, channelling elements of psychedelia, space rock and ragas with heavy riffs and raw, visceral guitar solos - as well as more familiar, tender moments - which will surprise Hawley\\'s fans and peers alike.\\nwww.richardhawley.co.uk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After his first band Treebound Story (formed while he was still at school) broke up, Hawley found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990s. After that group broke up in 2000, he later joined the band Pulp, led by his friend Jarvis Cocker, for a short time. As a solo musician, Hawley has released seven studio albums.\nImpressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey (a former classmate from Hucklow Middle School) urged Hawley to record his first eponymous mini-album, released in 2000. In 2001, Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales.

The NME called Lowedges the \"first great album of 2003\" and it topped an end-of-the-year poll held by Virgin Radio. Critical praise was widespread, leading many big names such as Coldplay, Radiohead and R.E.M. to enthuse about Hawley's work.\nAfter the demise of Setanta Records in 2004, Hawley eventually signed to Mute Records, a division of EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Coles Corner, Hawley's fourth release, until September 2005. Again, Hawley mined the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Coles Corner eventually gained a nomination for the Mercury Prize in 2006. Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys, whose debut album won the prize, famously exclaimed \"Someone call 999, Richard Hawley's been robbed!\"\nHawley's 2007 album Lady's Bridge (again named with a Sheffield reference - Lady's Bridge is in the centre of Sheffield) was released in the United Kingdom on 20 August 2007. He performed a 16-date tour during September 2007 to promote the album. Merchandising on the tour included the usual t-shirts and posters, but also special edition bottles of Sheffield-made Henderson's Relish. The bottles featured the album's artwork, and a note that it gave extra flavour to meat, fish, soups, pies, casseroles and vegetables. Hawley previously used the relish to promote Coles Corner.\nOn 14 January 2008, Hawley was nominated for his first solo Brit Award for Best British Male Performer. Hawley was a headlining act at the 2008 Festival Internacional de BenicÃ ssim in Spain. Hawley claimed that it was the best festival audience he had ever played to. Hawley recently produced, with Colin Elliot, and contributed two songs to the album Made in Sheffield, a compilation of songs by Sheffield-based songwriters for Tony Christie.\nTruelove's Gutter, Richard's sixth studio album, was released on Mute Records on 21 September 2009. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.\nHis song \"Don't Get Hung Up In Your Soul\" was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week for 17 November 2009. and \"Open Up Your Door\" currently features as the soundtrack song to the Häagen-Dazs ice cream TV commercial in the UK.\nHawley's track \"Tonight The Streets Are Ours\" was chosen as the title track for the Oscar nominated 2010 Banksy film Exit Through the Gift Shop which premièred at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010.\n\"You And I\" by Richard Hawley and The Death Ramps (AKA The Arctic Monkeys), has been released as the B-Side of The Arctic Monkeys' single \"Black Treacle\" on 23 January 2012.\n\"Standing at the Sky's Edge\" the 7th Hawley album was released in the UK on 7 May 2012 on the Parlophone record label. The first single, \"Leave Your Body Behind You\" is also available for download and will form part of the Singles Club releases Hawley intends for the coming months.",
      "biography_es": "Richard Willis Hawley (17 de enero de 1967 en Sheffield, Inglaterra), es un guitarrista, cantautor y productor inglés. Después de que su primera banda, Treebound Story (formada cuando todavía estaba en la escuela) se disolviera, Hawley encontró el éxito como miembro de la banda de britpop Longpigs en la década de 1990. Tras su disolución en 2000 se unió a la banda Pulp, dirigida por su amigo Jarvis Cocker, por un tiempo. Como músico solista, Hawley ha lanzado siete álbumes de estudio. Jarvis Cocker de Pulp y Steve Mackey (ex compañero de clase de la escuela secundaria Hucklow) instaron a Hawley a grabar su primer mini-álbum homónimo, lanzado en 2000. En 2001, Late Night Final, llamado así por el El grito de los vendedores que vendían el periódico vespertino Sheffield Star en las calles de la ciudad, recibió críticas positivas por parte de la prensa, aunque ventas nada espectaculares. Dos años después, Hawley lanzó Lowedges, que lleva el nombre de un suburbio de la ciudad que el joven Hawley había visto en el plano de un autobús. La NME llamó a Lowedges el \"primer gran álbum de 2003\" y encabezó una encuesta de fin de año realizada por Virgin Radio. El elogio de la crítica fue generalizado, lo que llevó a muchos grandes nombres como Coldplay, Radiohead y R.E.M. entusiasmarse con el trabajo de Hawley.\nDespués de la desaparición de Setanta Records en 2004, Hawley finalmente firmó con Mute Records, una división de EMI. Las disputas legales retrasaron Coles Corner, el cuarto lanzamiento de Hawley, hasta septiembre de 2005. Hasta el momento su album más relevante ha sido Hollow Meadows editado en 2015.",

      "bio_content": "Richard Hawley (born Richard Willis Hawley, 17 January 1967, Sheffield, United Kingdom) is a critically-acclaimed guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. Hawley initially found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990's, and formerly Treebound Story. When a drug-filled torpor after an extensive tour of America brought the band to the brink of extinction in 1997, Hawley was asked to play with Pulp by his close friend and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. \"They saved my life,\" Hawley later recalled, \"I was going mental with drink and drugs.\" The subsequent world tour in support of Pulp's album This Is Hardcore left Hawley emotionally and physically drained on his return to his home city. During this time, he even considered leaving the music industry altogether.\n\nIt was an encounter at Hawley's Sheffield home that led the longtime collaborator out of the shadows. Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey urged Hawley to head into the studio and begin work on his first solo release. 2000's eponymous mini album encouraged Hawley to return to the studio once more. In 2001 Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges, another Sheffield reference, this time to the curiously named suburb of the city that had so entranced the young Hawley when he had seen it on the destination board of a bus. NME called Lowedges the \"first great album of 2003\" and it topped an end of year poll held by Virgin Radio.\n\nIn 2004 Hawley signed to Mute Records, a division of the giant EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Cole's Corner, Hawley's fourth release, until September 2005. Again Hawley mines the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Cole's Corner eventually gained a nomination for the acclaimed Mercury Prize in 2006.\n\nHawley's work as a session musician and producer remains in high demand. After contributing towards her eponymous 2004 release, Hawley also supported Nancy Sinatra on her European tour in 2005. In the past, Hawley has also worked with artists as diverse as New York's A Girl Called Eddy, All Saints (he played the guitar solo on their cover of \"Under the Bridge\"), Nellee Hooper's soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet and with Jarvis Cocker's Relaxed Muscle project.\n\nAside from his solo and session work, Hawley occasionally tours with The Feral Cats, a side project that enables him to explore his interest in rockabilly music.\n\nPossibly due to his aforementioned rockabilly interest, Hawley once auditioned for the role as guitarist in the rockabilly-inclined Morrissey's band.\n\nFiercely proud of his working class upbringing, Hawley recently described himself as \"jurassic labour\" in response to a question about the New Labour project. He lives in Sheffield, with his wife and children and is an avid Sheffield Wednesday supporter.\n\nIn 2007 Hawley released a new studio album, Lady's Bridge (the title refers to a bridge Hawley regulary crosses in his native Sheffield) again to much critical acclaim.\n\nHawley's album Truelove's Gutter was released in September 2009 and followed that October by a UK nationwide tour. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.\n\nFollowing the success of his award-winning, hugely acclaimed 2009 album 'Truelove's Gutter', Richard Hawley will release his sixth studio album, 'Standing At The Sky's Edge' - his first for new label Parlophone - on 7th May.\n\nRecorded at Sheffield's Yellow Arch Studio in 2011, 'Standing At The Sky's Edge' marks a seismic shift in direction for Hawley. The album is a euphoric, sonic assault on the senses, channelling elements of psychedelia, space rock and ragas with heavy riffs and raw, visceral guitar solos - as well as more familiar, tender moments - which will surprise Hawley's fans and peers alike.\nwww.richardhawley.co.uk <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Richard+Hawley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "Richard Willis Hawley (born 17 January 1967, Sheffield, England) is an English guitarist, singer-songwriter and producer. After his first band Treebound Story (formed while he was still at school) broke up, Hawley found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990s. After that group broke up in 2000, he later joined the band Pulp, led by his friend Jarvis Cocker, for a short time. As a solo musician, Hawley has released seven studio albums.\nImpressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey (a former classmate from Hucklow Middle School) urged Hawley to record his first eponymous mini-album, released in 2000. In 2001, Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges, named after a suburb of the city that the young Hawley had seen on the destination board of a bus. The NME called Lowedges the \"first great album of 2003\" and it topped an end-of-the-year poll held by Virgin Radio. Critical praise was widespread, leading many big names such as Coldplay, Radiohead and R.E.M. to enthuse about Hawley's work.\nAfter the demise of Setanta Records in 2004, Hawley eventually signed to Mute Records, a division of EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Coles Corner, Hawley's fourth release, until September 2005. Again, Hawley mined the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Coles Corner eventually gained a nomination for the Mercury Prize in 2006. Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys, whose debut album won the prize, famously exclaimed \"Someone call 999, Richard Hawley's been robbed!\"\nHawley's 2007 album Lady's Bridge (again named with a Sheffield reference - Lady's Bridge is in the centre of Sheffield) was released in the United Kingdom on 20 August 2007. He performed a 16-date tour during September 2007 to promote the album. Merchandising on the tour included the usual t-shirts and posters, but also special edition bottles of Sheffield-made Henderson's Relish. The bottles featured the album's artwork, and a note that it gave extra flavour to meat, fish, soups, pies, casseroles and vegetables. Hawley previously used the relish to promote Coles Corner.\nOn 14 January 2008, Hawley was nominated for his first solo Brit Award for Best British Male Performer. Hawley was a headlining act at the 2008 Festival Internacional de BenicÃ ssim in Spain. Hawley claimed that it was the best festival audience he had ever played to. Hawley recently produced, with Colin Elliot, and contributed two songs to the album Made in Sheffield, a compilation of songs by Sheffield-based songwriters for Tony Christie.\nTruelove's Gutter, Richard's sixth studio album, was released on Mute Records on 21 September 2009. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.\nHis song \"Don't Get Hung Up In Your Soul\" was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week for 17 November 2009. and \"Open Up Your Door\" currently features as the soundtrack song to the Häagen-Dazs ice cream TV commercial in the UK.\nHawley's track \"Tonight The Streets Are Ours\" was chosen as the title track for the Oscar nominated 2010 Banksy film Exit Through the Gift Shop which premièred at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010.\n\"You And I\" by Richard Hawley and The Death Ramps (AKA The Arctic Monkeys), has been released as the B-Side of The Arctic Monkeys' single \"Black Treacle\" on 23 January 2012.\n\"Standing at the Sky's Edge\" the 7th Hawley album was released in the UK on 7 May 2012 on the Parlophone record label. The first single, \"Leave Your Body Behind You\" is also available for download and will form part of the Singles Club releases Hawley intends for the coming months.",
      "biography_es": "Richard Willis Hawley (17 de enero de 1967 en Sheffield, Inglaterra), es un guitarrista, cantautor y productor inglés. Después de que su primera banda, Treebound Story (formada cuando todavía estaba en la escuela) se disolviera, Hawley encontró el éxito como miembro de la banda de britpop Longpigs en la década de 1990. Tras su disolución en 2000 se unió a la banda Pulp, dirigida por su amigo Jarvis Cocker, por un tiempo. Como músico solista, Hawley ha lanzado siete álbumes de estudio. Jarvis Cocker de Pulp y Steve Mackey (ex compañero de clase de la escuela secundaria Hucklow) instaron a Hawley a grabar su primer mini-álbum homónimo, lanzado en 2000. En 2001, Late Night Final, llamado así por el El grito de los vendedores que vendían el periódico vespertino Sheffield Star en las calles de la ciudad, recibió críticas positivas por parte de la prensa, aunque ventas nada espectaculares. Dos años después, Hawley lanzó Lowedges, que lleva el nombre de un suburbio de la ciudad que el joven Hawley había visto en el plano de un autobús. La NME llamó a Lowedges el \"primer gran álbum de 2003\" y encabezó una encuesta de fin de año realizada por Virgin Radio. El elogio de la crítica fue generalizado, lo que llevó a muchos grandes nombres como Coldplay, Radiohead y R.E.M. entusiasmarse con el trabajo de Hawley.\nDespués de la desaparición de Setanta Records en 2004, Hawley finalmente firmó con Mute Records, una división de EMI. Las disputas legales retrasaron Coles Corner, el cuarto lanzamiento de Hawley, hasta septiembre de 2005. Hasta el momento su album más relevante ha sido Hollow Meadows editado en 2015.",
