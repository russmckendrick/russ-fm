  "biography": "Neil Finn is a singer and songwriter and one of Te Awamutu, New Zealand's foremost musicians. Along with his brother Tim Finn, he was the co-frontman for Split Enz and is now the frontman for Crowded House. He has also recorded several successful solo albums, recorded two albums with his brother as the Finn Brothers, and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide projects.\n\nFinn is said to have decided to become a musician at the age of 12 and throughout his school years performed in hospitals and prisons, as well as at home gatherings. In 1976 he formed a group known as After Hours with Mark Hough, Geoff Chunn and Alan Brown. The following year, in 1977, Finn was invited to London to join Split Enz, the band formed by his elder brother, Tim Finn. Split Enz broke up in 1984 and Neil Finn formed a new band, Crowded House, with several other Australian and New Zealand musicians.\n\nCrowded House had a string of hits over the next 10 years, releasing four albums and culminating in a concert in the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. Finn went solo after this, releasing several albums as well as two albums with his brother Tim (Finn Brothers).\n\nIn 2007, Finn re-united Crowded House and released a new album, Time on Earth, and the band began a world tour. In 2010, another new album, \"Intriguer\", was released and coincided with another world tour.\n\nIn 2012, Finn recorded the track \"Song of the Lonely Mountain\", which was featured in the end credits of the movie \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Finn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Along with his brother Tim Finn, he was the co-frontman for Split Enz and is now the frontman for Crowded House. He has also recorded several successful solo albums, recorded two albums with his brother as the Finn Brothers, and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide projects.\n\nFinn is said to have decided to become a musician at the age of 12 and throughout his school years performed in hospitals and prisons, as well as at home gatherings. In 1976 he formed a group known as After Hours with Mark Hough, Geoff Chunn and Alan Brown. The following year, in 1977, Finn was invited to London to join Split Enz, the band formed by his elder brother, Tim Finn. Split Enz broke up in 1984 and Neil Finn formed a new band, Crowded House, with several other Australian and New Zealand musicians.\n\nCrowded House had a string of hits over the next 10 years, releasing four albums and culminating in a concert in the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. Finn went solo after this, releasing several albums as well as two albums with his brother Tim (Finn Brothers).\n\nIn 2007, Finn re-united Crowded House and released a new album, Time on Earth, and the band began a world tour. In 2010, another new album, \"Intriguer\", was released and coincided with another world tour.\n\nIn 2012, Finn recorded the track \"Song of the Lonely Mountain\", which was featured in the end credits of the movie \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Finn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
