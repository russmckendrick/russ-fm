      "biography": "Soundgarden was an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and drummer Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil (both of whom are the only members to appear in every incarnation of the band), and bassist Hiro Yamamoto; Cornell switched to rhythm guitar in 1985, replaced on drums initially by Scott Sundquist, and later by Matt Cameron in 1986. Yamamoto left in 1990 and was replaced initially by Jason Everman and shortly thereafter by Ben Shepherd. The band dissolved in 1997 and re-formed in 2010. Following Cornell's death in 2017 and a year of uncertainty regarding the band's future, Thayil declared in October 2018 that Soundgarden had disbanded once again, though they did reunite in January 2019 for a one-off concert in tribute to Cornell.\n\nThe band helped to popularize grunge music, a style of alternative rock that developed in the American Pacific Northwest in the mid-1980s, alongside such Seattle contemporaries as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. They were the first of a number of grunge bands to sign to the Seattle-based record label Sub Pop, through which they released EPs in both 1987 and 1988. California-based independent label SST Records released Soundgarden's debut album, Ultramega OK, which, although it did not sell well nationally, garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy award in 1990. Their second album, Louder Than Love, was recorded independently, but, after they signed with A&M Records in 1989 (making them one of the first grunge bands to sign to a major label), the album became their major-label debut. While Ultramega OK had failed to chart and Louder Than Love peaked at number 108 on the Billboard 200 album chart, the band's third album, Badmotorfinger, buoyed by the success of the singles \"Jesus Christ Pose\", \"Outshined\", and \"Rusty Cage\", reached number 39 on the Billboard 200 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA.\n\nSoundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album Superunknown, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles \"Spoonman\" and \"Black Hole Sun\". The band experimented with new sonic textures on their follow-up album Down on the Upside, which debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 in 1996 and spawned several hit singles of its own, including \"Burden in My Hand\" and \"Blow Up the Outside World\". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction and exhaustion from touring. After more than a decade of working on projects and other bands, they reunited in 2010, and Republic Records released their sixth and final studio album, King Animal, two years later.\n\nAs of 2019, Soundgarden had sold more than 14 million records in the United States, and an estimated 30 million worldwide. VH1 ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.",

      "editorial_notes": "In <i>Badmotorfinger</i>, Soundgarden created their first classic album. While their 1988 debut, <i>Ultramega OK</i>, and 1989 follow-up <i>Louder Than Love</i> earmarked them as leaders in a new generation of artists emerging from the Pacific Northwest of the United States, their third LP saw them mine a creative seam that lay somewhere between metal, punk, hard rock and jazz, without belonging solely to any of those genres—a sound that was familiar yet at the same time uniquely their own.\n\nThere had been two major changes in the Soundgarden camp since the release of <i>Louder Than Love</i>–the first was the arrival of bassist Ben Shepherd, who replaced co-founder Hiro Yamamoto, bringing to the band an edgy punk-rock spirit, a fiery creative streak and, perhaps most importantly, a new songwriting voice. \n\nThe second major development was that for the first time in their career, the songs they were writing had not been tested and honed in front of crowds, but were instead crafted and recorded in the rehearsal room and studio. While vocalist/guitarist Chris Cornell was the primary songwriter, each member played a more pronounced creative role than before—drummer Matt Cameron penned “Drawing Flies” and “Room A Thousand Years Wide”, while guitarist Kim Thayil wrote the lyrics for the latter. The only song featuring a credit for all four members was the chaotic “Jesus Christ Pose”, a seething commentary on media and religion, its title inspired by a photo Cornell saw of Jane’s Addiction singer Perry Farrell lying on a bed with his arms outstretched.\n\nSongwriting inspiration came from myriad places. Cornell wrote “Mind Riot” after a conversation with Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament, who remarked that writing a song with every guitar string tuned to E would be a silly pursuit—a challenge Cornell gleefully accepted. For rumbling opener “Rusty Cage”, the singer/guitarist wanted to pen a hillbilly/Black Sabbath crossover. (Outlaw country legend Johnny Cash would later put his spin on the song for his 1996 album <i>Unchained</i>, his foreboding baritone somehow making it even heavier.) “Room A Thousand Years Wide” and “Drawing Flies”, meanwhile, featured the caterwauling saxophone of Scott Granlund, introducing a new, at-times abrasive, sonic element to Soundgarden’s arsenal.\n\nReuniting with <i>Louder Than Love</i> producer Terry Date and recording in Studio D in Sausalito, the album takes its name from a mash-up of the band Badfinger (one of Thayil’s favourites) and the Montrose song “Bad Motor Scooter”, which Thayil heard while jamming with a friend. Given that one potential album title was <i>I’m Okay – Urinal Cake?</i>, when Thayil suggested the new monicker it was instantly accepted. \n\nWhen <i>Badmotorfinger</i> was launched into the world it came on the cusp of a seismic change in music. Released within weeks of Nirvana’s <i>Nevermind</i> and Pearl Jam’s <i>Ten</i>, Soundgarden were a leading light in a scene that was set to banish the then-ubiquitous hair metal in favour of a more daring and artistic sound, one rooted in reality rather than the larger-than-life, party-every-day showmanship of Poison and Warrant. <i>Badmotorfinger</i> was the perfect album for the time.",
