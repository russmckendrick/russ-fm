  "biography": "Ben Folds Five is a trio formed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States in 1994, who until their breakup in 2000 were a mainstay of Piano rock. Much of their work was influenced by jazz, evident in frequent improv-styled passages through bridge and/or ending.\n\nThe members of the band are Ben Folds, the lead singer and pianist, who also wrote most of the songs; Robert Sledge on bass; and Darren Jessee on drums. The group enjoyed the success of the single Brick in 1997, a ballad written by Folds (with a chorus by Jessee) about his high school girlfriend getting an abortion. This song has, to a large degree, misrepresented the band to fans who aren't familiar with their other work; \"Brick\" is a serious ballad, whereas most of their music is characterised by jazz inflections and witty, humorous lyrics.\n\nAfter the band's not-so amicable breakup in October 2000 over Ben's over shadowing of Sledge and Jessee, Folds began a solo career. Robert Sledge's subsequent band International Orange has broken up, while Darren Jessee is the frontman for the band Hotel Lights.\n\nFolds once described their music as \"punk rock for pussies\" - a reaction to the angst prevalent in 90s rock. When asked about his band's name he jokingly responded \"you mean a trio isn't five?\". In other interviews the band said that the name was simply because Ben Folds Five sounded better than Ben Folds Three.\n\nBen Folds has continued with producing music on his own, striking a subtler tone than Ben Folds Five's earlier recordings.  His personal relationship with William Shatner has opened the doors for a great professional one.  Ben Folds produced William Shatner's album Has Been and they have since worked together on The 'Over The Hedge' soundtrack.\n\nOn  September 18, 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the band reunited for the first time in nearly 10 years for one special gig playing their critically acclaimed final album: The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner in its entirety.\n\nThe House Songfacts reports that the trio got together in 2011 to record three new Ben Folds Five songs for the compilation,The Best Imitation of Myself: A Retrospective.\n\nTheir 4th studio album \"The Sound Of The Life Of The Mind\" released September 18th, 2012. A live album titled \"Ben Folds Live\" released soon after on June 3rd, 2013. \n\nAnother live album \"The Complete Sessions at West 54th\" originally recorded in June of 1997, released on July 10, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds+Five\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "bio_content": "Ben Folds Five is a trio formed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States in 1994, who until their breakup in 2000 were a mainstay of Piano rock. Much of their work was influenced by jazz, evident in frequent improv-styled passages through bridge and/or ending.\n\nThe members of the band are Ben Folds, the lead singer and pianist, who also wrote most of the songs; Robert Sledge on bass; and Darren Jessee on drums. The group enjoyed the success of the single Brick in 1997, a ballad written by Folds (with a chorus by Jessee) about his high school girlfriend getting an abortion. This song has, to a large degree, misrepresented the band to fans who aren't familiar with their other work; \"Brick\" is a serious ballad, whereas most of their music is characterised by jazz inflections and witty, humorous lyrics.\n\nAfter the band's not-so amicable breakup in October 2000 over Ben's over shadowing of Sledge and Jessee, Folds began a solo career. Robert Sledge's subsequent band International Orange has broken up, while Darren Jessee is the frontman for the band Hotel Lights.\n\nFolds once described their music as \"punk rock for pussies\" - a reaction to the angst prevalent in 90s rock. When asked about his band's name he jokingly responded \"you mean a trio isn't five?\". In other interviews the band said that the name was simply because Ben Folds Five sounded better than Ben Folds Three.\n\nBen Folds has continued with producing music on his own, striking a subtler tone than Ben Folds Five's earlier recordings.  His personal relationship with William Shatner has opened the doors for a great professional one.  Ben Folds produced William Shatner's album Has Been and they have since worked together on The 'Over The Hedge' soundtrack.\n\nOn  September 18, 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the band reunited for the first time in nearly 10 years for one special gig playing their critically acclaimed final album: The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner in its entirety.\n\nThe House Songfacts reports that the trio got together in 2011 to record three new Ben Folds Five songs for the compilation,The Best Imitation of Myself: A Retrospective.\n\nTheir 4th studio album \"The Sound Of The Life Of The Mind\" released September 18th, 2012. A live album titled \"Ben Folds Live\" released soon after on June 3rd, 2013. \n\nAnother live album \"The Complete Sessions at West 54th\" originally recorded in June of 1997, released on July 10, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds+Five\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
