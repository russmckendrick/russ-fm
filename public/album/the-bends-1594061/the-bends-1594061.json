      "biography": "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

      "editorial_notes": "By the mid-1990s, the members of Radiohead were exhausted. “Creep”, the brooding anthem from the band’s 1993 debut <i>Pablo Honey</i>, had become a surprise mega-hit, thanks to its music-box chorus and tidal noise. Yet the song had also turned into an albatross for Thom Yorke and his bandmates. They were sick of playing it live, and worried it would be their legacy. Could they write something as good as “Creep”—or would they be forever consigned to the junk bin of one-hit wonders?\n\nThe only way to find out was to head back into the studio. The stop-and-start sessions for the group’s sophomore album stretched across much of 1994, as Radiohead searched for songs and sounds that didn’t forever put them in a pigeonhole—but that also didn’t immediately alienate every audience member they’d earned.\n\nThe resulting album, 1995’s <i>The Bends</i>, kicks off with “Planet Telex”—a song written late in the process, but one that would demonstrate that Radiohead wasn’t aiming for another “Creep”. With its delayed pianos and wafting guitar chords offering new textures, and Yorke’s vocals offering a sense of frustrated urgency, “Planet Telex” announces the beginning of Radiohead’s first masterpiece.\n\nThe rest of <i>The Bends</i> is just as invigorating. Though these are recognisable guitar-rock songs—ones that are not altogether removed from 1995’s lingering grunge haze—Radiohead introduces a half-dozen new musical elements: There’s Yorke’s yearning falsetto during the gorgeous and tragic “Fake Plastic Trees”, inspired by a Jeff Buckley gig. The warped drums and strums of “High and Dry”. The accretive repetition of “Street Spirit (Fade Out)”. Even on first listen, it was clear Radiohead’s ambition, palette and experience had moved far beyond that of <i>Pablo Honey</i>.\n\n<i>The Bends</i> also announced Radiohead as savvy critics of modernity, with Yorke’s lyrics analysing our increasing distrust of technology—and its impact on our relationships—way better than his peers. Where “Fake Plastic Trees” decries our everything-all-the-time approach to consumerism, “Black Star” mourns our collective struggles with mental illnesses—and the way society can easily brush them aside. And while <i>The Bends</i> failed to deliver a “Creep”-sized hit, the album did set up Radiohead as one of music’s great iconoclasts—and set the band members on the path to art-rock infamy.",

            "content": "The Bends, released on 13 March 1995 in the United Kingdom and on 4 April 1995 in the United States, is the second studio album released by the English rock band Radiohead. The album was dedicated to the late comedian Bill Hicks. The album contains singles \"High and Dry\", \"Fake Plastic Trees\", \"Just\", \"My Iron Lung\", and \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\".\n\nThe Bends was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number 2 on Q's 100 Greatest Albums Ever.\n\nThe album was subject to much greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), and it reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single \"Creep\" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88. Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the US and the EU.\n\nAccording to the band, The Bends marked the start of a gradual turn in Yorke's songwriting from personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global themes that would come to dominate the band's later work. Most of the album was seen to continue the lyrical concerns of Pablo Honey, although in more mature fashion. The songs \"Fake Plastic Trees\" and, in particular, \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" and its b-side \"Talk Show Host\", are often seen as a precursor to their next album OK Computer (1997). \"Fake Plastic Trees\" was partly inspired by the commercial development of Canary Wharf, while \"Sulk\" was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre. According to Yorke, \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" was inspired by the book The Famished Road by Ben Okri.\n\nThe lyrics to the songs on The Bends, particularly those of \"My Iron Lung\", were cited in the British music press as an example of Yorke's alleged depression. Melody Maker ran an article during The Bends period which suggested Yorke would be the next \"rock 'n roll martyr\" or suicide.\n\nThe Bends was the first of the band's full-length records with artwork by Stanley Donwood, in collaboration with Yorke, who went under the name \"The White Chocolate Farm\" (later shortened to Tchock). Originally Yorke had wanted to use an image of an iron lung as the cover, but he lost it. The eventual album cover was created at the last minute by morphing a photograph taken by Donwood of a medical dummy with Yorke's own face. It is also the last Radiohead album whose liner notes and artwork include pictures of the band members.\n\nThe Bends met with much greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey, appearing on many end-of-year lists in 1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead's role as a standard-bearer of \"indie\" Brit-rock bands. The album was released during the height of the '90s Britpop movement, benefiting from renewed press attention to British guitar music; however, in the band's home country, Radiohead's music was rarely grouped with Blur, Pulp and other so-called \"Britpop\" acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.\n\nIn the United States, the album eventually reached number 88 on the Billboard 200 in 1996, while the single \"High and Dry\" reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, The Bends reached number 4 and remains a bestseller. In mid-1995 Radiohead toured as an opening act for R.E.M., playing songs from The Bends and extending their popularity with a mass audience.\n\nThe Bends had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, The Observer listed it as one of \"the 50 albums that changed music\", saying, \"Radiohead's Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis's Liam Gallagher. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one that eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, Coldplay would not exist, nor Keane, nor James Blunt.\" Radiohead members said they later distanced themselves from their mid '90s sound partly because they felt little affinity for those that adopted the sound.\n\nThe Bends took second place behind Radiohead's OK Computer in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of Q magazine for the best album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone initially gave the album an average rating. In 2000, Virgin's Top 1000 Albums of All Time ranked The Bends at number two, second only to Revolver by The Beatles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "The Bends, released on 13 March 1995 in the United Kingdom and on 4 April 1995 in the United States, is the second studio album released by the English rock band Radiohead. The album was dedicated to the late comedian Bill Hicks. The album contains singles \"High and Dry\", \"Fake Plastic Trees\", \"Just\", \"My Iron Lung\", and \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\".\n\nThe Bends was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number 2 on Q's 100 Greatest Albums Ever.\n\nThe album was subject to much greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), and it reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single \"Creep\" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88. Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the US and the EU.\n\nAccording to the band, The Bends marked the start of a gradual turn in Yorke's songwriting from personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global themes that would come to dominate the band's later work. Most of the album was seen to continue the lyrical concerns of Pablo Honey, although in more mature fashion. The songs \"Fake Plastic Trees\" and, in particular, \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" and its b-side \"Talk Show Host\", are often seen as a precursor to their next album OK Computer (1997). \"Fake Plastic Trees\" was partly inspired by the commercial development of Canary Wharf, while \"Sulk\" was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre. According to Yorke, \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" was inspired by the book The Famished Road by Ben Okri.\n\nThe lyrics to the songs on The Bends, particularly those of \"My Iron Lung\", were cited in the British music press as an example of Yorke's alleged depression. Melody Maker ran an article during The Bends period which suggested Yorke would be the next \"rock 'n roll martyr\" or suicide.\n\nThe Bends was the first of the band's full-length records with artwork by Stanley Donwood, in collaboration with Yorke, who went under the name \"The White Chocolate Farm\" (later shortened to Tchock). Originally Yorke had wanted to use an image of an iron lung as the cover, but he lost it. The eventual album cover was created at the last minute by morphing a photograph taken by Donwood of a medical dummy with Yorke's own face. It is also the last Radiohead album whose liner notes and artwork include pictures of the band members.\n\nThe Bends met with much greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey, appearing on many end-of-year lists in 1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead's role as a standard-bearer of \"indie\" Brit-rock bands. The album was released during the height of the '90s Britpop movement, benefiting from renewed press attention to British guitar music; however, in the band's home country, Radiohead's music was rarely grouped with Blur, Pulp and other so-called \"Britpop\" acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.\n\nIn the United States, the album eventually reached number 88 on the Billboard 200 in 1996, while the single \"High and Dry\" reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, The Bends reached number 4 and remains a bestseller. In mid-1995 Radiohead toured as an opening act for R.E.M., playing songs from The Bends and extending their popularity with a mass audience.\n\nThe Bends had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, The Observer listed it as one of \"the 50 albums that changed music\", saying, \"Radiohead's Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis's Liam Gallagher. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one that eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, Coldplay would not exist, nor Keane, nor James Blunt.\" Radiohead members said they later distanced themselves from their mid '90s sound partly because they felt little affinity for those that adopted the sound.\n\nThe Bends took second place behind Radiohead's OK Computer in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of Q magazine for the best album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone initially gave the album an average rating. In 2000, Virgin's Top 1000 Albums of All Time ranked The Bends at number two, second only to Revolver by The Beatles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
