  "biography": "There are two artists that have recorded under the name Forenzics: a Sydney-based experimental improvisation group and a project based around former Split Enz members Tim Finn and Eddie Rayner.  \n\na) Sydney-based Forenzics formed in 2005, a collective centered around guitarists Matthew Syres and Dirk Kruithof. The group released three albums, 2009's H3O, 2010's  Static and Silence, and 2014's Malign. They continued to perform sporadically, at least through 2019.\n\nb) Forenzics is the name used by New Zealand-based Tim Finn and Eddie Rayner, former members of legendary Split Enz. The name was inspired by the spark that launched the collaboration, an effort to mine elements from their previous band's catalog and build completely new songs out of them. The band announced itself in 2020 with a video for Walking, reconstructed from the 1975 track Walking Down A Road. The Shades and Echoes album appeared in 2022. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/forenzics\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
