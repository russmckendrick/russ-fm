  "biography": "The band was formed in 1993 by former Happy Mondays members Shaun Ryder and Bez. It was Ryder's first musical project after the disintegration of Happy Mondays due both to his multiple drug addictions and to disagreements about revenues with other bandmembers. The formation of the new band was intended to draw a line between his past life and his new one. Ryder and Bez recruited rappers Paul \"Kermit\" Leveridge and Carl \"Psycho\" McCarthy, drummer Jed Lynch (like Leveridge, a former member of Ruthless Rap Assassins), and guitarist Wags (formerly of the Manchester-based group the Paris Angels). Recording of new material started that year, although the group was not under contract.\nIn 1995 Black Grape was signed by Radioactive Records (an imprint of major label BMG) and released its debut album It's Great When You're Straight... Yeah. It immediately charted at number one in the UK Albums Chart, and spawned three Top Twenty singles.\nThe first single \"Reverend Black Grape\" managed to outsell the Happy Mondays cover of John Kongos \"(He's Gonna) Step On (You Again)\".\nThe third single, \"Kelly's Heroes\" - a song lampooning society's obsession with celebrities and idols that had much to do with Ryder's own previous hero worship of people he now saw as wastrels - had its opening lyric changed before recording from \"Don't talk to me about heroes - Most of these guys snort cocaine,\" to \"Don't talk to me about heroes - most of these men sink like subs .\". Another song on the album, \"Temazi Party\", mocked the then-current craze for abusing Temazepam sleeping pills (a.k.a. 'jellies'), but was deliberately misspelt on the album sleeve as 'Tramazi' instead of 'Temazi' in order to forestall any legal injunction against the album's release.\nIt's Great When You're Straight... Yeah received critical acclaim in the UK, but the group made little impact in the US. However, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich listed it as his favourite album of 1996. The album cover featured a picture of then-recently-imprisoned terrorist Carlos The Jackal.\nThe subsequent album Stupid Stupid Stupid was less favoured. The group split in 1998 after Ryder fired the rest of the band while touring, starting with Kermit (who was suffering from septicemia) and ending with Bez (who was unsatisfied with his financial situation).\nLynch went on to play drums and percussion on many other musical works, becoming a noted session musician.\nOn 2 February 2010, NME reported that Ryder will be reforming Black Grape with Saber and Kermit for a concert as part of the 'Get Loaded In The Dark' gig series on 1 April at The Coronet in London.",

Shaun and Bez added [a=Kermit (2)] and [a=Ged Lynch], both of the hip hop group [a=Ruthless Rap Assassins] (who were associated with Hulme/Manchester's baggy movement), as second vocalist/rapper and drummer, respectively, and also guitarist [a=Paul Wagstaff] from the baggy/madchester/indie-dance group [a=Paris Angels]. Gluing the sound together was [a=Danny Saber], a talented and prolific producer/remixer/multi-instrumentalist from Los Angeles, California. The combination of this supergroup of musicians essentially assured that resultant sound would fuse together the drugged- and thugged-out baggy attitude of the Mondays with a denser, brighter electronic and hip hop production style, and very well-produced rhythm tracks. Sonically, Black Grape emerged fully formed: harder-edged and brasher altogether than the Happy Mondays; elements of funk, hip hop, electronic, and soul, all of which were present in the previous group's music (but to a lesser extent) became far more saturated and less understated in the new group's style. One British music journalist of the time rather enthusiastically described Black Grape's debut album as \"the party Prince was describing in the song '1999'.\"",

        "profile": "Black Grape was started by vocalist/bandleader [a=Shaun Ryder] and dancer [a=Bez] of [a=Happy Mondays] after the dissolution of that group in 1993. Shaun and Bez added [a=Kermit (2)] and [a=Ged Lynch], both of the hip hop group [a=Ruthless Rap Assassins] (who were associated with Hulme/Manchester's baggy movement), as second vocalist/rapper and drummer, respectively, and also guitarist [a=Paul Wagstaff] from the baggy/madchester/indie-dance group [a=Paris Angels]. Gluing the sound together was [a=Danny Saber], a talented and prolific producer/remixer/multi-instrumentalist from Los Angeles, California. The combination of this supergroup of musicians essentially assured that resultant sound would fuse together the drugged- and thugged-out baggy attitude of the Mondays with a denser, brighter electronic and hip hop production style, and very well-produced rhythm tracks. Sonically, Black Grape emerged fully formed: harder-edged and brasher altogether than the Happy Mondays; elements of funk, hip hop, electronic, and soul, all of which were present in the previous group's music (but to a lesser extent) became far more saturated and less understated in the new group's style. One British music journalist of the time rather enthusiastically described Black Grape's debut album as \"the party Prince was describing in the song '1999'.\"",

      "biography_en": "The band was formed in 1993 by former Happy Mondays members Shaun Ryder and Bez. It was Ryder's first musical project after the disintegration of Happy Mondays due both to his multiple drug addictions and to disagreements about revenues with other bandmembers. The formation of the new band was intended to draw a line between his past life and his new one. Ryder and Bez recruited rappers Paul \"Kermit\" Leveridge and Carl \"Psycho\" McCarthy, drummer Jed Lynch (like Leveridge, a former member of Ruthless Rap Assassins), and guitarist Wags (formerly of the Manchester-based group the Paris Angels). Recording of new material started that year, although the group was not under contract.\nIn 1995 Black Grape was signed by Radioactive Records (an imprint of major label BMG) and released its debut album It's Great When You're Straight... Yeah. It immediately charted at number one in the UK Albums Chart, and spawned three Top Twenty singles.\nThe first single \"Reverend Black Grape\" managed to outsell the Happy Mondays cover of John Kongos \"(He's Gonna) Step On (You Again)\".\nThe third single, \"Kelly's Heroes\" - a song lampooning society's obsession with celebrities and idols that had much to do with Ryder's own previous hero worship of people he now saw as wastrels - had its opening lyric changed before recording from \"Don't talk to me about heroes - Most of these guys snort cocaine,\" to \"Don't talk to me about heroes - most of these men sink like subs .\". Another song on the album, \"Temazi Party\", mocked the then-current craze for abusing Temazepam sleeping pills (a.k.a. 'jellies'), but was deliberately misspelt on the album sleeve as 'Tramazi' instead of 'Temazi' in order to forestall any legal injunction against the album's release.\nIt's Great When You're Straight... Yeah received critical acclaim in the UK, but the group made little impact in the US. However, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich listed it as his favourite album of 1996. The album cover featured a picture of then-recently-imprisoned terrorist Carlos The Jackal.\nThe subsequent album Stupid Stupid Stupid was less favoured. The group split in 1998 after Ryder fired the rest of the band while touring, starting with Kermit (who was suffering from septicemia) and ending with Bez (who was unsatisfied with his financial situation).\nLynch went on to play drums and percussion on many other musical works, becoming a noted session musician.\nOn 2 February 2010, NME reported that Ryder will be reforming Black Grape with Saber and Kermit for a concert as part of the 'Get Loaded In The Dark' gig series on 1 April at The Coronet in London.",

Shaun and Bez added [a=Kermit (2)] and [a=Ged Lynch], both of the hip hop group [a=Ruthless Rap Assassins] (who were associated with Hulme/Manchester's baggy movement), as second vocalist/rapper and drummer, respectively, and also guitarist [a=Paul Wagstaff] from the baggy/madchester/indie-dance group [a=Paris Angels]. Gluing the sound together was [a=Danny Saber], a talented and prolific producer/remixer/multi-instrumentalist from Los Angeles, California. The combination of this supergroup of musicians essentially assured that resultant sound would fuse together the drugged- and thugged-out baggy attitude of the Mondays with a denser, brighter electronic and hip hop production style, and very well-produced rhythm tracks. Sonically, Black Grape emerged fully formed: harder-edged and brasher altogether than the Happy Mondays; elements of funk, hip hop, electronic, and soul, all of which were present in the previous group's music (but to a lesser extent) became far more saturated and less understated in the new group's style. One British music journalist of the time rather enthusiastically described Black Grape's debut album as \"the party Prince was describing in the song '1999'.\"",

        "profile": "Black Grape was started by vocalist/bandleader [a=Shaun Ryder] and dancer [a=Bez] of [a=Happy Mondays] after the dissolution of that group in 1993. Shaun and Bez added [a=Kermit (2)] and [a=Ged Lynch], both of the hip hop group [a=Ruthless Rap Assassins] (who were associated with Hulme/Manchester's baggy movement), as second vocalist/rapper and drummer, respectively, and also guitarist [a=Paul Wagstaff] from the baggy/madchester/indie-dance group [a=Paris Angels]. Gluing the sound together was [a=Danny Saber], a talented and prolific producer/remixer/multi-instrumentalist from Los Angeles, California. The combination of this supergroup of musicians essentially assured that resultant sound would fuse together the drugged- and thugged-out baggy attitude of the Mondays with a denser, brighter electronic and hip hop production style, and very well-produced rhythm tracks. Sonically, Black Grape emerged fully formed: harder-edged and brasher altogether than the Happy Mondays; elements of funk, hip hop, electronic, and soul, all of which were present in the previous group's music (but to a lesser extent) became far more saturated and less understated in the new group's style. One British music journalist of the time rather enthusiastically described Black Grape's debut album as \"the party Prince was describing in the song '1999'.\"",

      "bio_content": "Black Grape were a rock and roll band from Manchester, England, formed in 1993 by Shaun Ryder and Bez, formerly of Happy Mondays.\n\nThey recruited rapper Kermit and drummer Ged Lynch of the Manchester-based group The Ruthless Rap Assassins, plus guitarist Wags from The Paris Angels. Recording of new material started that year, although the group were not under contract. The key addition to the band was bassist and guitarist Danny Saber, who became Ryder's key musical foil.\n\nIn 1995 they signed to Radioactive Records (an imprint of major label BMG) and released their debut album, produced by Saber and Stephen Lironi. It's Great When You're Straight...Yeah immediately charted at number 1 in the UK, and spawned three Top 20 singles. According to Songfacts,  Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich listed it as his favorite CD of 1996.\n\nBlack Grape's music was funky and eclectic, using varied instrumentation and samples. Ryder's lyrics seem to derive mainly from nonsense rhymes and humorous catch-phrases. The debut album received critical acclaim in Britain, riding high during the then fashionable Britpop wave but the group made little impact in the U.S..\n\nThe subsequent album, 1997's Stupid Stupid Stupid was less favoured and charted at number 11 in the UK. The group split in 1998 after Ryder fired the rest of band while touring.\n\nThe band reformed for a one-off live show, their first in over 10 years, for Get Loaded in the Dark at the Coronet, London, on April 1, 2010. Five years later, the band announced plans for a tour to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their debut album. A reunion album, Pop Voodoo, was released in August 2017, although only Ryder and Kermit remained from the original lineup, with Youth handling bass, songwriting, and production duties. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Grape\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "The band was formed in 1993 by former Happy Mondays members Shaun Ryder and Bez. It was Ryder's first musical project after the disintegration of Happy Mondays due both to his multiple drug addictions and to disagreements about revenues with other bandmembers. The formation of the new band was intended to draw a line between his past life and his new one. Ryder and Bez recruited rappers Paul \"Kermit\" Leveridge and Carl \"Psycho\" McCarthy, drummer Jed Lynch (like Leveridge, a former member of Ruthless Rap Assassins), and guitarist Wags (formerly of the Manchester-based group the Paris Angels). Recording of new material started that year, although the group was not under contract.\nIn 1995 Black Grape was signed by Radioactive Records (an imprint of major label BMG) and released its debut album It's Great When You're Straight... Yeah. It immediately charted at number one in the UK Albums Chart, and spawned three Top Twenty singles.\nThe first single \"Reverend Black Grape\" managed to outsell the Happy Mondays cover of John Kongos \"(He's Gonna) Step On (You Again)\".\nThe third single, \"Kelly's Heroes\" - a song lampooning society's obsession with celebrities and idols that had much to do with Ryder's own previous hero worship of people he now saw as wastrels - had its opening lyric changed before recording from \"Don't talk to me about heroes - Most of these guys snort cocaine,\" to \"Don't talk to me about heroes - most of these men sink like subs .\". Another song on the album, \"Temazi Party\", mocked the then-current craze for abusing Temazepam sleeping pills (a.k.a. 'jellies'), but was deliberately misspelt on the album sleeve as 'Tramazi' instead of 'Temazi' in order to forestall any legal injunction against the album's release.\nIt's Great When You're Straight... Yeah received critical acclaim in the UK, but the group made little impact in the US. However, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich listed it as his favourite album of 1996. The album cover featured a picture of then-recently-imprisoned terrorist Carlos The Jackal.\nThe subsequent album Stupid Stupid Stupid was less favoured. The group split in 1998 after Ryder fired the rest of the band while touring, starting with Kermit (who was suffering from septicemia) and ending with Bez (who was unsatisfied with his financial situation).\nLynch went on to play drums and percussion on many other musical works, becoming a noted session musician.\nOn 2 February 2010, NME reported that Ryder will be reforming Black Grape with Saber and Kermit for a concert as part of the 'Get Loaded In The Dark' gig series on 1 April at The Coronet in London.",
