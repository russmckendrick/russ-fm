      "biography": "The Stone Roses are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. They were one of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement that was active during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's most successful lineup consists of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani, and drummer Reni.\nThe band released their debut album, The Stone Roses, in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and garnered critical acclaim, with many critics regarding it as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label. Their current record label, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991. The Stone Roses then released their second album, Second Coming, which was met with lacklustre reviews in 1994. The group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni first departing in late 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at the Reading Festival.\nFollowing much intensified media speculation, The Stone Roses called a press conference on 18 October 2011 to announce that the band had reunited and would perform a reunion tour of the world in 2012, including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester. Plans to record a third album in the future were also floated. In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of the new film which is set during the Stone Roses 1990 Spike Island show, revealed that the band \"have at least three or four new tracks recorded\". In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation directed by Shane Meadows and titled The Stone Roses: Made of Stone was released.",

      "editorial_notes": "The Stone Roses’ debut album heralded a seismic change in British music, but its impact was far from immediate. The self-titled record was released in May 1989 and barely scraped the Top 20 in the UK albums chart. Beyond a small cache of diehard fans in the music press, it was met with the sort of lukewarm reviews that cause most bands to start considering alternative career options. Not The Stone Roses, however. From the moment recording sessions for their debut were complete, their belief was absolute. They were going to be massive.\n\nIt wasn’t always that way. The Manchester quartet had been in operation since 1983 and had wondered if their chance would ever come. It all changed with the addition of bassist Gary “Mani” Mounfield to the line-up in late 1987, his fleet-footed funk grooves adding a new dimension to the mix of indie and psychedelia honed by vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire and drummer Alan “Reni” Wren. But still, only in-the-know locals cottoned on to the fact something was stirring. Producer John Leckie was an early convert and coaxed the band into London’s Battery Studios to begin album sessions. Here, working through the night and never in the daytime, they nailed definitive versions of future classics such as “Made of Stone”, “She Bangs the Drums” and “I Wanna Be Adored”, with other sessions following at Rockfield Studios in Wales and Ray Davies’ Konk. Everything had been meticulously planned and rehearsed beforehand, from the incessant, rhythmic drive at the start of “She Bangs the Drums” to the frenetic wig-out that brings final track “I Am the Resurrection” to its conclusion.\n\nToday, it’s hard to fathom how <i>The Stone Roses</i> didn’t immediately stop everyone in their tracks upon release. One of the great debuts of all time, it captures the essence of late-’80s Britain as it morphed into the ’90s at the same time as still sounding entirely fresh. It is the sound of cultures converging, the chiming guitars of ’80s indie meeting melodic ’60s pop and the euphoria of the dance floor—a mixture that would come to be defined as the “Madchester” sound. It’s soulful too, a record where yearning coexists with bolshie antagonism.\n\nWith the record out in the wild, a bigger story began to emerge. The band’s era-defining gig at Blackpool’s Empress Ballroom signalled the arrival of a new youth movement via an army of fans in bucket hats and baggy jeans, and it became a full national phenomenon when the group appeared on (legendary UK music show) <i>Top of the Pops</i> a few months later alongside fellow Mancunians Happy Mondays. A sea-change was afoot. The song they were playing? “Fools Gold”, a one-off single that compressed everything that was great about The Stone Roses into four and a half glorious minutes (or nine and a half, if you got the 12-inch version): the cockiness, the pulsating sway of their rhythm section, the lithe riffs, the sheer charisma of a nonchalant vocal. The song was added to non-UK versions of the album. \n\nBy the time the Roses’ legendary Spike Island gig took place in May 1990—the band playing to a crowd of over 30,000 on a man-made island in Widnes—<i>The Stone Roses</i> had re-entered the charts five times. Its success goes way beyond chart placings, however—the further you get away from it, the more important it seems. It’s an album that planted the seed for Britpop, an album that gave Liam Gallagher the notion that he could be a singer in a band one day too, that inspired people to dream. The Stone Roses would never recapture its greatness again, and they wouldn’t need to. Here, they were caught in perfect alchemy.",

            "content": "The Stone Roses LP was recorded between June 1988 and Febuary 1989 by the Stone Roses with producer John Leckie. It was then released on the 13th of March 1989 on the Silvertone music label. The artwork for the album was inspired by American artist Jackson Pollock. The album was then released in the United States on the 2nd of May 1989, following a release in Australia in December that year. The album has since seen various re-releases, in September 1991, then in 1999 for the 10 year anniversary edition and just recently it was announced their would be a 20th anniversary edition also. It cemented the band's reputation among critics, even today, as one of the most important albums ever. In 2006, the writers of NME declared the album the greatest British album of all time.\n\nAs with most Stone Roses releases, the cover displays a work by John Squire. It is a Jackson Pollock-influenced piece titled \"Bye Bye Badman,\" which makes reference to the May 1968 riots in Paris.\n\nThe cover was named by Q magazine as one of \"The 100 Best Covers of All Time.\" In the accompanying article, Squire said: \"Ian  had met this French man when he was hitching around Europe, this bloke had been in the riots, and he told Ian how lemons had been used as an antidote to tear gas. Then there was the documentary—-a great shot at the start of a guy throwing stones at the police. I really liked his attitude.\" This story was also the inspiration for the lyrics to the song of the same name. The background of the piece is based on the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. The band visited the causeway while playing a gig at the University of Ulster in Coleraine.\n\nIn 1989, the critical response was generally positive, and today the album is widely considered to be one of the very best British albums ever released. In 1997, it was named the 2nd greatest album of all time in a \"Music of the Millennium\" poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 4, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 29 in its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\" In 2008, it was named the 5th \"greatest British album ever\" by a Q magazine/HMV poll.\n\nThe music weekly NME initially gave the album 7 out of 10, but lavished praise on it in later years. In 2000, it received the \"greatest album ever\" award at the NME Premier Awards show, and in 2006, the album topped the magazine's \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\" list. In summer 2009, NME released a special issue about the album's 20th anniversary, labelling it as \"the greatest debut album ever.\"\n\nIn 2005, Spin magazine ranked it 78 on its list of the \"100 greatest albums of the past twenty years.\" In the same year, when revising the \"500 Greatest Albums\" for book format, Rolling Stone included it as one of the eight new entries placing it at #497. In 2006, Time named it one of \"The All-TIME 100 Albums.\" In 2003, Pitchfork Media named it the 39th best album of the 1980s.\n\nLast.fm's tracklist is almost entirely wrong. The original UK release of the album is as follows:\n\n1. I Wanna Be Adored - 4:52\n2. She Bangs the Drums - 3:47\n3. Waterfall - 4:41\n4. Don't Stop - 5:21\n5. Bye Bye Badman - 4:07\n6. Elizabeth My Dear - 0:56\n7. (Song for My) Sugar Spun Sister - 3:27\n8. Made of Stone - 4:15\n9. Shoot You Down - 4:14\n10. This Is the One - 4:59\n11. I Am the Resurrection - 8:14\n\nThe original US release of the album adds \"Elephant Stone\" (3:04) in between tracks 2 & 3 and \"Fools Gold\" (9:53) at the end of the album. A different 1991 UK release includes the same mix of \"Elephant Stone\" in between tracks 5 and 6, and a shortened single mix of \"Fools Gold\" (4:15) at the end of the album. A 10th anniversary releases uses the original UK track listing and features a bonus disc with the following four songs, plus an enhanced portion with bonus video content, a discography, lyrics, and a photo gallery:\n\n1. Fools Gold - 9:53\n2. What the World Is Waiting For - 3:55\n3. Elephant Stone - 4:48\n4. Where Angels Play - 4:15\n\nA 20th anniversary reissue includes a disc containing early demos for the album, including the following tracks:\n\n1. I Wanna Be Adored - 3:45\n2. She Bangs the Drums - 3:49\n3. Waterfall - 4:47\n4. Bye Bye Badman - 4:08\n5. Sugar Spun Sister - 3:32\n6. Shoot You Down - 4:28\n7. This Is the One - 4:03\n8. I Am the Resurrection - 6:41\n9. Elephant Stone - 3:16\n10. Going Down - 2:42\n11. Mersey Paradise - 2:50\n12. Where Angels Play - 3:19\n13. Something's Burning - 3:05\n14. One Love - 6:23\n15. Pearl Bastard - 3:43\n20. Something's Burning (hidden track) - 3:39\n\nSeveral editions have an additional bonus disc containing singles, B-sides, and various other outtakes from the era of the album (in particular, including the entirety of the band's rarities collection Turns into Stone, though in a different order):\n\n1. Elephant Stone - 4:53\n2. Full Fathom Five - 3:05\n3. The Hardest Thing in the World - 2:44\n4. Going Down - 2:48\n5. Guernica - 4:23\n6. Mersey Paradise - 2:46\n7. Standing Here - 5:09\n8. Simone - 4:25\n9. Fools Gold - 9:55\n10. What the World Is Waiting For - 3:51\n11. One Love - 7:46\n12. Something's Burning - 7:45\n13. Where Angels Play - 4:14\n\nAdditional releases contain LPs of the album and bonus material, a USB flash drive, and various other items. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/The+Stone+Roses\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I really liked his attitude.\" This story was also the inspiration for the lyrics to the song of the same name. The background of the piece is based on the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. The band visited the causeway while playing a gig at the University of Ulster in Coleraine.\n\nIn 1989, the critical response was generally positive, and today the album is widely considered to be one of the very best British albums ever released. In 1997, it was named the 2nd greatest album of all time in a \"Music of the Millennium\" poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 4, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 29 in its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\" In 2008, it was named the 5th \"greatest British album ever\" by a Q magazine/HMV poll.\n\nThe music weekly NME initially gave the album 7 out of 10, but lavished praise on it in later years. In 2000, it received the \"greatest album ever\" award at the NME Premier Awards show, and in 2006, the album topped the magazine's \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\" list. In summer 2009, NME released a special issue about the album's 20th anniversary, labelling it as \"the greatest debut album ever.\"\n\nIn 2005, Spin magazine ranked it 78 on its list of the \"100 greatest albums of the past twenty years.\" In the same year, when revising the \"500 Greatest Albums\" for book format, Rolling Stone included it as one of the eight new entries placing it at #497. In 2006, Time named it one of \"The All-TIME 100 Albums.\" In 2003, Pitchfork Media named it the 39th best album of the 1980s.\n\nLast.fm's tracklist is almost entirely wrong. The original UK release of the album is as follows:\n\n1. I Wanna Be Adored - 4:52\n2. She Bangs the Drums - 3:47\n3. Waterfall - 4:41\n4. Don't Stop - 5:21\n5. Bye Bye Badman - 4:07\n6. Elizabeth My Dear - 0:56\n7. (Song for My) Sugar Spun Sister - 3:27\n8. Made of Stone - 4:15\n9. Shoot You Down - 4:14\n10. This Is the One - 4:59\n11. I Am the Resurrection - 8:14\n\nThe original US release of the album adds \"Elephant Stone\" (3:04) in between tracks 2 & 3 and \"Fools Gold\" (9:53) at the end of the album. A different 1991 UK release includes the same mix of \"Elephant Stone\" in between tracks 5 and 6, and a shortened single mix of \"Fools Gold\" (4:15) at the end of the album. A 10th anniversary releases uses the original UK track listing and features a bonus disc with the following four songs, plus an enhanced portion with bonus video content, a discography, lyrics, and a photo gallery:\n\n1. Fools Gold - 9:53\n2. What the World Is Waiting For - 3:55\n3. Elephant Stone - 4:48\n4. Where Angels Play - 4:15\n\nA 20th anniversary reissue includes a disc containing early demos for the album, including the following tracks:\n\n1. I Wanna Be Adored - 3:45\n2. She Bangs the Drums - 3:49\n3. Waterfall - 4:47\n4. Bye Bye Badman - 4:08\n5. Sugar Spun Sister - 3:32\n6. Shoot You Down - 4:28\n7. This Is the One - 4:03\n8. I Am the Resurrection - 6:41\n9. Elephant Stone - 3:16\n10. Going Down - 2:42\n11. Mersey Paradise - 2:50\n12. Where Angels Play - 3:19\n13. Something's Burning - 3:05\n14. One Love - 6:23\n15. Pearl Bastard - 3:43\n20. Something's Burning (hidden track) - 3:39\n\nSeveral editions have an additional bonus disc containing singles, B-sides, and various other outtakes from the era of the album (in particular, including the entirety of the band's rarities collection Turns into Stone, though in a different order):\n\n1. Elephant Stone - 4:53\n2. Full Fathom Five - 3:05\n3. The Hardest Thing in the World - 2:44\n4. Going Down - 2:48\n5. Guernica - 4:23\n6. Mersey Paradise - 2:46\n7. Standing Here - 5:09\n8. Simone - 4:25\n9. Fools Gold - 9:55\n10. What the World Is Waiting For - 3:51\n11. One Love - 7:46\n12. Something's Burning - 7:45\n13. Where Angels Play - 4:14\n\nAdditional releases contain LPs of the album and bonus material, a USB flash drive, and various other items. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses/The+Stone+Roses\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
