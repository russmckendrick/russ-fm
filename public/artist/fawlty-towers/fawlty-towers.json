  "biography": "Fawlty Towers is a BBC television sitcom that was first broadcast on BBC2 in 1975 and 1979. Twelve episodes were made (two series, each of six episodes). The show was written by John Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth, both of whom also starred in the show.\n\nThe series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the \"English Riviera\". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.\n\nIn a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.\n\n\n\nThis is not an artist, but appears here due to incorrectly tagged soundtracks. If this non-artist appears in your charts, do Last.fm and yourself a favour. Fix your tags by putting the actual artist name in the artist field. The easiest way is to use Picard. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fawlty+Towers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
