  "biography": "The Delgados were a Scottish indie rock band from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. The band was composed of Alun Woodward, Stewart Henderson, Paul Savage and Emma Pollock.\n\nThe band was formed after friends Woodward, Henderson and Savage were ejected from the band Bubblegum. Joined by Savage's then-girlfriend Pollock, the band named themselves after Tour de France winning cyclist, Pedro Delgado.\nTheir first commercial release came with the inclusion of their track \"Liquidation Girl\" on the compilation album Skookum Chief Powered Teenage Zit Rock Angst from Nardwuar the Human Serviette. Instead of signing to a record label, the band started their own, Chemikal Underground, on which they released their own records and also some from other local bands, among them Mogwai and Arab Strap. Chemikal Underground's first release was the Delgados first single \"Monica Webster / Brand New Car\". The single caught the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, and the band quickly became one of his favourites, going on to record fifteen sessions for his show.\n\nThe cost of Chemikal Underground's second release, the single \"Disco Nation 45\" by Bis, left the cash-strapped label unable to afford another release by the Delgados, so their next release \"Lazarwalker\" came from the London-based Radar Records. Tempted by Radar to a five album deal, the band declined, instead poaching their A&R contact, Graeme Beattie, for work at Chemikal Underground.\nAnother single, \"Cinecentre\" followed in early 1996 as the band juggled work at the label with several tours, and recorded their debut album. The band released two more singles, this time taken from their album Domestiques released in November 1996. The song \"Under Canvas, Under Wraps\" being voted number three in John Peel's Festive Fifty.\n\nThe band released their second album in 1998. Peloton - also a cycling reference. The single \"Pull the Wires From the Wall\" gave the Delgados their first hit single in the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 69. The band's close relationship with Peel continued, with \"Pull the Wires From the Wall\" voted to number one in the Festive Fifty (it would also make the all time chart made in 2000).\nThe Delgados' evolution continued with The Great Eastern in 2000. The record was produced by Dave Fridmann. Their next single, \"American Trilogy\", reached number 61 in the UK chart. The record was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.\nTheir fourth album, Hate, was released on Mantra rather than the band's own label. The song \"The Light Before We Land\" was used as the opening theme for the anime Gunslinger Girl, while the song \"Woke From Dreaming\" is played at the beginning of episode 7.\nThe band returned to their own label for 2004's Universal Audio.\nThe band announced they were splitting up in April 2005 due to the departure of Henderson who found it difficult \"to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect  felt it deserved.\" The four will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Pollock and Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while Savage will continue production duties at the band's Chem19 Studios in Hamilton and in a new studio.\nSince the band's separation, the track \"I Fought the Angels\" from Universal Audio has been used in the fourth episode in the second season of the Golden Globe-winning medical drama Grey's Anatomy in 2006, and in the opening scene in the series premiere of BBC Three's Lip Service in 2010.\nA double disc containing 29 tracks, The Complete BBC Peel Sessions, was released on 12 June 2006 in Europe, and later in the year in the United States. Woodward released his debut solo album in June 2009 under the name Lord Cut-Glass. Savage also played on the album.",

Joined by Paul\\'s then-girlfriend Emma Pollock (vocals/guitar), the band chose to name themselves after Tour de France winning cyclist Pedro Delgado. They split in April 2005, with Emma signing a solo deal with 4AD shortly afterwards. June 2006 saw the release of a mammoth 29 track album of all the band\\'s Peel sessions.\\n\\nThe band continue to turn out promising independent artists under their cult record label Chemikal Underground.\\n\\nTheir first commercial release came with the inclusion of their track \"Liquidation Girl\" on the compilation album Skookum Chief Powered Teenage Zit Rock Angst from Nardwuar the Human Serviette. Neglecting to go the traditional route of signing to a record label, the band instead started their own, Chemikal Underground, with which to release not only their records but also those of other local bands. Chemikal Underground\\'s first release was naturally The Delgados first single Monica Webster / Brand New Car. Despite being greatly overshadowed by the Blur/Oasis race, the single caught the attention of veteran BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel and the band quickly became one of his favourites, going on to play more than ten sessions for his show.\\n\\nThe cost of Chemikal Underground\\'s second release, the single Disco Nation 45 by Bis, left the cash-strapped label unable to afford another release by The Delgados, so their next release Lazarwalker came from the London based Radar Records. Tempted by Radar to a five album deal, the band declined, instead poaching their A&R contact, Graeme Beattie, for work at Chemikal Underground.\\n\\nAnother single, Cinecentre followed in early 1996 as the band juggled work at the label (made all the more hectic with Bis\\' appearance on Top of the Pops) with several tours, and recording their debut album. The band released two more singles, this time taken from their album Domestiques released on October 28, 1996. Both singles and the album were critically lauded, with the song \"Under Canvas, Under Wraps\" being voted number three in John Peel\\'s Festive Fifty.\\n\\nThe band released their second album in 1998. Peloton - also a cycling reference - which saw the band begin to broaden their musical palette. Including a wider range of styles and more complex arrangements the record proved a critical success. It did not sell in huge numbers, however, though the single Pull the Wires From the Wall gave the Delgados their first UK chart hit, reaching number 69. The band\\'s close relationship with John Peel continued, with Pull the Wires From the Wall voted to number one in the Festive Fifty (it would also make the all time chart made in 2000) and other entries at 9 and 38.\\n\\nThe Delgados\\' evolution continued with The Great Eastern in 2000. The record, produced by Dave Fridmann, was heavily orchestrated and contained shifting time signatures. Again, the record was lauded by the critics but failed to significantly expand the band\\'s following. The first single, American Trilogy, reached number 61 in the UK charts. The record was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and four of its songs reached the Festive Fifty, two in the top ten.\\n\\nThis pattern was extended for their fourth album, Hate, which was released on Mantra rather than the band\\'s own Chemikal Underground label. The album\\'s epic songs were popular among critics and festive fifty voters but a wider public still proved elusive. The song The Light Before We Land was used as the opening music for the anime Gunslinger Girl, bringing the band to a new audience.\\n\\nThe band returned to their own label for 2004\\'s \\'Universal Audio\\' - which marked something of a move away from the orchestrated sounds of its two predecessors, towards a simpler, poppier approach.\\n\\nThe band announced they were disbanding in April 2005 due to the departure of bass player Stewart Henderson who found it difficult \"to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect I felt it deserved\". The four friends will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Emma Pollock and Alun Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while drummer Paul Savage will continue production duties at the band\\'s Chem19 Studios in Hamilton and in a new studio.\\n\\nThe members recently announced that they\\'ve secured the rights for their BBC session performances. A double-disc containing 29 tracks was released on June 12th 2006 in Europe. A release in the USA is expected before the end of 2006.\\n\\nIn June 2022, the band announced that they were reforming. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Delgados\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song The Light Before We Land was used as the opening music for the anime Gunslinger Girl, bringing the band to a new audience.\\n\\nThe band returned to their own label for 2004\\'s \\'Universal Audio\\' - which marked something of a move away from the orchestrated sounds of its two predecessors, towards a simpler, poppier approach.\\n\\nThe band announced they were disbanding in April 2005 due to the departure of bass player Stewart Henderson who found it difficult \"to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect I felt it deserved\". The four friends will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Emma Pollock and Alun Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while drummer Paul Savage will continue production duties at the band\\'s Chem19 Studios in Hamilton and in a new studio.\\n\\nThe members recently announced that they\\'ve secured the rights for their BBC session performances. A double-disc containing 29 tracks was released on June 12th 2006 in Europe. A release in the USA is expected before the end of 2006.\\n\\nIn June 2022, the band announced that they were reforming. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Delgados\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "The Delgados were a Scottish indie rock band from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. The band was composed of Alun Woodward, Stewart Henderson, Paul Savage and Emma Pollock.\n\nThe band was formed after friends Woodward, Henderson and Savage were ejected from the band Bubblegum. Joined by Savage's then-girlfriend Pollock, the band named themselves after Tour de France winning cyclist, Pedro Delgado.\nTheir first commercial release came with the inclusion of their track \"Liquidation Girl\" on the compilation album Skookum Chief Powered Teenage Zit Rock Angst from Nardwuar the Human Serviette. Instead of signing to a record label, the band started their own, Chemikal Underground, on which they released their own records and also some from other local bands, among them Mogwai and Arab Strap. Chemikal Underground's first release was the Delgados first single \"Monica Webster / Brand New Car\". The single caught the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, and the band quickly became one of his favourites, going on to record fifteen sessions for his show.\n\nThe cost of Chemikal Underground's second release, the single \"Disco Nation 45\" by Bis, left the cash-strapped label unable to afford another release by the Delgados, so their next release \"Lazarwalker\" came from the London-based Radar Records. Tempted by Radar to a five album deal, the band declined, instead poaching their A&R contact, Graeme Beattie, for work at Chemikal Underground.\nAnother single, \"Cinecentre\" followed in early 1996 as the band juggled work at the label with several tours, and recorded their debut album. The band released two more singles, this time taken from their album Domestiques released in November 1996. The song \"Under Canvas, Under Wraps\" being voted number three in John Peel's Festive Fifty.\n\nThe band released their second album in 1998. Peloton - also a cycling reference. The single \"Pull the Wires From the Wall\" gave the Delgados their first hit single in the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 69. The band's close relationship with Peel continued, with \"Pull the Wires From the Wall\" voted to number one in the Festive Fifty (it would also make the all time chart made in 2000).\nThe Delgados' evolution continued with The Great Eastern in 2000. The record was produced by Dave Fridmann. Their next single, \"American Trilogy\", reached number 61 in the UK chart. The record was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.\nTheir fourth album, Hate, was released on Mantra rather than the band's own label. The song \"The Light Before We Land\" was used as the opening theme for the anime Gunslinger Girl, while the song \"Woke From Dreaming\" is played at the beginning of episode 7.\nThe band returned to their own label for 2004's Universal Audio.\nThe band announced they were splitting up in April 2005 due to the departure of Henderson who found it difficult \"to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect  felt it deserved.\" The four will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Pollock and Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while Savage will continue production duties at the band's Chem19 Studios in Hamilton and in a new studio.\nSince the band's separation, the track \"I Fought the Angels\" from Universal Audio has been used in the fourth episode in the second season of the Golden Globe-winning medical drama Grey's Anatomy in 2006, and in the opening scene in the series premiere of BBC Three's Lip Service in 2010.\nA double disc containing 29 tracks, The Complete BBC Peel Sessions, was released on 12 June 2006 in Europe, and later in the year in the United States. Woodward released his debut solo album in June 2009 under the name Lord Cut-Glass. Savage also played on the album.",

      "bio_content": "The Delgados are a Scottish indie rock band who formed in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire in 1994 after friends Alun Woodward (vocals/guitar), Stewart Henderson (bass) and Paul Savage (drums) were forcibly ejected from the band Bubblegum. Joined by Paul's then-girlfriend Emma Pollock (vocals/guitar), the band chose to name themselves after Tour de France winning cyclist Pedro Delgado. They split in April 2005, with Emma signing a solo deal with 4AD shortly afterwards. June 2006 saw the release of a mammoth 29 track album of all the band's Peel sessions.\n\nThe band continue to turn out promising independent artists under their cult record label Chemikal Underground.\n\nTheir first commercial release came with the inclusion of their track \"Liquidation Girl\" on the compilation album Skookum Chief Powered Teenage Zit Rock Angst from Nardwuar the Human Serviette. Neglecting to go the traditional route of signing to a record label, the band instead started their own, Chemikal Underground, with which to release not only their records but also those of other local bands. Chemikal Underground's first release was naturally The Delgados first single Monica Webster / Brand New Car. Despite being greatly overshadowed by the Blur/Oasis race, the single caught the attention of veteran BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel and the band quickly became one of his favourites, going on to play more than ten sessions for his show.\n\nThe cost of Chemikal Underground's second release, the single Disco Nation 45 by Bis, left the cash-strapped label unable to afford another release by The Delgados, so their next release Lazarwalker came from the London based Radar Records. Tempted by Radar to a five album deal, the band declined, instead poaching their A&R contact, Graeme Beattie, for work at Chemikal Underground.\n\nAnother single, Cinecentre followed in early 1996 as the band juggled work at the label (made all the more hectic with Bis' appearance on Top of the Pops) with several tours, and recording their debut album. The band released two more singles, this time taken from their album Domestiques released on October 28, 1996. Both singles and the album were critically lauded, with the song \"Under Canvas, Under Wraps\" being voted number three in John Peel's Festive Fifty.\n\nThe band released their second album in 1998. Peloton - also a cycling reference - which saw the band begin to broaden their musical palette. Including a wider range of styles and more complex arrangements the record proved a critical success. It did not sell in huge numbers, however, though the single Pull the Wires From the Wall gave the Delgados their first UK chart hit, reaching number 69. The band's close relationship with John Peel continued, with Pull the Wires From the Wall voted to number one in the Festive Fifty (it would also make the all time chart made in 2000) and other entries at 9 and 38.\n\nThe Delgados' evolution continued with The Great Eastern in 2000. The record, produced by Dave Fridmann, was heavily orchestrated and contained shifting time signatures. Again, the record was lauded by the critics but failed to significantly expand the band's following. The first single, American Trilogy, reached number 61 in the UK charts. The record was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and four of its songs reached the Festive Fifty, two in the top ten.\n\nThis pattern was extended for their fourth album, Hate, which was released on Mantra rather than the band's own Chemikal Underground label. The album's epic songs were popular among critics and festive fifty voters but a wider public still proved elusive. The song The Light Before We Land was used as the opening music for the anime Gunslinger Girl, bringing the band to a new audience.\n\nThe band returned to their own label for 2004's 'Universal Audio' - which marked something of a move away from the orchestrated sounds of its two predecessors, towards a simpler, poppier approach.\n\nThe band announced they were disbanding in April 2005 due to the departure of bass player Stewart Henderson who found it difficult \"to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect I felt it deserved\". The four friends will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Emma Pollock and Alun Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while drummer Paul Savage will continue production duties at the band's Chem19 Studios in Hamilton and in a new studio.\n\nThe members recently announced that they've secured the rights for their BBC session performances. A double-disc containing 29 tracks was released on June 12th 2006 in Europe. A release in the USA is expected before the end of 2006.\n\nIn June 2022, the band announced that they were reforming. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Delgados\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
