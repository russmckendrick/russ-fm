      "biography": "Mötley Crüe is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1981. The group was founded by bass guitarist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee, who were later joined by lead guitarist Mick Mars and lead singer Vince Neil. Mötley Crüe has been described through the years as the World's Most Notorious Rock Band and has sold more than 80 million album copies worldwide, including 25 million in the U.S.\n\nThe band members have often been noted for their hedonistic lifestyles, and the persona they maintained. All the members have had numerous brushes with the law, spent time in prison, suffered from alcoholism, long addictions to drugs such as cocaine and heroin, had countless escapades with women and are heavily tattooed. Their ninth studio album, Saints of Los Angeles, was released on June 24, 2008, certified Gold album in January 2012. They are currently writing new material for a tenth studio album.\n\nMötley Crüe was formed on January 17, 1981 when bass guitarist Nikki Sixx left the band London and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and vocalist/guitarist Greg Leon. Lee had worked previously with Leon in a band called Suite 19 and the trio practiced together for some time with Leon eventually deciding not to continue. Tommy took over from previous drummer Butch Brusco. Nikki and Tommy then began a search for new members. Sixx and Lee soon met guitarist Bob \"Mick Mars\" Deal. Mars was quickly auditioned and subsequently hired by Sixx and Lee. Although a lead vocalist named O'Dean was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. On seeing him perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, Mars suggested they have Neil join the band. At first Neil refused the offer, but as the other members of Rock Candy became involved in outside projects, Neil grew anxious to try something else. When Lee made one final appeal to audition, Neil accepted and was hired April 1, 1981. The newly formed band did not yet have a name. While trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident which occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group \"a motley looking crew.\" He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as Mottley Cru-. After modifying the spelling slightly, \"Mötley Crüe\" was eventually selected as the band's name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of metal umlauts supposedly inspired by the German beer Löwenbräu, which the members were drinking at the time.",

            "content": "Dr. Feelgood is the fifth album by  American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, released on September 1, 1989.\n\nDr. Feelgood topped the Billboard 200 (North America) chart. It is widely regarded by music critics and fans as being Mötley Crüe's strongest album, being the first album the band has recorded after their quest for sobriety and rehabilitation in 1989. Today Dr. Feelgood has sold more than 6 million copies in the U.S. alone. In various interviews, members of Mötley Crüe stated that it was their most solid album from a musical standpoint, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety.\n\nThe song \"Dr. Feelgood\" was ranked #41 on VH1's 100 Greatest '80s Songs.\n\n\n \n\n\n Musical style\nThe record represents a style of heavy rock commonly referred to as glam metal. It is characterized by heavy, distorted guitar riffs and catchy, melodic choruses.\n\n\n Production and marketing\nCanadian producer Bob Rock provided the record with a lush, vibrant sound, applying production values which had been lacking from the band's previous releases.\n\nRock found the process of working with Mötley Crüe difficult, describing the band as \"four L.A. bad asses who used to drink a bottle of wine and want to kill each other.\" In order to minimize conflict and allow production of the record to proceed smoothly, Rock had each member play their parts separately.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll lyrics by Nikki Sixx\n\n\"T.N.T.
