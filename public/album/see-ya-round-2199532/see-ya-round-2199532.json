      "biography": "Split Enz were one of the most successful and longest running bands ever to emerge from New Zealand. Founded in 1972 by Tim Finn and Phil Judd, and with a variety of other members during its existence, eight songs Split Enz were listed in the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time, more than any other band. The band played its final show on 4 December 1984 in Auckland. One-off reunions took place subsequently, with the band reuniting in 1993 for its twentieth anniversary tour and once more for a tour in 2006.\n\nThe band was formed in Auckland, New Zealand in 1972 by Tim Finn, Phil Judd, Mike Chunn, Miles Golding, and Mike Howard, who originally called themselves \"Split Ends.\" They soon changed the spelling to honor their NZ homeland. For much of their career, the band was known for wild costumes and make-up designed by Crombie. For the first phase of their existence, the band played a kind of progressive rock infused with music-hall humor; later they slipped into a quirky new wave style that generated hits worldwide.\n\nNumerous personnel changes have been a defining factor for the Enz. Notable additions include keyboardist Eddie Rayner and percussionist Noel Crombie in 1974, and in 1977 Tim's brother Neil Finn (who would later form Crowded House). The group effectively disbanded in 1984, but in subsequent years have reunited several times for well-received tours including in 1993 for its twentieth anniversary tour and once more for a tour in 2006.\n\nLast.FM occasionally lists scrobbles belonging to a 60s garage band called The Split Ends (from Tampa, FL) if the listener omits the article \"The\" in their music tags. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Split+Enz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "See Ya 'Round is the tenth and final studio album by New Zealand's premier new wave band, Split Enz, and was released in 1984, following the departure of founding member Tim Finn, whose solo career had officially taken off the year before. Remaining songwriter Neil Finn, claiming to be a little daunted by the prospect of leading his older brother's band, subsequently announced that this would be the final Split Enz studio recording. Since he only had an EP's worth of material ready, the record was filled out by lightweight, experimental contributions from each of the other band members. In interviews, Neil has revealed that the original EP was to have been the first five tracks on the album (\"Breakin' My Back\" through \"Years Go By\").\n\nNeil Finn's demos from this era included an early version of the future Crowded House hit, \"Something So Strong\" (at this point a ballad), as well as prototypes for \"I Walk Away\" (known as \"Love and Success\" and \"Your Inspiration\"), and \"Can't Carry On\". Tim Finn had also recorded a collection of demos at Sing Sing Studios for the next Enz album, but his departure ensured that they would remain unreleased.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"I Walk Away,\" had a low-budget video clip which features the band protruding their faces through theatrical costume cut-outs, much like on the artwork of the album. The song was also released on a 12\" single, featuring an of-its-era extended remix. Neither single nor album were released in the US, because after most copies of 1983's Conflicting Emotions ended up in bargain bins, the American label A&M would not risk another potential Split Enz failure and dropped them from the roster. \"I Walk Away\" was later re-recorded (with a different verse) and re-released on the U.S. issue of the first Crowded House album, as it was new to U.S. audiences. Originally intended as a goodbye to the Enz, key parts of the song were rewritten for the Crowded House album, supposedly to reflect Neil's uncertainty of venturing away from the security of the Enz.\n\nSee Ya 'Round was initially released only in Australia and New Zealand, charting at #29 and #5, respectively. A later release in Canada featured a grey border on the cover instead of an orange one.\n\nAfter an appearance on Countdown and the release of \"One Mouth Is Fed\" as a follow-up single, the band decided to end with a proper goodbye and beckoned Tim Finn back for one final \"Enz With a Bang\" tour. It is on this tour that Neil met future Crowded House bassist and collaborator, Nick Seymour. A live album was released a year later featuring songs from the three Melbourne shows of this tour and the 1982 Time and Tide tour. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Split+Enz/See+Ya+%27Round\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
