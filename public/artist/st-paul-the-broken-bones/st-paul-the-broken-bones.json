  "biography": "St. Paul and The Broken Bones is a six-piece soul band based in Birmingham, Alabama, United States that formed in 2012. The band is composed of Paul Janeway (vocals), Browan Lollar (guitar), Jesse Phillips (bass), Andrew Lee (drums), Al Gamble (keys), and Allen Branstetter (trumpet). The band tours with both trombone and baritone saxophone as well. \n\nJaneway is a young man who began wailing straight out of the womb, and most folks would agree that he hasn’t stopped since. “Oh what a set of lungs that child has,” they’d say, “he must be destined for something special.” Not wishing to disappoint, and being a good southern boy, Paul began singing in church, stretching his vocal cords with an eye toward becoming a man of the cloth.\n\nThe cloth, however, didn’t appreciate young Paul’s affinity for dirty jokes, Prince, and Tom Waits, and he was inclined to search elsewhere for co-conspirators. He began plying his trade with whomever would have him. With a wholly re-imagined take on the sounds he’d grown up singing and seeking, Paul recruited a rag-tag band of like-minded weirdoes, visionaries, and hacks to help him harness the power he now knew he possessed.
