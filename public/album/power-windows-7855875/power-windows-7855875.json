      "biography": "Rush is a Canadian rock band formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal on their first album, then encompassing hard rock, progressive rock, and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. They have been cited as an influence by various musical artists, including Metallica, Primus, and The Smashing Pumpkins,as well as progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater and Symphony X.\n\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush's sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\nThe band finished the second leg of the Time Machine Tour in July 2011 and released their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels in June 2012 with a supporting tour in the fall.",

            "content": "Power Windows is the eleventh studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1985 . The album was recorded at The Manor in England, Air Studios in Montserrat and at Sarm East in London.\n\nPower Windows introduced more keyboard synthesizers into the band's sound, and featured very precise drumming and guitar. Generally, short, echoey guitar \"bursts\" tend to outnumber solos as well as riffs. The result is a very open and dynamic yet somewhat spartan sound. Although some fans consider the album to be too sterile, others view this period as the pinnacle of the group's career. “The Big Money” and “Mystic Rhythms,” arguably the two most popular songs on the album, were each made into music videos featured in MTV's rotation at the time. Many fans will agree that repeated listening is key to the enjoyment of Power Windows.\n\nPower Windows' lyrics are focused primarily on various manifestations of power, be they overt (nuclear weapons) or personal (frustration at one's lack of power). For example, the song \"Manhattan Project\" explores the origins and consequences of the U.S. military's development of the atomic bomb. \"Territories\" comments on nationalism around the world. Like \"Subdivisions,\" from the album Signals, \"Middletown Dreams\" explores suburban monotony and the average person's attempts to escape it temporarily.\n\nAs a whole, Power Windows represents the peak of Rush’s “synthesizer period,” although the next release, Hold Your Fire, features a similar amount of synthesizers.\n\nBackground\nFebruary 1985, work started at Elora Sound for three weeks, in the barn with a 24 track studio. Bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson were working on songs that fitted to lyrics drummer Neil Peart wrote at a small desk there, and vice versa, Peart writing lyrics that fit songs. He was trying to write the Manhattan Project. Being based on real history, he had to research it. He also wrote rough outlines for The Big Money, Mystic Rhythms and Marathon. Lee and Lifeson sorted through jams and Lifeson’s riff tapes. Those three songs took up to a week. They then began on Middletown Dreams, again Marathon, and then Grand Designs.\n\nIn March, Peart was going through tapes to the five new songs in a Miami hotel room, getting ready for the warm up tour gig in Lakeland, Florida. They met up with engineer James \"Jimbo\" Barton, recommended by producer Peter Collins. Later at Elora, the lyrics Peart was formerly struggling with, Territories and Manhattan Project, began to fall together. Peart was also working on lyrics to a ballad called Emotion Detector. The lyrics seemed to work perfectly with the music they were jamming on at the time. Territories was also arranged, and they had a tape of seven songs. They had trouble with Manhattan Project, but Collins contributed ideas to this and other songs.\n\nApril, at The Manor Studio in England, basic tracks were recorded more quickly than usual, in the span of a few weeks, to capture more spontaneous performances ready for overdubs. Andy Richards was brought in to provide extra keyboard programming and performances. The drum tech was sent to London to pick up African and Indian drums for use on Mystic Rhythms, and bongos were also used on Territories.\n\nIn May, Lifeson began guitar overdubs at Air Studios in Montserrat. Next in June, at Sarm East studios London, he began on guitar solos, and Lee did vocals. They moved to a townhouse in July for mixing, a decision on the track listing, and the artwork, credits, and photos. Strings were recorded for the album by a 30 piece orchestra in Studio 1 at Abbey Road Studios in August. A twenty five piece choir was also recorded at Angel Studios for the ending of Marathon. September, Lee oversaw the mastering in New York, and proofs were approved for the album cover.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll music by Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee and lyrics by Neil Peart.\n\n\nSide one\n\"The Big Money\" – 5:35 \n\"Grand Designs\" – 5:06 \n\"Manhattan Project\" – 5:05 \n\"Marathon\" – 6:09 \n\nSide two\n\"Territories\" – 6:19 \n\"Middletown Dreams\" – 5:15 \n\"Emotion Detector\" – 5:10 \n\"Mystic Rhythms\" – 5:53 \n\nPersonnel\nGeddy Lee - bass guitar, synthesizers, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - electric and acoustic guitars \nNeil Peart - drums, percussion \nAndy Richards - additional keyboards \nAnne Dudley - strings arrangement \nAndrew Jackman - conductor, arrangements \nJim Barton - engineer \nHugh Syme - artwork, cover design \nAlbum Trivia\nThe intro to \"Mystic Rhythms\" was used as the theme music for a news magazine show, \"1986\", which aired on the NBC network (US) and was hosted by Connie Chung. \nThe album art continues Rush's trend of playing on words. The cover shows television sets, which are a type of \"power window\". The subject is using a remote control to operate his sash window. Another illustration of the album shows the front cover's subject looking through another type of 'power window', a set of binoculars. \nThe televisions shown on the cover are a 1949 General Electric Bakelite \"Locomotive\" and two 1958 Predictas  \nIn December 2007 demo recordings of the entire Power Windows album were uploaded onto a Rush Internet forum and are currently being spread and shared by fans. The quality of the demos varies although many appear distorted or \"warped.\" These demo versions of the songs are almost identical in all ways to the finished tracks. \nIn addition to using a Wal bass, Geddy Lee uses a Roland Jupiter 8, PPG Wave 2.3, and a Yamaha DX-7 synthesizer on the album. \n\n Remaster Details\nAlthough the original recording had a SPARS Code of DDD and was considered to be of good quality, a remaster was issued in 1997. The remaster follows the trend of newer albums, as it is considerably louder.\n\nThe tray has a picture of three fingerprints, light blue, pink, and lime green (left to right) with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left. All remasters from Moving Pictures through to A Show of Hands are like this. This is just like the cover art of Retrospective II. \nIncludes original black border around back cover image plus lyrics, credits. \n\n Charts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1985 Pop Albums 10 \n\nSingles\nInformation \n\"The Big Money\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Peter Collins and Rush \nChart positions: #45 US Hot 100; #1 US Mainstream Rock \n \n\"Territories\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Peter Collins and Rush \nChart positions: #30 US Mainstream Rock \n \n\"Mystic Rhythms\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Peter Collins and Rush \nChart positions: #21 US Mainstream Rock \n \n\"Manhattan Project\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Peter Collins and Rush \nChart positions: #10 US Mainstream Rock \n \n\"Marathon\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Peter Collins and Rush \n \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/Power+Windows\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
