      "biography": "Porcupine Tree are a rock band formed by Steven Wilson in 1987 in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England. Their music is associated with both psychedelic rock and progressive rock, yet having been influenced by trance, krautrock and ambient due to Steven Wilson and Richard Barbieri's penchant for the Kosmische Musik scene of the early 1970s, led by bands such as Tangerine Dream, Neu! and Can. Since the early 2000s (decade), their music has been leaning towards progressive metal and alternative rock.\nThe band is noted for its multimedia approach, with its live performances including screens displaying a different film projection to each song. This visual element was introduced during the tour for the In Absentia album, when the band started to work with Danish photographer and filmmaker Lasse Hoile. This involvement created a distinctive image for the band.\nDespite being signed to both Roadrunner and Atlantic labels, the band has their own record label, Transmission, which they use to launch some independent releases and special editions of their albums. In 2007 the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album with their album Fear of a Blank Planet and then again in 2010 with The Incident.\nMusic Radar website placed them amongst \"The 30 greatest live acts in the world today\" (as of 2010), coming at number 4.",

            "content": "In Absentia is the seventh studio album by British progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, first released on September 24, 2002. It was their first release on a major record label, Lava Records.\n\nThough never announced as such by the members of the band, many consider In Absentia to be a concept album. It is said to be an investigation of the causes of insanity and serial killing told through the story of man from childhood through marriage, as many of the songs can demonstrate.\n\nSteven Wilson is always tight-lipped about the meanings of his lyrics largely because (especially on this album) they are loose and open to interpretation. He has said that he means for the lyrics not only to be understood as part of the album's concept (serial killers, rapists, child abusers and other \"deviants\") but also subjectively, according to what the listener brings and assumes about them. For example, the song \"Gravity Eyelids\" has lyrics which seem to suggest connection to the album's concept, but Steven Wilson has also noted that it was written about an \"evening by the Dead Sea.\" The erotic feel of the lyrics also lend themselves to interpretation as a love song.\n\nAside from \"The Sound of Muzak\", which is clearly a criticism of the modern music industry, and \"Wedding Nails\", an instrumental, all of the songs have lyrics that can be linked to the theme. Some seem vague and hard to connect: \"Trains\", which Wilson explained as being an evocation of his memories of childhood summers, includes the lyric \"you're tying me up\", which shares a theme with a line from \"The Creator Has a Mastertape\", a song more clearly about an abusive family relationship.\n\nIn general, the first songs of the album seem lighter and less or more vaguely connected to the concept, as well as being musically lighter and more cheerful. With the eerie \".3\", the album transitions into its darker second section, which contains the songs \"The Creator Has a Mastertape\" and \"Strip the Soul\", which deal more explicitly with a family marred by abuse and murder. One fan reported on the official Porcupine Tree forum that Steven Wilson mentioned the killer Fred West as a notable influence on the album. West had a large family whom he abused physically and sexually, while he and his wife lured many victims to their home to be murdered and often buried in the garden or bricked into the walls of the ever-changing house; this theme appears many times throughout the album. It should be noted that there's a music video for \"Strip the Soul\" that has several grotesque and disturbing images that portray what seems to be a man dismembering a body.\n\nHowever, the meanings of the songs as Steven Wilson meant them are intentionally left open and are fair game for speculation. They are meant to have different meanings and significance to each listener, so an absolute statement about the origin or meaning of one song would be impossible to make.\n\nThis album also marked the arrival of Gavin Harrison, who is their current drummer/percussionist.\n\nDR7 (CD), DR12 (DVD-A) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Porcupine+Tree/In+Absentia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "In Absentia is the seventh studio album by British progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, first released on September 24, 2002. It was their first release on a major record label, Lava Records.\n\nThough never announced as such by the members of the band, many consider In Absentia to be a concept album. It is said to be an investigation of the causes of insanity and serial killing told through the story of man from childhood through marriage, as many of the songs can demonstrate.\n\nSteven Wilson is always tight-lipped about the meanings of his lyrics largely because (especially on this album) they are loose and open to interpretation. He has said that he means for the lyrics not only to be understood as part of the album's concept (serial killers, rapists, child abusers and other \"deviants\") but also subjectively, according to what the listener brings and assumes about them. For example, the song \"Gravity Eyelids\" has lyrics which seem to suggest connection to the album's concept, but Steven Wilson has also noted that it was written about an \"evening by the Dead Sea.\" The erotic feel of the lyrics also lend themselves to interpretation as a love song.\n\nAside from \"The Sound of Muzak\", which is clearly a criticism of the modern music industry, and \"Wedding Nails\", an instrumental, all of the songs have lyrics that can be linked to the theme. Some seem vague and hard to connect: \"Trains\", which Wilson explained as being an evocation of his memories of childhood summers, includes the lyric \"you're tying me up\", which shares a theme with a line from \"The Creator Has a Mastertape\", a song more clearly about an abusive family relationship.\n\nIn general, the first songs of the album seem lighter and less or more vaguely connected to the concept, as well as being musically lighter and more cheerful. With the eerie \".3\", the album transitions into its darker second section, which contains the songs \"The Creator Has a Mastertape\" and \"Strip the Soul\", which deal more explicitly with a family marred by abuse and murder. One fan reported on the official Porcupine Tree forum that Steven Wilson mentioned the killer Fred West as a notable influence on the album. West had a large family whom he abused physically and sexually, while he and his wife lured many victims to their home to be murdered and often buried in the garden or bricked into the walls of the ever-changing house; this theme appears many times throughout the album. It should be noted that there's a music video for \"Strip the Soul\" that has several grotesque and disturbing images that portray what seems to be a man dismembering a body.\n\nHowever, the meanings of the songs as Steven Wilson meant them are intentionally left open and are fair game for speculation. They are meant to have different meanings and significance to each listener, so an absolute statement about the origin or meaning of one song would be impossible to make.\n\nThis album also marked the arrival of Gavin Harrison, who is their current drummer/percussionist.\n\nDR7 (CD), DR12 (DVD-A) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Porcupine+Tree/In+Absentia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
