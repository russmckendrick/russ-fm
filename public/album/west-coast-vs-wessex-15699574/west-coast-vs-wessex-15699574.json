      "biography": "NOFX were an American punk rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. Bassist/lead vocalist Fat Mike, rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin and drummer Erik Sandin were original founding and longest-serving members of the band, who have appeared on every release by the band, although Sandin departed briefly in 1985, only to rejoin the following year. El Hefe joined the band in 1991 to play lead guitar and trumpet, rounding out the best-known iteration of the lineup.\n\nNOFX's mainstream success coincided with increased interest in punk rock during the 1990s; unlike many of their contemporaries, however, they had never been signed to a major label. NOFX released fifteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays and a number of 7\" singles over a career spanning more than four decades. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album Punk in Drublic (1994), which is their only release to receive a gold certification by the RIAA. Their fifteenth and final studio album, Double Album, was released on December 2, 2022. The group has sold over eight million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent bands ever. In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on Fuse entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport. The band retired after a 2024 tour.\n\nStudio albums\nLiberal Animation (1988)\nS&M Airlines (1989)\nRibbed (1991)\nWhite Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean (1992)\nPunk in Drublic (1994)\nHeavy Petting Zoo (1996)\nSo Long and Thanks for All the Shoes (1997)\nPump Up the Valuum (2000)\nThe War on Errorism (2003)\nWolves in Wolves' Clothing (2006)\nCoaster (2009)\nSelf Entitled (2012)\nFirst Ditch Effort (2016)\nSingle Album (2021)\nDouble Album (2022) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/NOFX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography": "Frank Turner (born 28 December 1981) is an English folk/punk singer-songwriter from Meonstoke, Hampshire. Initially the vocalist of post-hardcore band Million Dead, Turner embarked upon a primarily acoustic-based solo career following the band's split in 2005. To date, Turner has released seven solo albums, three rarities compilation albums, one split album and a split EP, and several EPs. Turner's seventh and latest studio album, Be More Kind was released on 4th May 2018.\n\nFrank Turner started solo acoustic shows prior to Million Dead's break up. The first official performance was at the first Small Town America all dayer at 93 Feet East on September 18th 2004. The solo performances were, in a sense, a sideline to Million Dead. They did allow Turner to display some of his own songwriting capabilities (without a band) as well as some covers of songs and bands he enjoyed, in some cases the songs were much re-worked to fit an acoustic atmosphere. Solo performances were also used to help bolster or expose Million Dead to new individuals as well, with some acoustic in-store and radio performances of Million Dead songs.\n\nAt the end of February and start of March (2006) Frank went to Oxford to record the \"Campfire Punkrock\" EP with Dive Dive as the backing band for three of the songs. This EP was released on May 15 2006 on a limited run through Xtra Mile recordings. It sold out after only a few weeks on sale and had to be re-pressed to meet demand.\n\nWith Jonah Matranga doing some touring in June 2006 in support of his CD/DVD album \"Jonah Matranga\" there was some discussion of Frank doing supports with Jonah, this only ended up with one show featuring both at The Peel in Kingston. The discussion however lead to the creation of the Jonah Matranga and Frank Turner split 12\" vinyl. Released in the USA on Welcome Home Records and in the UK via Xtra Mile Recordings. The release features Frank covering two songs by American songwriters and Jonah covering two songs by British songwriters. He was recently (September 18 2006) the last ever artist to perform on BBC Radio 1's Lamacq Live program, unveiling two new songs from \"Sleep Is For The Week\".\n\nThe good sales of \"Campfire Punkrock\" meant good news as this allowed Frank to record his debut album \"Sleep Is For The Week\" in August and September 2006. Recorded in Oxford with Dive Dive as extra band on a selection of the 13 tracks. The last track, \"The Ballad Of Me And My Friends\", is a live recording from a sold out show at the London Barfly and features the vocal contribution of the (approximately) 200 strong audience during a verse. Those in attendance and gave their names to Xtra Mile Recordings will have their names credited as contributers to this track.\n\nIn April 2008, his second album Love, Ire and Song was released to critical acclaim.\n\nHis third full-length album, Poetry Of The Deed, was released September 7th 2009, and includes the singles The Road, Try This At Home and Isabel. An accompanying DVD, Take To The Road, was released in March 2010. \n\nAmidst extensive touring in support of Poetry of the Deed, Turner and his then-untitled backing band recorded Rock & Roll, an EP consisting of tracks written at the same time as Poetry of the Deed alongside new material. Following its release, Turner and the band spent twenty days in January 2011, recording their next studio album with producer Tristan Ivemy. The result was England Keep My Bones, the fourth studio album by Frank, released on June 6, 2011, on Xtra Mile in the United Kingdom, and on June 7, 2011, on Epitaph Records worldwide. Preceded by the single, \"Peggy Sang the Blues\", the album was produced and mixed by Tristan Ivemy, who had previously mixed Love, Ire and Song, Rock & Roll and Campfire Punkrock.\n\nThe album's title is taken from William Shakespeare's play, The Life and Death of King John, with Turner noting, \"I knew that the album was, for the most part, about mortality, and about Englishness. Shakespeare seemed like a good place to go hunting for some pearls of wisdom, and with a little help from my friend Ben we came across this one, and it just seemed to fit the work really well.\"\n\nFollowing the completion of the album, Turner subsequently announced his backing band had named themselves The Sleeping Souls, after a lyric in the track, \"I Am Disappeared\". The Sleeping Souls are Nigel Powell, Ben LLoyd, Tarant Anderson and Matt Nasir.\n\nTurner recorded his fifth studio album in Burbank, California, in October 2012. The reason for recording first time abroad in California was, that producer Rich Costey wouldn't come to England with all his equipment so he convinced Turner to record it in Burbank. Frank Turner announced via Twitter on 28 October 2012 that recording was completed, and mixing and mastering would be done in time for a March 2013 release date. During the November and December UK tour a free CD titled Good Hangs from Xtra Mile Recordings was distributed for free at Frank Turner shows, this included a yet-to-be-released Turner song titled \"Tattoos\" plus the Möngöl Hörde song \"Casual Threats From Weekend Hardmen\". On Christmas Day 2012, the song \"Four Simple Words\" was released on Xtra Mile Recordings' website as a free download along with the b-side \"Cowboy Chords\". On 4 January 2013, a video was shot for what would be the first single. On the same day Frank announced on Twitter that the single was the song \"Recovery\". On 9 January, Frank uploaded a photo to his Instagram page showing the names of all 13 songs that would feature on his new album. This included songs played during the UK and US tours of 2012 such as \"Anymore\", \"Plain Sailing Weather\", \"We Shall Not Overcome\" and \"Tell Tale Signs\". Frank also posted on his fan forum that an extended edition of his new album would be released that includes an extra 5 or 6 songs. On 19 February 2013, it was announced that Turner had signed a licensing deal with Interscope Records in the US for Tape Deck Heart. Following the release of the album Frank Turner embarked on a short U.K tour.\n\n[this section requires expansion, to cover the period 2013 to 2018]\n\nDiscography:\n\n2005 - Frank Turner's Demo\n2007 - Campfire Punkrock\n2007 - The Real Damage\n2007 - Sleep Is For The Week\n2008 - Love Ire & Song\n2008 - The First Three Years\n2009 - Poetry Of The Deed\n2010 - Take to the Road: Live 2009\n2010 - iTunes Festival: London 2010\n2011 - 2011-11-17: Daytrotter Session, Big Orange Studios, Austin, TX, USA\n2012 - The Second Three Years\n2012 - Last Minutes and Lost Evenings\n2013 - Tape Deck Heart\n2014 - Polaroid Picture\n2014 - The Third Three Years\n2015 - Positive Songs for Negative People\n2017 - Songbook\n2018 - Be More Kind\n2019 - No Man's Land\n2020 - West Coast vs. Wessex\n2020 - Buddies II: Still Buddies <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Turner\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
