      "biography": "William John Paul \"Liam\" Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He rose to fame as the lead singer of the rock band Oasis, and later as the singer of Beady Eye, before performing as a solo artist after the dissolution of both previous bands. His erratic behaviour, distinctive singing style, and abrasive attitude have been the subject of commentary in the press; he remains one of the most recognisable figures in modern British music.\n\nAlthough his older brother Noel wrote the majority of Oasis' songs, Liam penned the singles \"Songbird\" and \"I'm Outta Time\", along with a string of album tracks and B-sides. Noel departed Oasis in 2009 and formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, while Liam continued with the other former members of Oasis under the Beady Eye name until they disbanded in 2014. His debut solo album As You Were was released 6 October 2017.\n\nGallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 reader poll by Q magazine.\n\nWilliam John Paul Gallagher was born in Burnage, Manchester, to Irish parents Thomas and Peggy Gallagher. Liam was abused by his father as a child, and although his older brothers Noel and Paul took the most abuse, Liam has said that the abuse affected him deeply and inspired him to become an artist. When Liam was 10, Peggy took the boys and moved away from Thomas (she divorced him in 1986). Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, he has said that their issues remain unresolved.\n\nPaul and Noel often contend that even from a young age, Liam went out of his way to antagonise people, especially Noel, with whom he shared a bedroom. The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens. Liam often stole bicycles from local shops. He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury; despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in Spring 1990. He gained 4 GCSEs.\n\nNoel has said that Liam showed little interest in music until his late teens, also that Liam was better looking than him, a better singer, had better clothes and could pull off a parka jacket better. Gallagher became confident in his ability to sing and began listening to bands like the Beatles, the Stone Roses, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, and T.Rex. In the process he forged a lifelong obsession with former Beatles singer/songwriter John Lennon; Liam would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon re-incarnated, despite being born eight years prior to Lennon's death.\n\nOn 26 July 2015 Gallagher appeared at an Irish pub in Charlestown, County Mayo playing a number of songs, including an early version of his new song 'Bold', in front of pub guests with an acoustic guitar. However, on 4 January 2016, he said on Twitter that he has no plans to pursue a solo career, writing, \"Solo record are you fucking tripping dickhead im not a cunt LG X.\" However, in a 2016 interview with Q Magazine, he officially announced he would be releasing songs in 2017 although he doesn't consider it a solo career, advising they're just songs that he has written over the years that he'd like to release. Gallagher made reference to the previously mentioned tweet, by stating \"It's official I'm a cunt LG x\" via Twitter.\n\nA solo appearance at Norwegian festival Bergenfest in 2017 was announced in November 2016, with other festival appearances for summer 2017 later confirmed. It was announced in March 2017 that the debut solo album was to be titled As You Were. On 26 May 2017, he announced the release of his solo debut single \"Wall of Glass\" on 1 June 2017, however it was released a day earlier on 31 May with an accompanying music video. In the same month, Gallagher performed his first solo concert at the Ritz in Manchester with all proceeds going to victims of the Manchester terror attack.\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Gallagher made a surprise appearance at the One Love Manchester benefit concert where he played \"Rock 'N' Roll Star\", \"Wall of Glass\" and \"Live Forever\" with Coldplay's Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland. Gallagher performed at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany in June 2017. In the same month he performed at the Pinkpop festival in the Netherlands. After a management dispute in early 2017, Gallagher has been represented by his nephew, Australian born Daniel Nicholas.\n\nGallagher performed at Glastonbury in June 2017. During the set he sang \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" for the first time, dedicating his performance to the victims of the recent Manchester and London terror attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire. On 30 June 2017, he released his second solo single \"Chinatown\". In July 2017, he performed at the Exit festival in Serbia and Benicassim festival in Spain.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Gallagher performed at Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and left the stage in the middle of a song after performing for only 20 minutes. He later apologized on Twitter and claimed he had vocal problems. On 10 August 2017 \"For What It's Worth\" was released, a song Gallagher described as an \"apology\" saying \"...I've made a lot of mistakes...I guess it is an apology to whoever. I've pissed a lot of people off\". He performed this song on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on 14 August 2017.",

      "editorial_notes": "There had been moments when John Squire wondered how little the future held for him as a musician. In 2020, a thumb he’d broken while playing basketball with his son was struggling to heal and he worried he might never be able to play guitar again. Before that, The Stone Roses—the Manchester band with which he’d helped to completely dilate the horizons of indie music during the late ’80s and early ’90s—had seemed to wither to a final close when their 2016-17 reunion produced two new songs but no desire on any member’s part to make another album. Going into the 2020s, Squire seemed more consumed by his work as a visual artist.\n\nNevertheless, in early 2022, his thumb righted by physiotherapy, Squire had a nagging sense that he wasn’t quite done with music. “I started thinking I’d like to get back out there,” he told Apple Music’ Radio’s Zane Lowe. “‘Have I still got it in me?’ I started putting some ideas together. I wouldn’t say they were songs, they were more like glorified riffs.” He’d had a thought that he might find a female singer to help flesh out those ideas, but then his guest appearance at Liam Gallagher’s Knebworth concert that June sparked a different idea: What if he asked the Oasis man to sing them? It was a question worth asking. Before the end of the year, Gallagher was in Squire’s home studio in Macclesfield, recording demos and igniting Squire’s creative zeal again. “On paper, it’s a slam dunk but to actually hear it and feel that magic was amazing,” said Squire. “The buzz for me has always been that moment of conception when you realise you’ve got something great. When you’re doing that within the framework of a band and an album and gigs, you know all that’s coming down the line at you once you’ve completed the song—there’s nothing better than that feeling. It’s like, ‘I’m the first person that’s heard this and it’s going to travel, it’s going to be released into the wild and do some damage.’”\n\nFor his part, Gallagher was just chuffed to be working with one of his musical heroes. “John going, ‘Look, I’m back to writing songs and that again,’ made me happy regardless of me singing on them,” Gallagher told Lowe. “These songs came my way and I was double pleased to sing them. I love them. I think John’s equally as good [at songwriting] as he is playing a guitar. I’m sure people know that anyway, but it’s nice if more people get to know it.” You can sense the duo’s mutual satisfaction in an album that was recorded over a two-week period in LA with producer Greg Kurstin, a collaborator on Gallagher’s three solo records. While the core elements are familiar—Squire’s roaming, nimble guitar lines, Gallagher’s serrated voice—nothing feels tired or overcooked. Instead, buoyed by the strength of Squire’s melodies, the two turn in performances that might be their best since the Roses and Oasis heydays. Writing the words and music, Squire gives Gallagher moods and colours he’s always worked well with—sneering disdain (“I’m so Bored”), sore-headed yearning (“Mars to Liverpool”) and measured psychedelia (“Love You Forever”)—and successfully coaxes him onto relatively new ground (the blues on “I’m a Wheel”).\n\nThe world’s recording studios are littered with the ghosts and abandoned recordings of stellar collaborations that should have worked on paper but didn’t create any chemistry on tape. Gallagher thinks his particular super-duo has succeeded for a simple reason. “John’s guitars are lairy, man, and my vocals can be as well,” he said. “I think it lends well to it. [It’s not that] one’s light and one’s heavy. They’re both just fucking coming at you.”",
