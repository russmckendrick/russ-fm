      "biography": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band, active in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in the history of music.\nAfter changing their name, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. Led Zeppelin disliked the releasing of tracks as singles, preferring their albums to be viewed as indivisible, whole listening experiences, helping to promote the concept of album-orientated rock. Their first two albums, with their heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound, led to Led Zeppelin being regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, even though the band's individualistic style drew from varied sources and transcends any single music genre. Their next two albums incorporated wider musical influences, particularly from folk music; the fourth, untitled album, which featured the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars\". Subsequent albums saw greater musical experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which, like the group's previous tours, earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's sudden death in 1980.",

      "editorial_notes": "After releasing two gargantuan albums and trekking across the country on a nonstop touring schedule, Led Zeppelin needed an escape from 1969. To refresh the band members’ energy and conjure new musical spirits, the group relocated to a rustic 18th-century Welsh cottage named Bron-Yr-Aur in January 1970. The only song the band finished there was “That’s the Way”, which introduced a richly produced delicateness to Zeppelin’s palette, building from <i>Led Zeppelin II</i>’s muted “Thank You”. Jimmy Page’s acoustic tendencies had been mostly latent, save his refiguring of Scottish finger-picker Bert Jansch’s “Blackwaterside” as “Black Mountain Side” on the band’s debut album. But when <i>Led Zeppelin III</i> was released in 1970, the album featured a three-track run of acoustic tunes: “Tangerine”, “That’s The Way” and “Bron-Y-Aur Stomp”, a buoyant front-porch jam about Robert Plant’s dog. Anyone hearing the band for the first time could be forgiven for assuming they were listening to the latest Laurel Canyon folk-rock strivers.\n\nStrummy acoustic shift notwithstanding, this was still Led Zeppelin. By now the band’s reputation as marauding metal buccaneers was preceding them, and <i>Led Zeppelin III</i>’s darker parts demonstrate how the band members’ rustic reboot invested their hardest music with an earthy historicism. For a lesser group, opening your album by strapping on a horned helmet to dramatise the Viking raids on the British Isles would melt into cartoonish Dark Ages role-play. But this is Zeppelin at peak power, and between Page’s thunderous riffage and Plant’s Nordic wail, “Immigrant Song” is a heavy-metal war cry that hits with the force of an axe to the skull.\n\nWhile nothing else rocks nearly as hard on <i>Led Zeppelin III</i>, a tangible dread floats through the album, most notably on “Gallows Pole”, a frenzied folk-metal plea from a condemned man that the band culled from a Smithsonian Folkways compilation. Then there’s “Since I’ve Been Loving You”, the band’s finest original blues tune, and the sweltering “Friends”, which wafts out of the speaker on the thick, pungent aroma of John Paul Jones’ Moog drone. Led Zeppelin’s first two albums were made quickly; <i>Led Zeppelin III</i> is the first time the band let their music simmer, and the music’s tone and scope expanded as well.",

            "content": "Led Zeppelin III, the third album by English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was recorded between January and July 1970 and was released October 5, 1970 by Atlantic Records.\n\nLed Zeppelin III marked a change in focus for the band from late 1960s hard rock to a more folk rock and acoustic inspired sound. These styles had been present to a lesser degree in the band's first two releases, but here it was the main style - and one that would remain prominent in the group's later albums. This change in direction endeared the band to many progressive rock fans who would never have listened to Led Zeppelin's established blues and rock repertoire. With Led Zeppelin III the group's songwriting dynamic also changed, from Page's domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic affair in which all four group members offered up their own compositions and ideas - patterns that would continue in future sessions.\n\nThe album contains two songs which became key components of the band's live concert performances for many years: \"Immigrant Song\" and \"Since I've Been Loving You\". The first of these, written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, is about the Norse invasions of England and was inspired by the band's recent live performance in Iceland. \"Since I've Been Loving You\" is a classic, original blues in the key C minor featuring heartfelt interplay by all four group members. It would become a performance staple, especially from 1971 through 1973, replacing Willie Dixon's \"I Can't Quit You Baby\" from the first album as the band's slow blues showcase.\n\nThe album also featured the rock songs \"Celebration Day\" and \"Out on the Tiles\", and the acoustic tracks \"Bron-Yr-Aur (Stomp)\" and \"That's the Way\", the latter considered by Page to be a breakthrough for still-developing lyric writer Plant. The song \"Gallows Pole\" is actually an arrangement of a traditional folk song by that name, also recorded by Lead Belly some thirty years earlier.\n\nThe album finishes with \"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\", a track dedicated to their influential contemporary, Roy Harper, that both honours Harper’s work and acknowledges the band’s roots in acoustic music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Led+Zeppelin+III\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
