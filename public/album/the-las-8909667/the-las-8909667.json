      "biography": "The La's are an English rock band from Liverpool, originally active from the early 1980s to early 1990s. Fronted by singer, songwriter and guitarist Lee Mavers, the group is most famous for their hit single \"There She Goes\". The band was formed by Mike Badger in 1983 and Mavers joined soon after although for most of the group's history, the frequently changing line-up revolved around the core duo of Lee Mavers (vocals, guitar) and John Power (bass, backing vocals) along with numerous other guitarists and drummers including Paul Hemmings, Chris Sharrock, Barry Sutton, Neil Mavers and Peter \"Cammy\" Camell.\n\nAfter the departure of Badger in late 1986, the band signed to Go! Discs in 1987 and commenced recording of their debut album. Following the release of singles \"Way Out\" (1987), \"There She Goes\" (1988) and \"Timeless Melody\" (1990) and having aborted several recording sessions with different producers, the band released their debut album The La's in 1990 to critical acclaim and modest commercial success. John Power left The La's to form Cast and the group entered a prolonged hiatus in 1992 which lasted almost two decades. The group later reformed briefly in the mid-1990s, 2005 and 2011. However, no new recordings have been released.",

The final sessions for the album were recorded December 1989 – February 1990 at Eden Studios in London with producers Steve Lillywhite and Mark Wallis. \"There She Goes\" is a remixed version of the original single recording produced by Bob Andrews in 1988. The La's first single song, Way Out, was re-recorded for the album.\n\nAccording to the liner notes in the Deluxe edition from 2008, The La's did 12 different sessions between July 1987 and May 1990.\n\nIn July 1987, Matrix studio, London, John Porter produced \"Doledrum\", \"Son of a Gun\", \"Failure\" and \"Jams\". \"Doledrum\" appears on the deluxe edition.\n\nIn August–September 1987, Townhouse studio, London, Gavin McKillop produced \"Way Out\", \"Endless\" and \"Knock Me Down\"In October 1987, Ezee Studios, London, Dave Allen produced Doledrum, still unreleased.\n\nIn October 1987, Fall out shelter, London, Andy MacDonald produced a remixed \"Way out\" single.

In May 1990, Townhouse studio, London, Steve Lillywhite produced 6 tracks in a mixing session for the album.\n\nThe album released is largely from the Steve Lillywhite sessions, although some backing vocals appear to be from the Hedges sessions, something Lee Mavers complained about on Rapido TV.\n\n\"The La's\" was released in 1990 on Go! Discs in the United Kingdom and in 1991 on London Records in the United States. The album was praised by critics and embraced by fans. It was the result of nearly three years in the studio with a string of acclaimed producers. Each attempted to capture the sound sought by Lee Mavers, the lead singer and principal songwriter of the band. However, due to Mavers' exacting expectations, the sound eluded each of the producers, and the album eventually released was immediately disowned by the band.\n\nA new version of the album, recorded by Mike Hedges (who has also worked with U2, Manic Street Preachers and the Cure) was found on a cassette; this new version was digitally remastered and released for the first time as part of \"The La's: Deluxe Edition\". This edition also includes previously unreleased archive recordings and radio sessions by the band, as well as deluxe packaging and expanded sleevenotes.\n\nIn 2013, NME ranked \"The La's\" at number 153 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2016, Rolling Stone placed the record at number 13 on its list of the \"40 Greatest One-Album Wonders\". \"The La's\" was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". Noel Gallagher of Oasis named it as one of his 13 favourite albums. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+La%27s/The+La%27s\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Discs in the United Kingdom and in 1991 on London Records in the United States. The album was praised by critics and embraced by fans. It was the result of nearly three years in the studio with a string of acclaimed producers. Each attempted to capture the sound sought by Lee Mavers, the lead singer and principal songwriter of the band. However, due to Mavers' exacting expectations, the sound eluded each of the producers, and the album eventually released was immediately disowned by the band.\n\nA new version of the album, recorded by Mike Hedges (who has also worked with U2, Manic Street Preachers and the Cure) was found on a cassette; this new version was digitally remastered and released for the first time as part of \"The La's: Deluxe Edition\". This edition also includes previously unreleased archive recordings and radio sessions by the band, as well as deluxe packaging and expanded sleevenotes.\n\nIn 2013, NME ranked \"The La's\" at number 153 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2016, Rolling Stone placed the record at number 13 on its list of the \"40 Greatest One-Album Wonders\". \"The La's\" was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". Noel Gallagher of Oasis named it as one of his 13 favourite albums. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+La%27s/The+La%27s\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
