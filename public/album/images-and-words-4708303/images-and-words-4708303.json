      "biography": "Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to further concentrate on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for Portnoy's replacement drummer. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.\n\nThe band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the \"Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time\" by GuitarOne magazine. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 23 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nThe band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached #61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at #32 and #46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album (as of March, 2003) by Classic Rock Magazine. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. In 2007, Systematic Chaos entered U.S. Billboard 200 at #19. By 2008, Dream Theater had sold over 2.1 million albums in the U.S. and by 2011, over 12 million records worldwide.\n\nThe band's eleventh studio album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, was released on September 13, 2011. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 at #8, two positions lower than their previous release Black Clouds & Silver Linings which entered the Billboard 200 chart at #6. The album is the band's first with Mike Mangini, since Mike Portnoy's departure. On November 30, 2011 it was announced that On the Backs of Angels was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination.",

            "content": "Images and Words is the second studio album by influential American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released in 1992. It was recorded in late 1991 at BearTracks Studios in New York City. The album is the first album to feature James LaBrie on vocals. The album maintains its position as the band's most commercially successful album to date, and the song Pull Me Under's status as the only Top 10 hit the band has ever had. This song has also had some very recent success as it has appeared in the video game Guitar Hero: World Tour. Many critics and fans cite this album as a landmark release for the progressive metal genre.\n\n\nHistory\nAfter Charlie Dominici's departure from the band, they auditioned nearly 200 people across the nation before James LaBrie sent the band an audition tape. LaBrie was formerly in the Canadian glam metal band Winter Rose, but saw potential in the band, and thus decided to audition. After a short jam session, the band chose him as their lead singer, and he has been the band's lead singer ever since.\n\nWith LaBrie on board, the band was signed to a seven album contract by Atco Records, and shortly after began recording their new album. The lead single, Pull Me Under gained the band considerable commercial success with its airplay on MTV and radio, garnering them a Top 10 hit on radio charts. When the album was released, it sold at a steady pace, only helped by their relentless touring across the world. Images and Words would go on to be the band's most commercially successful album, and often is considered a landmark release in the progressive metal genre by many newer bands in the genre such as Tool.\n\nImages and Words was played in its entirety, on several occasions, during the European leg of the \"Chaos in Motion\" tour, in celebration of its 15th anniversary.\n\nReception\nImages and Words has garnered overwhelmingly positive critical and fan acclaim. As of July 5, 2008, heavy metal database The Metal Archives ranks Images and Words as Dream Theater's second best album with a 92% rating based on 11 fan reviews. Murat Batmaz of the popular progressive rock/metal review website Sea of Tranquility awarded the record a perfect score, calling it a \"masterpiece\" and \"the most important Dream Theater album, ever\".\n\nImages and Words is currently ranked #2 on Digital Dream Door's list of the top 100 progressive metal albums of all time .\n\n\n\n1. \"Pull Me Under\"   Kevin Moore Dream Theater 8:15 \n2. \"Another Day\"   John Petrucci Dream Theater 4:24 \n3. \"Take the Time\"   Dream Theater Dream Theater 8:21 \n4. \"Surrounded\"   Moore Dream Theater 5:30 \n5. \"Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\"   Petrucci Dream Theater 9:32 \n6. \"Under a Glass Moon\"   Petrucci Dream Theater 7:04 \n7. \"Wait for Sleep\"   Moore Moore 2:32 \n8. \"Learning to Live\"   John Myung Dream Theater 11:31 \n\n\nBand\nJames LaBrie – Vocals \nKevin Moore – Keyboards \nJohn Myung – Bass guitar \nJohn Petrucci – Guitar \nMike Portnoy – Drums and percussion \n\nGuest\nJay Beckenstein – Soprano saxophone on \"Another Day\" \nRIAA Certifications\nThese statistics were compiled from the RIAA certification online database.\n\nGold - February 2, 1995 \nChart Performance\nSingles\n\nYear Single Mainstream Rock Tracks \n1992 \"Pull Me Under\" #10 \n1992 \"Another Day\" #29 \n1992 \"Take the Time\" #22 \n\nBillboard 200:\n\nImages and Words - #61 \nTop Heatseekers:\n\nImages and Words - #2 \nGreatest Guitar Solos of All Time:\n\n\"Under a Glass Moon\" - #98 \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater/Images+and+Words\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
