  "biography": "Matt Berry (born 1974 in Bromham, Bedfordshire) is a British actor, writer and musician known for his deep, booming voice and a grand, rather roguish but charming manner. When not creating numerous indelible characters on a variety of British and American TV shows, multi-instrumentalist Matt Berry spends his time re-creating the sounds of the obscure albums he collects on songs that blend gentle British folk, wistful psychedelia, and rambling prog rock. Teaming with the venerable Acid Jazz label, Berry released a series of albums that explored pastoral folk-rock (2013's Kill the Wolf), new age synthesizer music (2014's Music for Insomniacs), country-rock (2020's Phantom Birds), and spot-on psychedelia (2021's Blue Elephant.) No matter the stylistic route he chooses, Berry plays it straight, and his surprisingly tender vocals, skills at a variety of instruments, and knack for a hook make it clear that he's not just an actor dabbling in music as a hobby. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Berry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "profile": "Born in May 2, 1974, Bromham, Bedfordshire, England, Matt Berry is an actor, voice actor and musician best known for his roles on the British sitcoms [i]The IT Crowd[/i], [i]The Mighty Boosh[/i], [i]What We Do In The Shadows[/i],  [i]Toast Of London[/i] and [i]Toast In Tinseltown[/i]. Along with Rich Fulcher, he created and starred in the cult comedy series [i]Snuff Box[/i], which featured songs written and composed by Berry. He also wrote the 2004 parody rock opera [i]AD/BC[/i] for BBC Three.\r\n\r\nAs well as an actor, Berry also has a very colourful musical career, most of which through the label [l997]. The majority of his music is self composed, but every now and then, he has input from his band The Maypoles, who also perform live on his concerts. His most famous song is Take My Hand, as used in Snuff Box during the Elton John sketch, and in Toast Of London as the main theme. Berry's music style varies from progressive to experimental folk, all tied together with an electronic feel, with various reccurring melodies. He has also written music for TV and has contributed to the [i]Strictly Come Dancing[/i] theme song.",

        "profile": "Born in May 2, 1974, Bromham, Bedfordshire, England, Matt Berry is an actor, voice actor and musician best known for his roles on the British sitcoms [i]The IT Crowd[/i], [i]The Mighty Boosh[/i], [i]What We Do In The Shadows[/i],  [i]Toast Of London[/i] and [i]Toast In Tinseltown[/i]. Along with Rich Fulcher, he created and starred in the cult comedy series [i]Snuff Box[/i], which featured songs written and composed by Berry. He also wrote the 2004 parody rock opera [i]AD/BC[/i] for BBC Three.\r\n\r\nAs well as an actor, Berry also has a very colourful musical career, most of which through the label [l997]. The majority of his music is self composed, but every now and then, he has input from his band The Maypoles, who also perform live on his concerts. His most famous song is Take My Hand, as used in Snuff Box during the Elton John sketch, and in Toast Of London as the main theme. Berry's music style varies from progressive to experimental folk, all tied together with an electronic feel, with various reccurring melodies. He has also written music for TV and has contributed to the [i]Strictly Come Dancing[/i] theme song.",

      "bio_content": "Matt Berry (born 1974 in Bromham, Bedfordshire) is a British actor, writer and musician known for his deep, booming voice and a grand, rather roguish but charming manner. When not creating numerous indelible characters on a variety of British and American TV shows, multi-instrumentalist Matt Berry spends his time re-creating the sounds of the obscure albums he collects on songs that blend gentle British folk, wistful psychedelia, and rambling prog rock. Teaming with the venerable Acid Jazz label, Berry released a series of albums that explored pastoral folk-rock (2013's Kill the Wolf), new age synthesizer music (2014's Music for Insomniacs), country-rock (2020's Phantom Birds), and spot-on psychedelia (2021's Blue Elephant.) No matter the stylistic route he chooses, Berry plays it straight, and his surprisingly tender vocals, skills at a variety of instruments, and knack for a hook make it clear that he's not just an actor dabbling in music as a hobby. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Berry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
