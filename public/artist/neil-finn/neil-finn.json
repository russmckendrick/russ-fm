  "biography": "Neil Mullane Finn, OBE (born 27 May 1958) is a New Zealand recording artist. Along with his brother Tim Finn, he was the co-frontman for Split Enz and is now frontman for Crowded House. He has also recorded several successful solo albums and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide projects.\n\nFinn rose to prominence in the late 1970s after replacing singer songwriter Phil Judd in his brother Tim Finn's band Split Enz. With the group, Finn wrote the hits \"One Step Ahead\", \"History Never Repeats\", \"I Got You\" and \"Message to My Girl\", among others. Finn rose from prominence to international fame after Split Enz broke up in 1984. While his brother Tim Finn left for England, Neil was the founder of Crowded House with Split Enz's final drummer Paul Hester in 1985. The group achieved international success in 1987 when they released the single \"Don't Dream It's Over\" written by Neil.\n\nHe ended Crowded House in 1996 to embark upon what was to become a moderately successful solo career, and has released two albums with his brother Tim under the title the Finn Brothers. In 2006, following the death of Hester, Finn reformed Crowded House (adding Beck's former drummer Matt Sherrod) and released their first studio album in over 13 years, Time on Earth, and the band began a world tour. In 2010, Finn commenced another world tour with Crowded House in support of their 2010 release, Intriguer.",

      "biography_de": "Neil Mullane Finn (* 27. Mai 1958 in Te Awamutu) ist ein neuseeländischer Rockmusiker mit irischen Vorfahren.\n\nFinn singt, spielt Gitarre und Klavier und ist Pop-Songwriter. Einem größeren Publikum bekannt wurde er als Sänger und hauptsächlicher Songschreiber der Bands Split Enz und Crowded House. Unter Kritikern gilt er als einer der wichtigsten Songwriter seiner Generation. \n(Wikipedia)",
      "biography_en": "Neil Mullane Finn, OBE (born 27 May 1958) is a New Zealand recording artist. Along with his brother Tim Finn, he was the co-frontman for Split Enz and is now frontman for Crowded House. He has also recorded several successful solo albums and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide projects.\n\nFinn rose to prominence in the late 1970s after replacing singer songwriter Phil Judd in his brother Tim Finn's band Split Enz. With the group, Finn wrote the hits \"One Step Ahead\", \"History Never Repeats\", \"I Got You\" and \"Message to My Girl\", among others. Finn rose from prominence to international fame after Split Enz broke up in 1984. While his brother Tim Finn left for England, Neil was the founder of Crowded House with Split Enz's final drummer Paul Hester in 1985. The group achieved international success in 1987 when they released the single \"Don't Dream It's Over\" written by Neil.\n\nHe ended Crowded House in 1996 to embark upon what was to become a moderately successful solo career, and has released two albums with his brother Tim under the title the Finn Brothers. In 2006, following the death of Hester, Finn reformed Crowded House (adding Beck's former drummer Matt Sherrod) and released their first studio album in over 13 years, Time on Earth, and the band began a world tour. In 2010, Finn commenced another world tour with Crowded House in support of their 2010 release, Intriguer.",

Along with his brother Tim Finn, he was the co-frontman for Split Enz and is now the frontman for Crowded House. He has also recorded several successful solo albums, recorded two albums with his brother as the Finn Brothers, and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide projects.\n\nFinn is said to have decided to become a musician at the age of 12 and throughout his school years performed in hospitals and prisons, as well as at home gatherings. In 1976 he formed a group known as After Hours with Mark Hough, Geoff Chunn and Alan Brown. The following year, in 1977, Finn was invited to London to join Split Enz, the band formed by his elder brother, Tim Finn. Split Enz broke up in 1984 and Neil Finn formed a new band, Crowded House, with several other Australian and New Zealand musicians.\n\nCrowded House had a string of hits over the next 10 years, releasing four albums and culminating in a concert in the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. Finn went solo after this, releasing several albums as well as two albums with his brother Tim (Finn Brothers).\n\nIn 2007, Finn re-united Crowded House and released a new album, Time on Earth, and the band began a world tour. In 2010, another new album, \"Intriguer\", was released and coincided with another world tour.\n\nIn 2012, Finn recorded the track \"Song of the Lonely Mountain\", which was featured in the end credits of the movie \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Finn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Einem größeren Publikum bekannt wurde er als Sänger und hauptsächlicher Songschreiber der Bands Split Enz und Crowded House. Unter Kritikern gilt er als einer der wichtigsten Songwriter seiner Generation. \n(Wikipedia)",
      "biography_en": "Neil Mullane Finn, OBE (born 27 May 1958) is a New Zealand recording artist. Along with his brother Tim Finn, he was the co-frontman for Split Enz and is now frontman for Crowded House. He has also recorded several successful solo albums and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide projects.\n\nFinn rose to prominence in the late 1970s after replacing singer songwriter Phil Judd in his brother Tim Finn's band Split Enz. With the group, Finn wrote the hits \"One Step Ahead\", \"History Never Repeats\", \"I Got You\" and \"Message to My Girl\", among others. Finn rose from prominence to international fame after Split Enz broke up in 1984. While his brother Tim Finn left for England, Neil was the founder of Crowded House with Split Enz's final drummer Paul Hester in 1985. The group achieved international success in 1987 when they released the single \"Don't Dream It's Over\" written by Neil.\n\nHe ended Crowded House in 1996 to embark upon what was to become a moderately successful solo career, and has released two albums with his brother Tim under the title the Finn Brothers. In 2006, following the death of Hester, Finn reformed Crowded House (adding Beck's former drummer Matt Sherrod) and released their first studio album in over 13 years, Time on Earth, and the band began a world tour. In 2010, Finn commenced another world tour with Crowded House in support of their 2010 release, Intriguer.",
