  "biography": "Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American jazz musician, trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. Widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion.\n\nOn October 7, 2008, his 1959 album Kind of Blue received its fourth platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of at least four million copies in the United States. Miles Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Davis was noted as \"one of the key figures in the history of jazz\". On December 15, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution recognizing and commemorating the album Kind of Blue on its 50th anniversary, \"honoring the masterpiece and reaffirming jazz as a national treasure.\"",

      "profile": "Trumpeter, bandleader, and composer\r\nBorn May 26, 1926 in Alton, Illinois, USA, died September 28, 1991 in Santa Monica, California, USA (aged 65)\r\n\r\nOne of the most important figures in jazz history, Davis adopted multiple musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. His album \"[m=5460]\" (1959) is the highest selling jazz album ever with over five million copies sold.\r\n\r\nMiles settled in New York City to study at Juilliard School. He made his professional debut as a member of [a272028] from 1944 to 1948. In 1948, Davis began to found his own ensembles. At that time, he met [a255137], who contributed to [a497768]'s scores and arrangements. The dozen sides they recorded in 1949-50 were eventually assembled as the LP \"[m=62308]\" (1957), with Davis and Evans working together again from 1957 on further projects.\r\n\r\nMiles Davis was prominent in the creation of the 'Hard Bop' style in the mid-1950s (his first regular quintet featured [a97545]), and the \"time, no changes\" approach in his second quintet a decade later. In the late 1960s, he introduced electronic instruments and rock and funk rhythms in his music. Around 1975, he went on a hiatus over health and personal problems, re-emerging in 1980.\r\n\r\nHe married dancer/actress [a7671712] on December 12, 1959; the couple divorced in 1968. He then married singer [a1076460] in September 1968; they divorced in 1970. He then married actress [a6279083] on November 26, 1981; they divorced in 1989. Father of [a680784] and [a1493787]. Uncle of [a279708] (Jr).\r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 (Performer).\r\n\r\nWinner of eight Grammy Awards:\r\n- Best Jazz Composition Of More Than Five Minutes Duration for Sketches Of Spain on [m=48172]\r\n- Best Jazz Performance - Large Group Or Soloist With Large Group for [m=8260]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist for [m=65130]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist for [m=63355]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Big Band for [m=62288]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist (On A Jazz Recording) for [m=62288]\r\n- Best R&B Instrumental Performance for [m=62359]\r\n- Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance for [m=188032]",

        "profile": "Trumpeter, bandleader, and composer\r\nBorn May 26, 1926 in Alton, Illinois, USA, died September 28, 1991 in Santa Monica, California, USA (aged 65)\r\n\r\nOne of the most important figures in jazz history, Davis adopted multiple musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. His album \"[m=5460]\" (1959) is the highest selling jazz album ever with over five million copies sold.\r\n\r\nMiles settled in New York City to study at Juilliard School. He made his professional debut as a member of [a272028] from 1944 to 1948. In 1948, Davis began to found his own ensembles. At that time, he met [a255137], who contributed to [a497768]'s scores and arrangements. The dozen sides they recorded in 1949-50 were eventually assembled as the LP \"[m=62308]\" (1957), with Davis and Evans working together again from 1957 on further projects.\r\n\r\nMiles Davis was prominent in the creation of the 'Hard Bop' style in the mid-1950s (his first regular quintet featured [a97545]), and the \"time, no changes\" approach in his second quintet a decade later. In the late 1960s, he introduced electronic instruments and rock and funk rhythms in his music. Around 1975, he went on a hiatus over health and personal problems, re-emerging in 1980.\r\n\r\nHe married dancer/actress [a7671712] on December 12, 1959; the couple divorced in 1968. He then married singer [a1076460] in September 1968; they divorced in 1970. He then married actress [a6279083] on November 26, 1981; they divorced in 1989. Father of [a680784] and [a1493787]. Uncle of [a279708] (Jr).\r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 (Performer).\r\n\r\nWinner of eight Grammy Awards:\r\n- Best Jazz Composition Of More Than Five Minutes Duration for Sketches Of Spain on [m=48172]\r\n- Best Jazz Performance - Large Group Or Soloist With Large Group for [m=8260]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist for [m=65130]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist for [m=63355]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Big Band for [m=62288]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist (On A Jazz Recording) for [m=62288]\r\n- Best R&B Instrumental Performance for [m=62359]\r\n- Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance for [m=188032]",

Many well-known musicians rose to prominence as members of Davis\\' ensembles, including saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, George Coleman, Wayne Shorter, Dave Liebman, Branford Marsalis and Kenny Garrett; trombonist J. J. Johnson; pianists Horace Silver, Red Garland, Wynton Kelly, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Keith Jarrett; guitarists John McLaughlin, John Scofield and Mike Stern; bassists Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, Marcus Miller and Darryl Jones, ; and drummers Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, Jack DeJohnette, and Al Foster.\\n\\nMiles Davis was born on May 26, 1926, to a relatively affluent family in Alton, Illinois. His father, Dr. Miles Henry Davis, was a dentist. In 1927 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They also owned a substantial ranch in northern Arkansas, where Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.\\n\\nDavis\\' mother, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but kept this fact hidden from her son. His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan. Davis later suggested that his father\\'s instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet\\'s sound. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato; he was reported to have slapped Davis\\' knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato. Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, \"I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything.\" Clark Terry was another important early influence.\\n\\nBy age 16, Davis was a member of the music society and playing professionally when not at school. At 17, he spent a year playing in Eddie Randle\\'s band, the Blue Devils. During this time, Sonny Stitt tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, then passing through town, but Davis\\' mother insisted that he finish his final year of high school.\\n\\nIn 1944, the Billy Eckstine band visited East St. Louis. Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were members of the band, and Davis was brought in on third trumpet for a couple of weeks because the regular player, Buddy Anderson, was out sick. Even after this experience, once Eckstine\\'s band left town, Davis\\' parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies.\\n\\nIn the fall of 1944, following graduation from high school, Davis moved to New York City to study at the Juilliard School of Music.\\n\\nUpon arriving in New York, he spent most of his first weeks in town trying to get in contact with Charlie Parker, despite being advised against doing so by several people he met during his quest, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins.\\n\\nFinally locating his idol, Davis became one of the cadre of musicians who held nightly jam sessions at two of Harlem\\'s nightclubs, Minton\\'s Playhouse and Monroe\\'s. The group included many of the future leaders of the bebop revolution: young players such as Fats Navarro, Freddie Webster, and J. J. Johnson. Established musicians including Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke were also regular participants.\\n\\nDavis dropped out of Juilliard, after asking permission from his father. In his autobiography, Davis criticized the Juilliard classes for centering too much on the classical European and \"white\" repertoire. However, he also acknowledged that Juilliard helped give him a grounding in music theory that would prove valuable in later years.\\n\\nDavis began playing professionally, performing in several 52nd Street clubs with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis. In 1945, he entered a recording studio for the first time, as a member of Herbie Fields\\'s group. This was the first of many recordings to which Davis contributed in this period, mostly as a sideman. He finally got the chance to record as a leader in 1946, with an occasional group called the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway—one of the rare occasions when Davis, by then a member of the groundbreaking Charlie Parker Quintet, can be heard accompanying singers. In these early years, recording sessions where Davis was the leader were the exception rather than the rule; his next date as leader would not come until 1947.\\n\\nAround 1945, Dizzy Gillespie parted ways with Parker, and Davis was hired as Gillespie\\'s replacement in his quintet, which also featured Max Roach on drums, Al Haig (replaced later by Sir Charles Thompson and Duke Jordan) on piano, and Curley Russell (later replaced by Tommy Potter and Leonard Gaskin) on bass.\\n\\nWith Parker\\'s quintet, Davis went into the studio several times, already showing hints of the style for which he would become known. On an oft-quoted take of Parker\\'s signature song, \"Now\\'s the Time\", Davis takes a melodic solo, whose unbop-like quality anticipates the \"cool jazz\" period that would follow. The Parker quintet also toured widely. During a stop in Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that landed him in the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for several months, and Davis found himself stranded. He roomed and collaborated for some time with bassist Charles Mingus, before getting a job on Billy Eckstine\\'s California tour, which eventually brought him back to New York. In 1948, Parker returned to New York, and Davis rejoined his group.\\n\\nThe relationships within the quintet, however, were growing tense. Parker\\'s erratic behavior (attributable to his well-known drug addiction) and artistic choices (both Davis and Roach objected to having Duke Jordan as a pianist and would have preferred Bud Powell) became sources of friction. In December 1948, disputes over money (Davis claims he was not being paid) began to strain their relationship even further. Davis finally left the group following a confrontation with Parker at the Royal Roost.\\n\\nFor Davis, his departure from Parker\\'s group marked the beginning of a period in which he worked mainly as a freelancer and as a sideman in some of the most important combos on the New York jazz scene.\\n\\nIn 1948 Davis grew close to the Canadian composer and arranger Gil Evans. Evans\\' house had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers (including Davis, Roach, pianist John Lewis, and baritone sax player Gerry Mulligan) unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumentalism that dominated the bebop scene of the time. Evans had been the arranger for the Claude Thornhill orchestra, and it was the sound of this group, as well as Duke Ellington\\'s example, that suggested the creation of an unusual line-up: a nonet including a French horn and a tuba (this accounts for the \"tuba band\" moniker that was to be associated with the combo).\\n\\nDavis took an active role in the project, so much so that it soon became \"his project\". The objective was to achieve a sound similar to the human voice, through carefully arranged compositions and by emphasizing a relaxed, melodic approach to the improvisations.\\n\\nThe nonet debuted in the summer of 1948, with a two-week engagement at the Royal Roost. The sign announcing the performance gave a surprising prominence to the role of the arrangers: \"Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan\". It was, in fact, so unusual that Davis had to persuade the Roost\\'s manager, Ralph Watkins, to allow the sign to be worded in this way; he prevailed only with the help of Monte Kay, the club\\'s artistic director.\\n\\nThe nonet was active until the end of 1949, along the way undergoing several changes in personnel: Roach and Davis were constantly featured, along with Mulligan, tuba player Bill Barber, and alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, who had been preferred to Sonny Stitt (whose playing was considered too bop-oriented). Over the months, John Lewis alternated with Al Haig on piano, Mike Zwerin with Kai Winding on trombone (Johnson was touring at the time), Junior Collins with Sandy Siegelstein and Gunther Schuller on French horn, and Al McKibbon with Joe Shulman on bass. Singer Kenny Hagood was added for one track during the recording sessions.\\n\\nThe presence of white musicians in the group angered some African American jazz players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.\\n\\nA contract with Capitol Records granted the nonet several recording sessions between January 1949 and April 1950. The material they recorded was released in 1956 on an album whose title, Birth of the Cool, gave its name to the \"cool jazz\" movement that developed at the same time and partly shared the musical direction begun by Davis\\' group.\\n\\nFor his part, Davis was fully aware of the importance of the project, which he pursued to the point of turning down a job with Duke Ellington\\'s orchestra.\\n\\nThe importance of the nonet experience would become clear to critics and the larger public only in later years, but, at least commercially, the nonet was not a success. The liner notes of the first recordings of the Davis Quintet for Columbia Records call it one of the most spectacular failures of the jazz club scene. This was bitterly noted by Davis, who claimed the invention of the cool style and resented the success that was later enjoyed—in large part because of the media\\'s attention—by white \"cool jazz\" musicians (Mulligan and Dave Brubeck in particular).\\n\\nThis experience also marked the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Davis and Gil Evans, an alliance that would bear important results in the years to follow.\\n\\nThe first half of the 1950s was, for Davis, a period of great personal difficulty. At the end of 1949, he went on tour in Paris with a group including Tadd Dameron, Kenny Clarke (who remained in Europe after the tour), and James Moody. Davis was fascinated by Paris and its cultural environment, where black jazz musicians, and African Americans in general, often felt better respected than they did in their homeland. While in Paris, Davis began a relationship with French actress and singer Juliette Greco.\\n\\nMany of his new and old friends (Davis, in his autobiography, mentions Clarke) tried to persuade him to stay in France, but Davis decided to return to New York. Back in the States, he began to feel deeply depressed. The depression was due in part to his separation from Greco, in part to his feeling underappreciated by the critics (who were hailing Davis\\' former collaborators as leaders of the cool jazz movement), and in part to the unraveling of his liaison with a former St. Louis schoolmate who was living with him in New York and with whom he had two children.\\n\\nThese are the factors to which Davis traces a heroin habit that deeply affected him for the next four years. Though Davis denies it in his autobiography, it is also likely that the environment in which he was living played a role. Most of Davis\\' associates at the time, some of them perhaps in imitation of Charlie Parker, had drug addictions of their own (among them, sax players Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon, trumpeters Fats Navarro and Freddie Webster, and drummer Art Blakey). For the next four years, Davis supported his habit partly with his music and partly by living the life of a hustler. By 1953, his drug addiction was beginning to impair his ability to perform. Heroin had killed some of his friends (Navarro and Freddie Webster). He himself had been arrested for drug possession while on tour in Los Angeles, and his drug habit had been made public in a devastating interview that Cab Calloway gave to Down Beat.\\n\\nRealizing his precarious condition, Davis tried several times to end his drug addiction, finally succeeding in 1954 after returning to his father\\'s home in St. Louis for several months and literally locking himself in a room until he had gone through a painful withdrawal. During this period he avoided New York and played mostly in Detroit and other midwestern towns, where drugs were then harder to come by.\\n\\nDespite all the personal turmoil, the 1950–54 period was actually quite fruitful for Davis artistically. He made quite a number of recordings and had several collaborations with other important musicians. He got to know the music of Chicago pianist Ahmad Jamal, whose elegant approach and use of space influenced him deeply. He also definitively severed his stylistic ties with bebop.\\n\\nIn 1951, Davis met Bob Weinstock, the owner of Prestige Records, and signed a contract with the label. Between 1951 and 1954, he released many records on Prestige, with several different combos. While the personnel of the recordings varied, the lineup often featured Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey. Davis was particularly fond of Rollins and tried several times, in the years that preceded his meeting with John Coltrane, to recruit him for a regular group. He never succeeded, however, mostly because Rollins was prone to make himself unavailable for months at a time. In spite of the casual occasions that generated these recordings, their quality is almost always quite high, and they document the evolution of Davis\\' style and sound. During this time he began using the Harmon mute, held close to the microphone, in a way that grew to be his signature, and his phrasing, especially in ballads, became spacious, melodic, and relaxed. This sound was to become so characteristic that the use of the Harmon mute by any jazz trumpet player since immediately conjures up Miles Davis.\\n\\nThe most important Prestige recordings of this period (Dig, Blue Haze, Bags\\' Groove, Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, and Walkin\\') originated mostly from recording sessions in 1951 and 1954, after Davis\\' recovery from his addiction. Also of importance are his five Blue Note recordings, collected in the Miles Davis, Volume 1 album.\\n\\nWith these recordings, Davis assumed a central position in what is known as hard bop. In contrast with bebop, hard bop used slower tempos and a less radical approach to harmony and melody, often adopting popular tunes and standards from the American songbook as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop also distanced itself from cool jazz by virtue of a harder beat and by its constant reference to the blues, both in its traditional form and in the form made popular by rhythm and blues. A few critics go as far as to call Walkin\\' the album that created hard bop, but the point is debatable, given the number of musicians who were working along similar lines at the same time (and of course many of them recorded or played with Davis).\\n\\nAlso in this period Davis gained a reputation for being distant, cold, and withdrawn and for having a quick temper. Among the several factors that contributed to this reputation were his contempt for the critics and specialized press and some well-publicized confrontations with the public and with fellow musicians. (One occasion, in which he had a near fight with Thelonious Monk during the recording of Bags\\' Groove, received wide exposure in the specialized press.)\\n\\nThe \"nocturnal\" quality of Davis\\' playing and his somber reputation, along with his whispering voice, earned him the lasting moniker of \"prince of darkness\", adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.\\n\\nBack in New York and in better health, in 1955 Davis attended the Newport Jazz Festival, where his performance (and especially his solo on \"\\'Round Midnight\") was greatly admired and prompted the critics to hail the \"return of Miles Davis\". At the same time, Davis recruited the players for a formation that became known as his \"first great quintet\": John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.\\n\\nNone of these musicians, with the exception of Davis, had received a great deal of exposure before that time; Chambers, in particular, was very young (19 at the time), a Detroit player who had been on the New York scene for only about a year, working with the bands of Bennie Green, Paul Quinichette, George Wallington, J. J. Johnson, and Kai Winding. Coltrane was little known at the time, in spite of earlier collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges. Davis hired Coltrane as a replacement for Sonny Rollins, after unsuccessfully trying to recruit Cannonball Adderley.\\n\\nThe repertoire included many bebop mainstays, standards from the Great American Songbook and the pre-bop era, and some traditional tunes. The prevailing style of the group was a development of the Davis experience in the previous years—Davis playing long, legato, and essentially melodic lines, while Coltrane, who during these years emerged as a leading figure on the musical scene, contrasted by playing high-energy solos.\\n\\nWith the new formation also came a new recording contract. In Newport, Davis had met Columbia Records producer George Avakian, who persuaded him to sign with his label. The quintet made its debut on record with the extremely well received \\'Round About Midnight. Before leaving Prestige, however, Davis had to fulfill his obligations during two days of recording sessions in 1956. Prestige released these recordings in the following years as four albums: Relaxin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Steamin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Workin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet, and Cookin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet. While the recording took place in a studio, each record of this series has the structure and feel of a live performance, with several first takes on each album. The records became almost instant classics and were instrumental in establishing Davis\\' quintet as one of the best on the jazz scene.\\n\\nThe quintet was disbanded for the first time in 1957, following a series of personal problems that Davis blames on the drug addiction of the other musicians. Davis played some gigs at the Cafe Bohemia with a short-lived formation that included Sonny Rollins and drummer Art Taylor, and then traveled to France, where he recorded the score to Louis Malle\\'s film Ascenseur pour l\\'échafaud. With the aid of French session musicians Barney Wilen, Pierre Michelot, and René Urtreger, and American drummer Kenny Clarke, he recorded the entire soundtrack with an innovative procedure, without relying on written material: starting from sparse indication of the harmony and a general feel of a given piece, the group played by watching the movie on a screen in front of them and improvising.\\n\\nReturning to New York in 1958, Davis recruited alto saxophonist Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley. Coltrane, who in the meantime had freed himself from his drug habits, was available after a highly fruitful experience with Thelonious Monk and was hired back, as was Philly Joe Jones. With the quintet re-formed as a sextet, Davis recorded Milestones, an album anticipating the new directions he was preparing to give to his music.\\n\\nAlmost immediately after the recording of Milestones, Davis fired Garland and, shortly afterward, Jones, again for behavioral problems; he replaced them with Bill Evans—a young white pianist with a strong classical background—and drummer Jimmy Cobb. With this revamped formation, Davis began a year during which the sextet performed and toured extensively and produced a record (1958 Miles, also known as 58 Sessions). Evans had a unique, impressionistic approach to the piano, and his musical ideas had a strong influence on Davis. But after only eight months on the road with the group, he was burned out and left. He was soon replaced by Wynton Kelly, a player who brought to the sextet a swinging, bluesy approach that contrasted with Evans\\' more delicate playing.\\n\\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with Gil Evans, often playing flugelhorn as well as trumpet. The first, Miles Ahead (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz big band and a horn section arranged by Evans. Songs included Dave Brubeck\\'s \"The Duke,\" as well as Léo Delibes\\'s \"The Maids of Cadiz,\" the first piece of European classical music Davis had recorded. Another distinctive feature of the album was the orchestral passages that Evans had devised as transitions between the different tracks, which were joined together with the innovative use of editing in the post-production phase, turning each side of the album into a seamless piece of music.\\n\\nIn 1958, Davis and Evans were back in the studio to record Porgy and Bess, an arrangement of pieces from George Gershwin\\'s opera of the same name. The lineup included three members of the sextet: Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones, and Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley. Davis called the album one of his favorites.\\n\\nSketches of Spain (1959–1960) featured songs by contemporary Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo and also Manuel de Falla, as well as Gil Evans originals with a Spanish flavor. Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall (1961) includes Rodrigo\\'s Concierto de Aranjuez, along with other compositions recorded in concert with an orchestra under Evans\\' direction.\\n\\nSessions with Davis and Evans in 1962 resulted in the album Quiet Nights, a short collection of bossa novas that was released against the wishes of both artists: Evans stated it was only half an album, and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer Teo Macero, whom he didn\\'t speak to for more than two years. This was the last time Evans and Davis made a full album together; despite the professional separation, however, Davis noted later that \"my best friend is Gil Evans.\"\\n\\nIn March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet to record what is widely considered his magnum opus, Kind of Blue. He called back Bill Evans, months away from forming what would become his own seminal trio, for the album sessions, as the music had been planned around Evans\\' piano style. Both Davis and Evans were personally acquainted with the ideas of pianist George Russell regarding modal jazz, Davis from discussions with Russell and others before the Birth of the Cool sessions, and Evans from study with Russell in 1956. Davis, however, had neglected to inform current pianist Kelly of Evans\\' role in the recordings; Kelly subsequently played only on the track \"Freddie Freeloader\" and was not present at the April dates for the album. \"So What\" and \"All Blues\" had been played by the sextet at performances prior to the recording sessions, but for the other three compositions, Davis and Evans prepared skeletal harmonic frameworks that the other musicians saw for the first time on the day of recording, to allow a fresher approach to their improvisations. The resulting album has proven to be both highly popular and enormously influential. According to the RIAA, Kind of Blue is the best-selling jazz album of all time, having been certified as quadruple platinum (4 million copies sold). In December 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution honoring the album as a national treasure.\\n\\nThe trumpet Davis used on the recording is currently displayed in the music building on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was donated to the school by Arthur \"Buddy\" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the \"Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program.\"\\n\\nLater in 1959, while taking a break outside the famous Birdland nightclub in New York City, Davis along with others were told by a police officer to clear the side walk and subsequently didn\\'t. The officer said that he would arrest Miles and reached for his cuffs when Miles leaned toward him (boxing style), the police officer fell backward with his cuffs falling. Seconds later a detective came up behind Miles and hit him on the head with a baton resulting in blood getting on his suit. Miles was then arrested, where in the station police harassed him by bumping into him on purpose. Davis attempted to pursue the case in the courts, before eventually dropping the proceedings in a plea bargain in order to recover his suspended Cabaret Card, enabling him to return to work in New York clubs.\\n\\nDavis persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on Davis\\' 1961 album Someday My Prince Will Come. After Coltrane, Davis tried various saxophonists, including Jimmy Heath, Sonny Stitt, and Hank Mobley. The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at Carnegie Hall and the Black Hawk jazz club in San Francisco. Stitt\\'s playing with the group is found on a recording made in Olympia, Paris (where Davis and Coltrane had played a few months before) and the Live in Stockholm album.\\n\\nIn 1963, Davis\\' longtime rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb departed. He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including tenor saxophonist George Coleman and bassist Ron Carter. Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half the tracks for an album in the spring of 1963. A few weeks later, seventeen-year-old drummer Tony Williams and pianist Herbie Hancock joined the group, and soon afterward Davis, Coleman, and the new rhythm section recorded the rest of Seven Steps to Heaven.\\n\\nThe rhythm players melded together quickly as a section and with the horns. The group\\'s rapid evolution can be traced through the Seven Steps to Heaven album, In Europe (July 1963), My Funny Valentine (February 1964), and Four and More (also February 1964). The quintet played essentially the same repertoire of bebop tunes and standards that earlier Davis bands had played, but they tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and, in the case of the up-tempo material, breakneck speed.\\n\\nColeman left in the spring of 1964, to be replaced by avant-garde saxophonist Sam Rivers, on the suggestion of Tony Williams. Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in Japan; this configuration can be heard on Miles in Tokyo! (July 1964).\\n\\nBy the end of the summer, Davis had persuaded Wayne Shorter to leave Art Blakey\\'s Jazz Messengers and join the quintet. Shorter became the group\\'s principal composer, and some of his compositions of this era (including \"Footprints\" and \"Nefertiti\") have become standards. While on tour in Europe, the group quickly made their first official recording, Miles in Berlin (September 1964). On returning to the United States later that year, ever the musical entrepreneur, Davis (at Jackie DeShannon\\'s urging) was instrumental in getting The Byrds signed to Columbia Records.\\n\\nBy the time of E.S.P. (1965), Davis\\' lineup consisted of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter (bass), and Tony Williams (drums). The last of his acoustic bands, this group is often referred to as \"the second great quintet.\"\\n\\nA two-night Chicago performance in late 1965 is captured on The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965, released in 1995. Unlike their studio albums, the live engagement shows the group still playing primarily standards and bebop tunes. It is reasonable to point out though, that whilst some of the titles remain the same as the tunes employed by the 1950s quintet, the speed and distance of departure from the framework of the standards bears no comparison. It could even be said that the listening experience to these standards as live performances is as much of a radical take on the jazz of the time as the new compositions of the studio albums listed below.\\n\\nThe recording of Live at the Plugged Nickel was not issued anywhere in the 1960s, first appearing as a Japan-only partial issue in the late 1970s, then as a double-LP in the USA and Europe in 1982. It was followed by a series of studio recordings: Miles Smiles (1966), Sorcerer (1967), Nefertiti (1967), Miles in the Sky (1968), and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1968). The quintet\\'s approach to improvisation came to be known as \"time no changes\" or \"freebop,\" because they abandoned the more conventional chord-change-based approach of bebop for a modal approach. Through Nefertiti, the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their live concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation. Davis\\'s bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975.\\n\\nMiles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro, on which electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar were tentatively introduced on some tracks, pointed the way to the subsequent fusion phase of Davis\\' career. Davis also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of Filles de Kilimanjaro had been recorded, bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea had replaced Carter and Hancock in the working band, though both Carter and Hancock would occasionally contribute to future recording sessions. Davis soon began to take over the compositional duties of his sidemen.\\n\\nDavis\\' influences included late-1960s acid rock and funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix, many of whom he met through Betty Mabry (later Betty Davis), a young model and songwriter Davis married in September 1968 and divorced a year later. The musical transition required that Davis and his band adapt to electric instruments in both live performances and the studio.\\n\\nBy the time In a Silent Way had been recorded in February 1969, Davis had augmented his quintet with additional players. At various times Hancock or Joe Zawinul was brought in to join Corea on electric keyboards, and guitarist John McLaughlin made the first of his many appearances with Davis. By this point, Shorter was also doubling on soprano saxophone. After recording this album, Williams left to form his group Lifetime and was replaced by Jack DeJohnette.\\n\\nSix months later an even larger group of musicians, including Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and Bennie Maupin, recorded the double LP Bitches Brew, which became a huge seller, reaching gold status by 1976. This album and In a Silent Way were among the first fusions of jazz and rock that were commercially successful, building on the groundwork laid by Charles Lloyd, Larry Coryell, and others who pioneered a genre that would become known as \"jazz-rock fusion\".\\n\\nDuring this period, Davis toured with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette. The group\\'s repertoire included material from Bitches Brew, In a Silent Way, and the 1960s quintet albums, along with an occasional standard.\\n\\nIn 1972, Davis was introduced to the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen by Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote that \"the effect of Davis\\' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. . . . Davis\\' own \\'space music\\' shows Stockhausen\\'s influence compositionally.\" His recordings and performances during this period were described as \"space music\" by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster, who described it as \"a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music.\"\\n\\nBoth Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way feature \"extended\" (more than 20 minutes each) compositions that were never actually \"played straight through\" by the musicians in the studio. Instead, Davis and producer Teo Macero selected musical motifs of various lengths from recorded extended improvisations and edited them together into a musical whole that exists only in the recorded version. Bitches Brew made use of such electronic effects as multi-tracking, tape loops, and other editing techniques. Both records, especially Bitches Brew, proved to be big sellers.\\n\\nStarting with Bitches Brew, Davis\\' albums began to often feature cover art much more in line with psychedelic art or black power movements than that of his earlier albums. He took significant cuts in his usual performing fees in order to open for rock groups like the Steve Miller Band, the Grateful Dead, and Santana. Several live albums were recorded during the early 1970s at these performances: Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970) - It\\'s About That Time, Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West, and Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East.\\n\\nBy the time of Live-Evil in December 1970, Davis\\' ensemble had transformed into a much more funk-oriented group. Davis began experimenting with wah-wah effects on his horn. The ensemble with Gary Bartz, Keith Jarrett, and Michael Henderson, often referred to as the \"Cellar Door band\" (the live portions of Live-Evil were recorded at a Washington, DC, club by that name), never recorded in the studio, but is documented in the six-CD box set The Cellar Door Sessions 1970, which was recorded over four nights in December 1970.\\n\\nIn 1970, Davis contributed extensively to the soundtrack of a documentary about the African-American boxer heavyweight champion Jack Johnson. Himself a devotee of boxing, Davis drew parallels between Johnson, whose career had been defined by the fruitless search for a Great White Hope to dethrone him, and Davis\\' own career, in which he felt the musical establishment of the time had prevented him from receiving the acclaim and rewards that were due him. The resulting album, 1971\\'s A Tribute to Jack Johnson, contained two long pieces that featured musicians (some of whom were not credited on the record) including guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, Herbie Hancock on a Farfisa organ, and drummer Billy Cobham. McLaughlin and Cobham went on to become founding members of the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1971.\\n\\nAs Davis stated in his autobiography, he wanted to make music for the young African-American audience. On the Corner (1972) blended funk elements with the traditional jazz styles he had played his entire career. The album was highlighted by the appearance of saxophonist Carlos Garnett. Critics were not kind to the album; in his autobiography, Davis stated that critics could not figure out how to categorize it, and he complained that the album was not promoted by the \"traditional\" jazz radio stations.\\n\\nAfter recording On the Corner, Davis put together a new group, with only Michael Henderson, Carlos Garnett, and percussionist Mtume returning from the previous band. It included guitarist Reggie Lucas, tabla player Badal Roy, sitarist Khalil Balakrishna, and drummer Al Foster. It was unusual in that none of the sidemen were major jazz instrumentalists; as a result, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of individual solos. This group, which recorded in the Philharmonic Hall for the album In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall (1972), was unsatisfactory to Davis. Through the first half of 1973, he dropped the tabla and sitar, took over keyboard duties, and added guitarist Pete Cosey. The Davis/Cosey/Lucas/Henderson/Mtume/Foster ensemble would remain virtually intact over the next two years. Initially, Dave Liebman played saxophones and flute with the band; in 1974, he was replaced by Sonny Fortune.\\n\\nBig Fun (1974) was a double album containing four long improvisations, recorded between 1969 and 1972. Similarly, Get Up With It (1974) collected recordings from the previous five years. Get Up With It included \"He Loved Him Madly\", a tribute to Duke Ellington, as well as one of Davis\\' most lauded pieces from this era, \"Calypso Frelimo\". It was his last studio album of the 1970s.\\n\\nIn 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: Dark Magus, Agharta, and Pangaea. Dark Magus captures a 1974 New York concert; the latter two are recordings of consecutive concerts from the same February 1975 day in Osaka. At the time, only Agharta was available in the US; Pangaea and Dark Magus were initially released only by CBS/Sony Japan. All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of Hendrix-inspired electronic distortion devices; Dominique Gaumont is a third guitarist on Dark Magus), electric bass, drums, reeds, and Davis on electric trumpet and organ. These albums were the last he was to record for five years. Davis was troubled by osteoarthritis (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, ulcers, and a renewed dependence on alcohol and drugs (primarily cocaine), and his performances were routinely panned by critics throughout late 1974 and early 1975. By the time the group reached Japan in February 1975, Davis was nearing a physical breakdown and required copious amounts of alcohol and narcotics to make it through his engagements. Nonetheless, as noted by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, during these concerts his trumpet playing \"is of the highest and most adventurous order.\"\\n\\nAfter a Newport Jazz Festival performance at Avery Fisher Hall in New York on July 1, 1975, Davis withdrew almost completely from the public eye for six years. As Gil Evans said, \"His organism is tired. And after all the music he\\'s contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest.\"\\n\\nDavis characterized this period in his memoirs as a colorful time when wealthy women lavished him with sex and drugs. In reality, he had become completely dependent on various drugs, spending nearly all of his time propped up on a couch in his apartment watching television, leaving only to find more drugs. In 1976, Rolling Stone reported rumors of his imminent demise. Although he stopped practicing trumpet on a regular basis, Davis continued to compose intermittently and made three attempts at recording during his exile from performing; these sessions (one with the assistance of Paul Buckmaster and Gil Evans, who left after not receiving promised compensation) bore little fruit and remain unreleased.\\n\\nIn 1979, he placed in the yearly top-ten trumpeter poll of Down Beat. Columbia continued to issue compilation albums and records of unreleased vault material to fulfill contractual obligations.\\n\\nDuring his period of inactivity, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade enter into the mainstream. When he emerged from retirement, Davis\\' musical descendants would be in the realm of New Wave rock, and in particular the styling of Prince.\\n\\nBy 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress Cicely Tyson. With Tyson, Davis would overcome his cocaine addiction and regain his enthusiasm for music. As he had not played trumpet for the better part of three years, regaining his famed embouchure proved to be particularly arduous. While recording The Man with the Horn (sessions were spread sporadically over 1979–1981), Davis played mostly wahwah with a younger, larger band.\\n\\nThe initial large band was eventually abandoned in favor of a smaller combo featuring saxophonist Bill Evans and bass player Marcus Miller, both of whom would be among Davis\\' most regular collaborators throughout the decade. He married Tyson in 1981; they would divorce in 1988. The Man with the Horn was finally released in 1981 and received a poor critical reception despite selling fairly well. In May, the new band played two dates as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. The concerts, as well as the live recording We Want Miles from the ensuing tour, received positive reviews.\\n\\nBy late 1982, Davis\\' band included French percussionist Mino Cinelu and guitarist John Scofield, with whom he worked closely on the album Star People. In mid-1983, while working on the tracks for Decoy, an album mixing soul music and electronica that was released in 1984, Davis brought in producer, composer and keyboardist Robert Irving III, who had earlier collaborated with him on The Man with the Horn. With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, keyboardist and music director Irving, drummer Al Foster and bassist Darryl Jones (later of The Rolling Stones), Davis played a series of European gigs to positive receptions. While in Europe, he took part in the recording of Aura, an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. You\\'re Under Arrest, Davis\\' next album, was released in 1985 and included another brief stylistic detour. Included on the album were his interpretations of Cyndi Lauper\\'s ballad \"Time After Time,\" and \"Human Nature\" from Michael Jackson. Davis considered releasing an entire album of pop songs and recorded dozens of them, but the idea was scrapped. Davis noted that many of today\\'s accepted jazz standards were in fact pop songs from Broadway theater, and that he was simply updating the \"standards\" repertoire with new material.\\n\\nYou\\'re Under Arrest also proved to be Davis\\' final album for Columbia. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis publicly dismissed Davis\\' more recent fusion recordings as not being \"\\'true\\' jazz\", comments Davis initially shrugged off, calling Marsalis \"a nice young man, only confused\". This changed after Marsalis appeared, unannounced, onstage in the midst of a Davis performance. Marsalis whispered into Davis\\' ear that \"someone\" had told him to do so; Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.\\n\\nDavis grew irritated at Columbia\\'s delay releasing Aura. The breaking point in the label-artist relationship appears to have come when a Columbia jazz producer requested Davis place a goodwill birthday call to Marsalis. Davis signed with Warner Brothers shortly thereafter.\\n\\nDavis collaborated with a number of figures from the British new wave movement during this period, including Scritti Politti. At the invitation of producer Bill Laswell, Davis recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd\\'s Album, according to Public Image\\'s John Lydon in the liner notes of their Plastic Box box set. In Lydon\\'s words, however, \"strangely enough, we didn\\'t use (his contributions).\" (Also according to Lydon in the Plastic Box notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon\\'s singing voice to his trumpet sound.)\\n\\nHaving first taken part in the Artists United Against Apartheid recording, Davis signed with Warner Brothers records and reunited with Marcus Miller. The resulting record, Tutu (1986), would be his first to use modern studio tools — programmed synthesizers, samples and drum loops — to create an entirely new setting for Davis\\' playing. Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as the modern counterpart of Sketches of Spain and won a Grammy in 1987.\\n\\nHe followed Tutu with Amandla, another collaboration with Miller and George Duke, plus the soundtracks to four movies: Street Smart, Siesta, The Hot Spot, and Dingo. He continued to tour with a band of constantly rotating personnel and a critical stock at a level higher than it had been for 15 years. His last recordings, both released posthumously, were the hip hop-influenced studio album Doo-Bop and Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux, a collaboration with Quincy Jones for the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival in which Davis performed the repertoire from his 1940s and 1950s recordings for the first time in decades.\\n\\nIn 1988 he had a small part as a street musician in the film Scrooged, starring Bill Murray. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In 1989, Miles was interviewed on the television show \\'60 minutes\\' by Harry Reasoner.\\n\\nIn early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film Dingo as a jazz musician. In the film\\'s opening sequence, Davis and his band unexpectedly land on a remote airstrip in the Australian outback and proceed to perform for the stunned locals. The performance was one of Davis\\' last on film.\\n\\nMiles Davis died on September 28, 1991 from a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure in Santa Monica, California at the age of 65. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.\\n\\nMiles Davis is regarded as one of the most innovative, influential and respected figures in the history of jazz music. He has been described as “one of the great innovators in jazz”. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll noted \"Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-\\'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style - in attitude and fashion - as well as music\". His album Kind of Blue is the best-selling album in the history of jazz music and was praised by the United States House of Representatives to \"pass a symbolic resolution honoring the masterpiece and reaffirming jazz as a national treasure.\"\\n\\nAs an innovative bandleader and composer, Miles Davis has influenced many notable musicians and bands from diverse genres. These include Wayne Shorter, Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Hancock, Lalo Schifrin, Tangerine Dream, Brand X, Mtume, Benny Bailey, Joe Bonner, Don Cherry, Urszula Dudziak, Bill Evans, Bill Hardman, The Lounge Lizards, Hugh Masekela , John McLaughlin, King Crimson, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa, Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, Lydia Lunch, Talk Talk, Michael Franks, Sting, Lonnie Liston Smith, Jiří Stivín, Tim Hagans, Julie Christensen, Vassar Clements, Snooky Young, Prince and Christian Scott.\\n\\nMiles\\' influence on the people who played with him has been described by music writer and author Christopher Smith as follows:\\n\\nMiles Davis\\' artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary. [...] Miles\\' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.\\n\\nHis approach, owing largely to the African American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.\\n\\nIn 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Miles Davis an Honorary Doctorate for his extraordinary contributions to music. Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) has honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Many well-known musicians rose to prominence as members of Davis\\' ensembles, including saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, George Coleman, Wayne Shorter, Dave Liebman, Branford Marsalis and Kenny Garrett; trombonist J. J. Johnson; pianists Horace Silver, Red Garland, Wynton Kelly, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Keith Jarrett; guitarists John McLaughlin, John Scofield and Mike Stern; bassists Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, Marcus Miller and Darryl Jones, ; and drummers Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, Jack DeJohnette, and Al Foster.\\n\\nMiles Davis was born on May 26, 1926, to a relatively affluent family in Alton, Illinois. His father, Dr. Miles Henry Davis, was a dentist. In 1927 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They also owned a substantial ranch in northern Arkansas, where Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.\\n\\nDavis\\' mother, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but kept this fact hidden from her son. His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan. Davis later suggested that his father\\'s instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet\\'s sound. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato; he was reported to have slapped Davis\\' knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato. Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, \"I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything.\" Clark Terry was another important early influence.\\n\\nBy age 16, Davis was a member of the music society and playing professionally when not at school. At 17, he spent a year playing in Eddie Randle\\'s band, the Blue Devils. During this time, Sonny Stitt tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, then passing through town, but Davis\\' mother insisted that he finish his final year of high school.\\n\\nIn 1944, the Billy Eckstine band visited East St. Louis. Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were members of the band, and Davis was brought in on third trumpet for a couple of weeks because the regular player, Buddy Anderson, was out sick. Even after this experience, once Eckstine\\'s band left town, Davis\\' parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies.\\n\\nIn the fall of 1944, following graduation from high school, Davis moved to New York City to study at the Juilliard School of Music.\\n\\nUpon arriving in New York, he spent most of his first weeks in town trying to get in contact with Charlie Parker, despite being advised against doing so by several people he met during his quest, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins.\\n\\nFinally locating his idol, Davis became one of the cadre of musicians who held nightly jam sessions at two of Harlem\\'s nightclubs, Minton\\'s Playhouse and Monroe\\'s. The group included many of the future leaders of the bebop revolution: young players such as Fats Navarro, Freddie Webster, and J. J. Johnson. Established musicians including Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke were also regular participants.\\n\\nDavis dropped out of Juilliard, after asking permission from his father. In his autobiography, Davis criticized the Juilliard classes for centering too much on the classical European and \"white\" repertoire. However, he also acknowledged that Juilliard helped give him a grounding in music theory that would prove valuable in later years.\\n\\nDavis began playing professionally, performing in several 52nd Street clubs with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis. In 1945, he entered a recording studio for the first time, as a member of Herbie Fields\\'s group. This was the first of many recordings to which Davis contributed in this period, mostly as a sideman. He finally got the chance to record as a leader in 1946, with an occasional group called the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway—one of the rare occasions when Davis, by then a member of the groundbreaking Charlie Parker Quintet, can be heard accompanying singers. In these early years, recording sessions where Davis was the leader were the exception rather than the rule; his next date as leader would not come until 1947.\\n\\nAround 1945, Dizzy Gillespie parted ways with Parker, and Davis was hired as Gillespie\\'s replacement in his quintet, which also featured Max Roach on drums, Al Haig (replaced later by Sir Charles Thompson and Duke Jordan) on piano, and Curley Russell (later replaced by Tommy Potter and Leonard Gaskin) on bass.\\n\\nWith Parker\\'s quintet, Davis went into the studio several times, already showing hints of the style for which he would become known. On an oft-quoted take of Parker\\'s signature song, \"Now\\'s the Time\", Davis takes a melodic solo, whose unbop-like quality anticipates the \"cool jazz\" period that would follow. The Parker quintet also toured widely. During a stop in Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that landed him in the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for several months, and Davis found himself stranded. He roomed and collaborated for some time with bassist Charles Mingus, before getting a job on Billy Eckstine\\'s California tour, which eventually brought him back to New York. In 1948, Parker returned to New York, and Davis rejoined his group.\\n\\nThe relationships within the quintet, however, were growing tense. Parker\\'s erratic behavior (attributable to his well-known drug addiction) and artistic choices (both Davis and Roach objected to having Duke Jordan as a pianist and would have preferred Bud Powell) became sources of friction. In December 1948, disputes over money (Davis claims he was not being paid) began to strain their relationship even further. Davis finally left the group following a confrontation with Parker at the Royal Roost.\\n\\nFor Davis, his departure from Parker\\'s group marked the beginning of a period in which he worked mainly as a freelancer and as a sideman in some of the most important combos on the New York jazz scene.\\n\\nIn 1948 Davis grew close to the Canadian composer and arranger Gil Evans. Evans\\' house had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers (including Davis, Roach, pianist John Lewis, and baritone sax player Gerry Mulligan) unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumentalism that dominated the bebop scene of the time. Evans had been the arranger for the Claude Thornhill orchestra, and it was the sound of this group, as well as Duke Ellington\\'s example, that suggested the creation of an unusual line-up: a nonet including a French horn and a tuba (this accounts for the \"tuba band\" moniker that was to be associated with the combo).\\n\\nDavis took an active role in the project, so much so that it soon became \"his project\". The objective was to achieve a sound similar to the human voice, through carefully arranged compositions and by emphasizing a relaxed, melodic approach to the improvisations.\\n\\nThe nonet debuted in the summer of 1948, with a two-week engagement at the Royal Roost. The sign announcing the performance gave a surprising prominence to the role of the arrangers: \"Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan\". It was, in fact, so unusual that Davis had to persuade the Roost\\'s manager, Ralph Watkins, to allow the sign to be worded in this way; he prevailed only with the help of Monte Kay, the club\\'s artistic director.\\n\\nThe nonet was active until the end of 1949, along the way undergoing several changes in personnel: Roach and Davis were constantly featured, along with Mulligan, tuba player Bill Barber, and alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, who had been preferred to Sonny Stitt (whose playing was considered too bop-oriented). Over the months, John Lewis alternated with Al Haig on piano, Mike Zwerin with Kai Winding on trombone (Johnson was touring at the time), Junior Collins with Sandy Siegelstein and Gunther Schuller on French horn, and Al McKibbon with Joe Shulman on bass. Singer Kenny Hagood was added for one track during the recording sessions.\\n\\nThe presence of white musicians in the group angered some African American jazz players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.\\n\\nA contract with Capitol Records granted the nonet several recording sessions between January 1949 and April 1950. The material they recorded was released in 1956 on an album whose title, Birth of the Cool, gave its name to the \"cool jazz\" movement that developed at the same time and partly shared the musical direction begun by Davis\\' group.\\n\\nFor his part, Davis was fully aware of the importance of the project, which he pursued to the point of turning down a job with Duke Ellington\\'s orchestra.\\n\\nThe importance of the nonet experience would become clear to critics and the larger public only in later years, but, at least commercially, the nonet was not a success. The liner notes of the first recordings of the Davis Quintet for Columbia Records call it one of the most spectacular failures of the jazz club scene. This was bitterly noted by Davis, who claimed the invention of the cool style and resented the success that was later enjoyed—in large part because of the media\\'s attention—by white \"cool jazz\" musicians (Mulligan and Dave Brubeck in particular).\\n\\nThis experience also marked the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Davis and Gil Evans, an alliance that would bear important results in the years to follow.\\n\\nThe first half of the 1950s was, for Davis, a period of great personal difficulty. At the end of 1949, he went on tour in Paris with a group including Tadd Dameron, Kenny Clarke (who remained in Europe after the tour), and James Moody. Davis was fascinated by Paris and its cultural environment, where black jazz musicians, and African Americans in general, often felt better respected than they did in their homeland. While in Paris, Davis began a relationship with French actress and singer Juliette Greco.\\n\\nMany of his new and old friends (Davis, in his autobiography, mentions Clarke) tried to persuade him to stay in France, but Davis decided to return to New York. Back in the States, he began to feel deeply depressed. The depression was due in part to his separation from Greco, in part to his feeling underappreciated by the critics (who were hailing Davis\\' former collaborators as leaders of the cool jazz movement), and in part to the unraveling of his liaison with a former St. Louis schoolmate who was living with him in New York and with whom he had two children.\\n\\nThese are the factors to which Davis traces a heroin habit that deeply affected him for the next four years. Though Davis denies it in his autobiography, it is also likely that the environment in which he was living played a role. Most of Davis\\' associates at the time, some of them perhaps in imitation of Charlie Parker, had drug addictions of their own (among them, sax players Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon, trumpeters Fats Navarro and Freddie Webster, and drummer Art Blakey). For the next four years, Davis supported his habit partly with his music and partly by living the life of a hustler. By 1953, his drug addiction was beginning to impair his ability to perform. Heroin had killed some of his friends (Navarro and Freddie Webster). He himself had been arrested for drug possession while on tour in Los Angeles, and his drug habit had been made public in a devastating interview that Cab Calloway gave to Down Beat.\\n\\nRealizing his precarious condition, Davis tried several times to end his drug addiction, finally succeeding in 1954 after returning to his father\\'s home in St. Louis for several months and literally locking himself in a room until he had gone through a painful withdrawal. During this period he avoided New York and played mostly in Detroit and other midwestern towns, where drugs were then harder to come by.\\n\\nDespite all the personal turmoil, the 1950–54 period was actually quite fruitful for Davis artistically. He made quite a number of recordings and had several collaborations with other important musicians. He got to know the music of Chicago pianist Ahmad Jamal, whose elegant approach and use of space influenced him deeply. He also definitively severed his stylistic ties with bebop.\\n\\nIn 1951, Davis met Bob Weinstock, the owner of Prestige Records, and signed a contract with the label. Between 1951 and 1954, he released many records on Prestige, with several different combos. While the personnel of the recordings varied, the lineup often featured Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey. Davis was particularly fond of Rollins and tried several times, in the years that preceded his meeting with John Coltrane, to recruit him for a regular group. He never succeeded, however, mostly because Rollins was prone to make himself unavailable for months at a time. In spite of the casual occasions that generated these recordings, their quality is almost always quite high, and they document the evolution of Davis\\' style and sound. During this time he began using the Harmon mute, held close to the microphone, in a way that grew to be his signature, and his phrasing, especially in ballads, became spacious, melodic, and relaxed. This sound was to become so characteristic that the use of the Harmon mute by any jazz trumpet player since immediately conjures up Miles Davis.\\n\\nThe most important Prestige recordings of this period (Dig, Blue Haze, Bags\\' Groove, Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, and Walkin\\') originated mostly from recording sessions in 1951 and 1954, after Davis\\' recovery from his addiction. Also of importance are his five Blue Note recordings, collected in the Miles Davis, Volume 1 album.\\n\\nWith these recordings, Davis assumed a central position in what is known as hard bop. In contrast with bebop, hard bop used slower tempos and a less radical approach to harmony and melody, often adopting popular tunes and standards from the American songbook as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop also distanced itself from cool jazz by virtue of a harder beat and by its constant reference to the blues, both in its traditional form and in the form made popular by rhythm and blues. A few critics go as far as to call Walkin\\' the album that created hard bop, but the point is debatable, given the number of musicians who were working along similar lines at the same time (and of course many of them recorded or played with Davis).\\n\\nAlso in this period Davis gained a reputation for being distant, cold, and withdrawn and for having a quick temper. Among the several factors that contributed to this reputation were his contempt for the critics and specialized press and some well-publicized confrontations with the public and with fellow musicians. (One occasion, in which he had a near fight with Thelonious Monk during the recording of Bags\\' Groove, received wide exposure in the specialized press.)\\n\\nThe \"nocturnal\" quality of Davis\\' playing and his somber reputation, along with his whispering voice, earned him the lasting moniker of \"prince of darkness\", adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.\\n\\nBack in New York and in better health, in 1955 Davis attended the Newport Jazz Festival, where his performance (and especially his solo on \"\\'Round Midnight\") was greatly admired and prompted the critics to hail the \"return of Miles Davis\". At the same time, Davis recruited the players for a formation that became known as his \"first great quintet\": John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.\\n\\nNone of these musicians, with the exception of Davis, had received a great deal of exposure before that time; Chambers, in particular, was very young (19 at the time), a Detroit player who had been on the New York scene for only about a year, working with the bands of Bennie Green, Paul Quinichette, George Wallington, J. J. Johnson, and Kai Winding. Coltrane was little known at the time, in spite of earlier collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges. Davis hired Coltrane as a replacement for Sonny Rollins, after unsuccessfully trying to recruit Cannonball Adderley.\\n\\nThe repertoire included many bebop mainstays, standards from the Great American Songbook and the pre-bop era, and some traditional tunes. The prevailing style of the group was a development of the Davis experience in the previous years—Davis playing long, legato, and essentially melodic lines, while Coltrane, who during these years emerged as a leading figure on the musical scene, contrasted by playing high-energy solos.\\n\\nWith the new formation also came a new recording contract. In Newport, Davis had met Columbia Records producer George Avakian, who persuaded him to sign with his label. The quintet made its debut on record with the extremely well received \\'Round About Midnight. Before leaving Prestige, however, Davis had to fulfill his obligations during two days of recording sessions in 1956. Prestige released these recordings in the following years as four albums: Relaxin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Steamin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Workin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet, and Cookin\\' with the Miles Davis Quintet. While the recording took place in a studio, each record of this series has the structure and feel of a live performance, with several first takes on each album. The records became almost instant classics and were instrumental in establishing Davis\\' quintet as one of the best on the jazz scene.\\n\\nThe quintet was disbanded for the first time in 1957, following a series of personal problems that Davis blames on the drug addiction of the other musicians. Davis played some gigs at the Cafe Bohemia with a short-lived formation that included Sonny Rollins and drummer Art Taylor, and then traveled to France, where he recorded the score to Louis Malle\\'s film Ascenseur pour l\\'échafaud. With the aid of French session musicians Barney Wilen, Pierre Michelot, and René Urtreger, and American drummer Kenny Clarke, he recorded the entire soundtrack with an innovative procedure, without relying on written material: starting from sparse indication of the harmony and a general feel of a given piece, the group played by watching the movie on a screen in front of them and improvising.\\n\\nReturning to New York in 1958, Davis recruited alto saxophonist Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley. Coltrane, who in the meantime had freed himself from his drug habits, was available after a highly fruitful experience with Thelonious Monk and was hired back, as was Philly Joe Jones. With the quintet re-formed as a sextet, Davis recorded Milestones, an album anticipating the new directions he was preparing to give to his music.\\n\\nAlmost immediately after the recording of Milestones, Davis fired Garland and, shortly afterward, Jones, again for behavioral problems; he replaced them with Bill Evans—a young white pianist with a strong classical background—and drummer Jimmy Cobb. With this revamped formation, Davis began a year during which the sextet performed and toured extensively and produced a record (1958 Miles, also known as 58 Sessions). Evans had a unique, impressionistic approach to the piano, and his musical ideas had a strong influence on Davis. But after only eight months on the road with the group, he was burned out and left. He was soon replaced by Wynton Kelly, a player who brought to the sextet a swinging, bluesy approach that contrasted with Evans\\' more delicate playing.\\n\\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with Gil Evans, often playing flugelhorn as well as trumpet. The first, Miles Ahead (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz big band and a horn section arranged by Evans. Songs included Dave Brubeck\\'s \"The Duke,\" as well as Léo Delibes\\'s \"The Maids of Cadiz,\" the first piece of European classical music Davis had recorded. Another distinctive feature of the album was the orchestral passages that Evans had devised as transitions between the different tracks, which were joined together with the innovative use of editing in the post-production phase, turning each side of the album into a seamless piece of music.\\n\\nIn 1958, Davis and Evans were back in the studio to record Porgy and Bess, an arrangement of pieces from George Gershwin\\'s opera of the same name. The lineup included three members of the sextet: Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones, and Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley. Davis called the album one of his favorites.\\n\\nSketches of Spain (1959–1960) featured songs by contemporary Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo and also Manuel de Falla, as well as Gil Evans originals with a Spanish flavor. Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall (1961) includes Rodrigo\\'s Concierto de Aranjuez, along with other compositions recorded in concert with an orchestra under Evans\\' direction.\\n\\nSessions with Davis and Evans in 1962 resulted in the album Quiet Nights, a short collection of bossa novas that was released against the wishes of both artists: Evans stated it was only half an album, and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer Teo Macero, whom he didn\\'t speak to for more than two years. This was the last time Evans and Davis made a full album together; despite the professional separation, however, Davis noted later that \"my best friend is Gil Evans.\"\\n\\nIn March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet to record what is widely considered his magnum opus, Kind of Blue. He called back Bill Evans, months away from forming what would become his own seminal trio, for the album sessions, as the music had been planned around Evans\\' piano style. Both Davis and Evans were personally acquainted with the ideas of pianist George Russell regarding modal jazz, Davis from discussions with Russell and others before the Birth of the Cool sessions, and Evans from study with Russell in 1956. Davis, however, had neglected to inform current pianist Kelly of Evans\\' role in the recordings; Kelly subsequently played only on the track \"Freddie Freeloader\" and was not present at the April dates for the album. \"So What\" and \"All Blues\" had been played by the sextet at performances prior to the recording sessions, but for the other three compositions, Davis and Evans prepared skeletal harmonic frameworks that the other musicians saw for the first time on the day of recording, to allow a fresher approach to their improvisations. The resulting album has proven to be both highly popular and enormously influential. According to the RIAA, Kind of Blue is the best-selling jazz album of all time, having been certified as quadruple platinum (4 million copies sold). In December 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution honoring the album as a national treasure.\\n\\nThe trumpet Davis used on the recording is currently displayed in the music building on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was donated to the school by Arthur \"Buddy\" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the \"Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program.\"\\n\\nLater in 1959, while taking a break outside the famous Birdland nightclub in New York City, Davis along with others were told by a police officer to clear the side walk and subsequently didn\\'t. The officer said that he would arrest Miles and reached for his cuffs when Miles leaned toward him (boxing style), the police officer fell backward with his cuffs falling. Seconds later a detective came up behind Miles and hit him on the head with a baton resulting in blood getting on his suit. Miles was then arrested, where in the station police harassed him by bumping into him on purpose. Davis attempted to pursue the case in the courts, before eventually dropping the proceedings in a plea bargain in order to recover his suspended Cabaret Card, enabling him to return to work in New York clubs.\\n\\nDavis persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on Davis\\' 1961 album Someday My Prince Will Come. After Coltrane, Davis tried various saxophonists, including Jimmy Heath, Sonny Stitt, and Hank Mobley. The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at Carnegie Hall and the Black Hawk jazz club in San Francisco. Stitt\\'s playing with the group is found on a recording made in Olympia, Paris (where Davis and Coltrane had played a few months before) and the Live in Stockholm album.\\n\\nIn 1963, Davis\\' longtime rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb departed. He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including tenor saxophonist George Coleman and bassist Ron Carter. Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half the tracks for an album in the spring of 1963. A few weeks later, seventeen-year-old drummer Tony Williams and pianist Herbie Hancock joined the group, and soon afterward Davis, Coleman, and the new rhythm section recorded the rest of Seven Steps to Heaven.\\n\\nThe rhythm players melded together quickly as a section and with the horns. The group\\'s rapid evolution can be traced through the Seven Steps to Heaven album, In Europe (July 1963), My Funny Valentine (February 1964), and Four and More (also February 1964). The quintet played essentially the same repertoire of bebop tunes and standards that earlier Davis bands had played, but they tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and, in the case of the up-tempo material, breakneck speed.\\n\\nColeman left in the spring of 1964, to be replaced by avant-garde saxophonist Sam Rivers, on the suggestion of Tony Williams. Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in Japan; this configuration can be heard on Miles in Tokyo! (July 1964).\\n\\nBy the end of the summer, Davis had persuaded Wayne Shorter to leave Art Blakey\\'s Jazz Messengers and join the quintet. Shorter became the group\\'s principal composer, and some of his compositions of this era (including \"Footprints\" and \"Nefertiti\") have become standards. While on tour in Europe, the group quickly made their first official recording, Miles in Berlin (September 1964). On returning to the United States later that year, ever the musical entrepreneur, Davis (at Jackie DeShannon\\'s urging) was instrumental in getting The Byrds signed to Columbia Records.\\n\\nBy the time of E.S.P. (1965), Davis\\' lineup consisted of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter (bass), and Tony Williams (drums). The last of his acoustic bands, this group is often referred to as \"the second great quintet.\"\\n\\nA two-night Chicago performance in late 1965 is captured on The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965, released in 1995. Unlike their studio albums, the live engagement shows the group still playing primarily standards and bebop tunes. It is reasonable to point out though, that whilst some of the titles remain the same as the tunes employed by the 1950s quintet, the speed and distance of departure from the framework of the standards bears no comparison. It could even be said that the listening experience to these standards as live performances is as much of a radical take on the jazz of the time as the new compositions of the studio albums listed below.\\n\\nThe recording of Live at the Plugged Nickel was not issued anywhere in the 1960s, first appearing as a Japan-only partial issue in the late 1970s, then as a double-LP in the USA and Europe in 1982. It was followed by a series of studio recordings: Miles Smiles (1966), Sorcerer (1967), Nefertiti (1967), Miles in the Sky (1968), and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1968). The quintet\\'s approach to improvisation came to be known as \"time no changes\" or \"freebop,\" because they abandoned the more conventional chord-change-based approach of bebop for a modal approach. Through Nefertiti, the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their live concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation. Davis\\'s bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975.\\n\\nMiles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro, on which electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar were tentatively introduced on some tracks, pointed the way to the subsequent fusion phase of Davis\\' career. Davis also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of Filles de Kilimanjaro had been recorded, bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea had replaced Carter and Hancock in the working band, though both Carter and Hancock would occasionally contribute to future recording sessions. Davis soon began to take over the compositional duties of his sidemen.\\n\\nDavis\\' influences included late-1960s acid rock and funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix, many of whom he met through Betty Mabry (later Betty Davis), a young model and songwriter Davis married in September 1968 and divorced a year later. The musical transition required that Davis and his band adapt to electric instruments in both live performances and the studio.\\n\\nBy the time In a Silent Way had been recorded in February 1969, Davis had augmented his quintet with additional players. At various times Hancock or Joe Zawinul was brought in to join Corea on electric keyboards, and guitarist John McLaughlin made the first of his many appearances with Davis. By this point, Shorter was also doubling on soprano saxophone. After recording this album, Williams left to form his group Lifetime and was replaced by Jack DeJohnette.\\n\\nSix months later an even larger group of musicians, including Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and Bennie Maupin, recorded the double LP Bitches Brew, which became a huge seller, reaching gold status by 1976. This album and In a Silent Way were among the first fusions of jazz and rock that were commercially successful, building on the groundwork laid by Charles Lloyd, Larry Coryell, and others who pioneered a genre that would become known as \"jazz-rock fusion\".\\n\\nDuring this period, Davis toured with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette. The group\\'s repertoire included material from Bitches Brew, In a Silent Way, and the 1960s quintet albums, along with an occasional standard.\\n\\nIn 1972, Davis was introduced to the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen by Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote that \"the effect of Davis\\' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. . . . Davis\\' own \\'space music\\' shows Stockhausen\\'s influence compositionally.\" His recordings and performances during this period were described as \"space music\" by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster, who described it as \"a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music.\"\\n\\nBoth Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way feature \"extended\" (more than 20 minutes each) compositions that were never actually \"played straight through\" by the musicians in the studio. Instead, Davis and producer Teo Macero selected musical motifs of various lengths from recorded extended improvisations and edited them together into a musical whole that exists only in the recorded version. Bitches Brew made use of such electronic effects as multi-tracking, tape loops, and other editing techniques. Both records, especially Bitches Brew, proved to be big sellers.\\n\\nStarting with Bitches Brew, Davis\\' albums began to often feature cover art much more in line with psychedelic art or black power movements than that of his earlier albums. He took significant cuts in his usual performing fees in order to open for rock groups like the Steve Miller Band, the Grateful Dead, and Santana. Several live albums were recorded during the early 1970s at these performances: Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970) - It\\'s About That Time, Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West, and Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East.\\n\\nBy the time of Live-Evil in December 1970, Davis\\' ensemble had transformed into a much more funk-oriented group. Davis began experimenting with wah-wah effects on his horn. The ensemble with Gary Bartz, Keith Jarrett, and Michael Henderson, often referred to as the \"Cellar Door band\" (the live portions of Live-Evil were recorded at a Washington, DC, club by that name), never recorded in the studio, but is documented in the six-CD box set The Cellar Door Sessions 1970, which was recorded over four nights in December 1970.\\n\\nIn 1970, Davis contributed extensively to the soundtrack of a documentary about the African-American boxer heavyweight champion Jack Johnson. Himself a devotee of boxing, Davis drew parallels between Johnson, whose career had been defined by the fruitless search for a Great White Hope to dethrone him, and Davis\\' own career, in which he felt the musical establishment of the time had prevented him from receiving the acclaim and rewards that were due him. The resulting album, 1971\\'s A Tribute to Jack Johnson, contained two long pieces that featured musicians (some of whom were not credited on the record) including guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, Herbie Hancock on a Farfisa organ, and drummer Billy Cobham. McLaughlin and Cobham went on to become founding members of the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1971.\\n\\nAs Davis stated in his autobiography, he wanted to make music for the young African-American audience. On the Corner (1972) blended funk elements with the traditional jazz styles he had played his entire career. The album was highlighted by the appearance of saxophonist Carlos Garnett. Critics were not kind to the album; in his autobiography, Davis stated that critics could not figure out how to categorize it, and he complained that the album was not promoted by the \"traditional\" jazz radio stations.\\n\\nAfter recording On the Corner, Davis put together a new group, with only Michael Henderson, Carlos Garnett, and percussionist Mtume returning from the previous band. It included guitarist Reggie Lucas, tabla player Badal Roy, sitarist Khalil Balakrishna, and drummer Al Foster. It was unusual in that none of the sidemen were major jazz instrumentalists; as a result, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of individual solos. This group, which recorded in the Philharmonic Hall for the album In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall (1972), was unsatisfactory to Davis. Through the first half of 1973, he dropped the tabla and sitar, took over keyboard duties, and added guitarist Pete Cosey. The Davis/Cosey/Lucas/Henderson/Mtume/Foster ensemble would remain virtually intact over the next two years. Initially, Dave Liebman played saxophones and flute with the band; in 1974, he was replaced by Sonny Fortune.\\n\\nBig Fun (1974) was a double album containing four long improvisations, recorded between 1969 and 1972. Similarly, Get Up With It (1974) collected recordings from the previous five years. Get Up With It included \"He Loved Him Madly\", a tribute to Duke Ellington, as well as one of Davis\\' most lauded pieces from this era, \"Calypso Frelimo\". It was his last studio album of the 1970s.\\n\\nIn 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: Dark Magus, Agharta, and Pangaea. Dark Magus captures a 1974 New York concert; the latter two are recordings of consecutive concerts from the same February 1975 day in Osaka. At the time, only Agharta was available in the US; Pangaea and Dark Magus were initially released only by CBS/Sony Japan. All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of Hendrix-inspired electronic distortion devices; Dominique Gaumont is a third guitarist on Dark Magus), electric bass, drums, reeds, and Davis on electric trumpet and organ. These albums were the last he was to record for five years. Davis was troubled by osteoarthritis (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, ulcers, and a renewed dependence on alcohol and drugs (primarily cocaine), and his performances were routinely panned by critics throughout late 1974 and early 1975. By the time the group reached Japan in February 1975, Davis was nearing a physical breakdown and required copious amounts of alcohol and narcotics to make it through his engagements. Nonetheless, as noted by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, during these concerts his trumpet playing \"is of the highest and most adventurous order.\"\\n\\nAfter a Newport Jazz Festival performance at Avery Fisher Hall in New York on July 1, 1975, Davis withdrew almost completely from the public eye for six years. As Gil Evans said, \"His organism is tired. And after all the music he\\'s contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest.\"\\n\\nDavis characterized this period in his memoirs as a colorful time when wealthy women lavished him with sex and drugs. In reality, he had become completely dependent on various drugs, spending nearly all of his time propped up on a couch in his apartment watching television, leaving only to find more drugs. In 1976, Rolling Stone reported rumors of his imminent demise. Although he stopped practicing trumpet on a regular basis, Davis continued to compose intermittently and made three attempts at recording during his exile from performing; these sessions (one with the assistance of Paul Buckmaster and Gil Evans, who left after not receiving promised compensation) bore little fruit and remain unreleased.\\n\\nIn 1979, he placed in the yearly top-ten trumpeter poll of Down Beat. Columbia continued to issue compilation albums and records of unreleased vault material to fulfill contractual obligations.\\n\\nDuring his period of inactivity, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade enter into the mainstream. When he emerged from retirement, Davis\\' musical descendants would be in the realm of New Wave rock, and in particular the styling of Prince.\\n\\nBy 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress Cicely Tyson. With Tyson, Davis would overcome his cocaine addiction and regain his enthusiasm for music. As he had not played trumpet for the better part of three years, regaining his famed embouchure proved to be particularly arduous. While recording The Man with the Horn (sessions were spread sporadically over 1979–1981), Davis played mostly wahwah with a younger, larger band.\\n\\nThe initial large band was eventually abandoned in favor of a smaller combo featuring saxophonist Bill Evans and bass player Marcus Miller, both of whom would be among Davis\\' most regular collaborators throughout the decade. He married Tyson in 1981; they would divorce in 1988. The Man with the Horn was finally released in 1981 and received a poor critical reception despite selling fairly well. In May, the new band played two dates as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. The concerts, as well as the live recording We Want Miles from the ensuing tour, received positive reviews.\\n\\nBy late 1982, Davis\\' band included French percussionist Mino Cinelu and guitarist John Scofield, with whom he worked closely on the album Star People. In mid-1983, while working on the tracks for Decoy, an album mixing soul music and electronica that was released in 1984, Davis brought in producer, composer and keyboardist Robert Irving III, who had earlier collaborated with him on The Man with the Horn. With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, keyboardist and music director Irving, drummer Al Foster and bassist Darryl Jones (later of The Rolling Stones), Davis played a series of European gigs to positive receptions. While in Europe, he took part in the recording of Aura, an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. You\\'re Under Arrest, Davis\\' next album, was released in 1985 and included another brief stylistic detour. Included on the album were his interpretations of Cyndi Lauper\\'s ballad \"Time After Time,\" and \"Human Nature\" from Michael Jackson. Davis considered releasing an entire album of pop songs and recorded dozens of them, but the idea was scrapped. Davis noted that many of today\\'s accepted jazz standards were in fact pop songs from Broadway theater, and that he was simply updating the \"standards\" repertoire with new material.\\n\\nYou\\'re Under Arrest also proved to be Davis\\' final album for Columbia. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis publicly dismissed Davis\\' more recent fusion recordings as not being \"\\'true\\' jazz\", comments Davis initially shrugged off, calling Marsalis \"a nice young man, only confused\". This changed after Marsalis appeared, unannounced, onstage in the midst of a Davis performance. Marsalis whispered into Davis\\' ear that \"someone\" had told him to do so; Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.\\n\\nDavis grew irritated at Columbia\\'s delay releasing Aura. The breaking point in the label-artist relationship appears to have come when a Columbia jazz producer requested Davis place a goodwill birthday call to Marsalis. Davis signed with Warner Brothers shortly thereafter.\\n\\nDavis collaborated with a number of figures from the British new wave movement during this period, including Scritti Politti. At the invitation of producer Bill Laswell, Davis recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd\\'s Album, according to Public Image\\'s John Lydon in the liner notes of their Plastic Box box set. In Lydon\\'s words, however, \"strangely enough, we didn\\'t use (his contributions).\" (Also according to Lydon in the Plastic Box notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon\\'s singing voice to his trumpet sound.)\\n\\nHaving first taken part in the Artists United Against Apartheid recording, Davis signed with Warner Brothers records and reunited with Marcus Miller. The resulting record, Tutu (1986), would be his first to use modern studio tools — programmed synthesizers, samples and drum loops — to create an entirely new setting for Davis\\' playing. Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as the modern counterpart of Sketches of Spain and won a Grammy in 1987.\\n\\nHe followed Tutu with Amandla, another collaboration with Miller and George Duke, plus the soundtracks to four movies: Street Smart, Siesta, The Hot Spot, and Dingo. He continued to tour with a band of constantly rotating personnel and a critical stock at a level higher than it had been for 15 years. His last recordings, both released posthumously, were the hip hop-influenced studio album Doo-Bop and Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux, a collaboration with Quincy Jones for the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival in which Davis performed the repertoire from his 1940s and 1950s recordings for the first time in decades.\\n\\nIn 1988 he had a small part as a street musician in the film Scrooged, starring Bill Murray. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In 1989, Miles was interviewed on the television show \\'60 minutes\\' by Harry Reasoner.\\n\\nIn early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film Dingo as a jazz musician. In the film\\'s opening sequence, Davis and his band unexpectedly land on a remote airstrip in the Australian outback and proceed to perform for the stunned locals. The performance was one of Davis\\' last on film.\\n\\nMiles Davis died on September 28, 1991 from a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure in Santa Monica, California at the age of 65. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.\\n\\nMiles Davis is regarded as one of the most innovative, influential and respected figures in the history of jazz music. He has been described as “one of the great innovators in jazz”. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll noted \"Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-\\'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style - in attitude and fashion - as well as music\". His album Kind of Blue is the best-selling album in the history of jazz music and was praised by the United States House of Representatives to \"pass a symbolic resolution honoring the masterpiece and reaffirming jazz as a national treasure.\"\\n\\nAs an innovative bandleader and composer, Miles Davis has influenced many notable musicians and bands from diverse genres. These include Wayne Shorter, Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Hancock, Lalo Schifrin, Tangerine Dream, Brand X, Mtume, Benny Bailey, Joe Bonner, Don Cherry, Urszula Dudziak, Bill Evans, Bill Hardman, The Lounge Lizards, Hugh Masekela , John McLaughlin, King Crimson, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa, Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, Lydia Lunch, Talk Talk, Michael Franks, Sting, Lonnie Liston Smith, Jiří Stivín, Tim Hagans, Julie Christensen, Vassar Clements, Snooky Young, Prince and Christian Scott.\\n\\nMiles\\' influence on the people who played with him has been described by music writer and author Christopher Smith as follows:\\n\\nMiles Davis\\' artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary. [...] Miles\\' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.\\n\\nHis approach, owing largely to the African American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.\\n\\nIn 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Miles Davis an Honorary Doctorate for his extraordinary contributions to music. Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) has honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

September 1991 in Santa Monica, Kalifornien) war ein amerikanischer Jazz-Trompeter, -Flügelhornist, Komponist und Bandleader und einer der einflussreichsten Jazzmusiker des 20. Jh. Nachdem er an der sogenannten Bebop-Revolution teilgenommen hatte, beeinflusste Davis maßgeblich die Entwicklung unterschiedlicher Jazz-Stile wie Cool Jazz, Hard Bop, modalen Jazz und Jazzrock. Sowohl als Instrumentalist wie auch als kreativer Geist gelang es Miles Davis, seine eigenen künstlerischen Ideen zu verwirklichen und gleichzeitig kommerziell erfolgreich zu sein.\n\nErste Berühmtheit erlangte Miles Davis als Bebop-Jazzer und Sideman von Charlie Parker. In den 46 Jahren seines musikalischen Schaffens arbeitete er mit Musikern wie John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul, John McLaughlin und Gil Evans zusammen. Da er regelmäßig talentierte Musiker, von denen er neue Impulse erwartete, in seine Band holte und ihnen Raum zur Entfaltung gab, verdanken zahlreiche Jazz-Größen ihren Durchbruch als Musiker der Zusammenarbeit mit Davis.\n\nSeit Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts erfahren seine Alben und Kompositionen große Anerkennung bei Musikkritikern und Fans gleichermaßen. Sie gelten als Klassiker und Meisterwerke des Jazz. Davis selbst wurde u. a. zum besten Trompetenspieler gekürt. Als besondere Würdigung des Werks von Miles Davis verabschiedete das Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten am 15. Dezember 2009 eine symbolische Resolution anlässlich des 50. Jahrestags der Aufnahme seines Albums Kind of Blue zur „Ehrung des Meisterwerks und zur Bekräftigung, dass Jazz ein nationales Kulturgut ist“.\n(Wikipedia)",

      "biography_fr": "Miles Dewey Davis III (26 mai 1926, Alton, Illinois - 28 septembre 1991, Santa Monica, Californie) est un compositeur et trompettiste de jazz américain.\n\nMiles Davis commence à jouer de la trompette à l'âge de douze ans. Il fut à la pointe de beaucoup d'évolutions dans le jazz et s'est particulièrement distingué par sa capacité à découvrir et à s'entourer de nouveaux talents. Son jeu se caractérise par une grande sensibilité musicale et par la fragilité qu'il arrive à donner au son. Il marque l'histoire du jazz et de la musique du XXe siècle. Beaucoup de grands noms du jazz des années 1940 à 1980 travaillent avec lui.\n\nLes différentes formations de Miles Davis sont comme des laboratoires au sein desquels se sont révélés les talents de nouvelles générations et les nouveaux horizons de la musique moderne ; notamment Sonny Rollins, Julian « Cannonball » Adderley, Bill Evans et John Coltrane durant les années 1950. De 1960 aux années 1980 ses sidemen se nomment Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, George Coleman, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, Tony Williams, Joe Zawinul, Dave Liebman et Kenny Garrett ; c'est avec eux qu'il s'oriente vers la « fusion » du rock et du jazz, dont il reste l'un des pionniers. La découverte de la musique de Jimi Hendrix est déterminante dans cette évolution, mais surtout le choc du festival de Newport, en 1969, où l'on assiste à l'origine exclusivement à des concerts de jazz, mais qui, cette année-là, programme du rock. Nombre de musiciens qui passent par ses formations de 1963 à 1969 forment ensuite les groupes emblématiques du jazz-rock fusion, notamment Weather Report, animé par Wayne Shorter et Joe Zawinul, Mahavishnu Orchestra de John McLaughlin, Return to Forever de Chick Corea, ainsi que les différents groupes de Herbie Hancock.\n\nMiles Davis est un des rares jazzmen et l'un des premiers musiciens noirs à s'être fait connaître et accepter par l'Amérique moyenne, remportant même le trophée de l'homme le mieux habillé de l'année du mensuel GQ pendant les années 1960. Comme Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis est ce phénomène curieux, une superstar du jazz. À la différence de son glorieux aîné qui avait recherché l'intégration à la culture grand public dominée par la population blanche, le parcours musical de Miles Davis s'accompagne d'une prise de position politique en faveur de la cause noire et de sa lutte contre le racisme, menée avec la colère permanente d'un homme au caractère réputé ombrageux. En 1985, il participe à l'album Sun City contre l'apartheid à l'initiative de Steven van Zandt.\n\nEn France, c'est l'enregistrement de la musique du film Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (1957) de Louis Malle qui le rend célèbre. Son dernier album, Doo-bop, paru en 1992 après sa mort, laisse éclater des influences rap.",

      "biography_nl": "Miles Dewey Davis III (Alton (Illinois), 26 mei 1926 – Santa Monica (Californië), 28 september 1991) was een Amerikaans jazzcomponist, trompettist en multi-instrumentalist. Hij wordt door verschillende deskundigen beschouwd als één van de meest invloedrijke, vernieuwende en originele muzikanten van de twintigste eeuw.\n\nDavis speelde naast onder anderen Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington en John Coltrane een grote rol in de geschiedenis van de jazz. Hij speelde verschillende stijlen, waaronder bop, cool jazz, modale jazz en jazzrockfusion. Miles was een spil in de ontwikkeling van de laatstgenoemde drie stijlen. Als gevolg hiervan wordt Miles the Picasso of jazz genoemd.\n\nDe stijl van Davis is herkenbaar en origineel en oefent tot op decennia na zijn overlijden invloed uit op jazzmusici. Op een deel van zijn opnames gebruikte Davis een harmon mute, een type demper waarmee hij het typische timbre creëerde dat tijdens de rest van zijn carrière direct met hem geassocieerd bleef worden. Ook zijn klank en speelstijl zonder de mute is herkenbaar, onder meer door de typische afbuigingen aan het begin of eind van de tonen en de ingehouden lyrische speelstijl met lange stiltes tussen de melodische frasen.\n\nIn 1945, nadat hij zijn middelbare school had afgerond en een korte tijd met Charlie Parker in Billy Ecksteins band speelde, verhuisde Davis naar New York, ogenschijnlijk om met een beurs aan de Juilliard School of Music te studeren. In werkelijkheid verwaarloosde hij zijn opleiding en ging hij op zoek naar zijn helden, zoals Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk en Coleman Hawkins. Tevens ging hij geregeld op pad met één van zijn andere idolen, Dizzy Gillespie. Zij werden goede vrienden.\n\nDavis schreef over zijn helden samen met Quincy Troupe in zijn autobiografie Miles: \"When I heard Diz and Bird in B's band, I said, \"What? What is this!?\" Man, that shit was so terrible that it was scary. I mean, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker, Buddy Anderson, Gene Amons, Lucky Thompson an Art Blakey all together in one band and not to mention B: Billy Eckstine himself. It was a motherfucker. Man, that shit was all up in my body. Music all up in my body, and that's what I wanted to hear.\"\n\nTegen 1949 had hij aan zijn 'proeftijd' als medespeler voldaan, zowel op het podium als op plaatopnames. Zijn eigen opnamecarrière bloeide vervolgens op. In datzelfde jaar begon Davis samen te werken met Gil Evans. Deze samenwerking bleef de volgende twintig jaar voor veel van zijn grote werken bestaan. De platen die zij in de late jaren veertig maakten, werden de eerste tien jaar beperkt gepubliceerd.\n\nVia de jazzclubs van New York kwam Davis regelmatig in contact met zowel gebruikers als verkopers van illegale drugs. Tegen 1950 had hij een serieuze heroïneverslaving, mogelijk verergerd door de weinig enthousiaste ontvangst van zijn eerste persoonlijke opnames.\n\nIn het eerste deel van de jaren vijftig leek het talent dat Davis bezat verloren te gaan. Hij speelde verscheidene sessies (gigs), maar deze waren ongeïnspireerd. Davis was zich hiervan bewust en keerde in 1954 terug naar East Saint Louis, waar hij met hulp van zijn vader probeerde af te kicken. Die dacht onterecht dat het met zijn gebit te maken had. Davis sloot zich letterlijk van de maatschappij af tot hij vrij van zijn drugsverslaving zou zijn. Hoewel hij later beweerde dat hij sindsdien geen drugs meer gebruikte, schijnt hij in werkelijkheid verslaafd te zijn gebleven.\n\nAls herboren keerde hij terug naar New York en richtte er de eerste grote versie van het Miles Davis Quintet op. In deze band speelden de jonge John Coltrane (oorspronkelijk enkel tenor- en later ook sopraansaxofoon) en soms enkele andere indertijd bekende jazzartiesten, zoals Sonny Rollins (tenorsax) en Charles Mingus (bas).\n\nMuzikaal ging de groep door waar Davis in zijn sessies in de late jaren veertig ophield. Ze vermeden de ritmische en harmonische complexiteit van de overheersende bebop en Davis kreeg de ruimte om lange, legato en in wezen melodische lijnen te spelen, waarin hij de modale muziek leerde doorgronden. Dit was een levenslange obsessie voor hem.\n\nDeze opnames, beginnend met Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, bepaalden samen met de 'Birth of the Cool'-opnames uit 1948 het geluid van de cool jazz, een van de dominante trends in de muziek voor het komende decennium en later.\n\nTerwijl de rest van het muziekestablishment nog steeds probeerde de vernieuwingen van Davis te accepteren, was hij zelf verder. Herenigd met Gil Evans nam hij een serie albums van grote verscheidenheid en complexiteit op, waarin hij in vrijwel elke muzikale context zijn beheersing van zijn instrument toonde.\n\nOp het eerste album, Miles Ahead (1957), speelde hij met een traditionele jazzbigband. Deze had een gedreven kopersectie gearrangeerd door Gil Evans. Naast jazznummers (waaronder The Duke van Dave Brubeck) gingen de twee het gevecht aan met Les Filles de Cadix van Léo Delibes. Dit was de eerste keer dat Davis Europese klassieke muziek opnam.\n\nMilestones 1958 ving het geluid van zijn huidige sextet, dat nu bestond uit Davis, John Coltrane, Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley (altsax), Red Garland (piano), Paul Chambers (bas) en Philly Joe Jones (drums).\n\nMuzikaal gezien omvatte dit album zowel het verleden als de toekomst van de jazz. Davis liet zien dat hij blues en bebop kon spelen (begeleid door Garland), maar het centerpiece is het titelnummer, een compositie van Davis rond de dorische en aeolische modi en met de vrije improvisionele modale stijl die Davis zich eigen maakte.\n\nDeze modale stijl kwam tot bloei op Kind of Blue (1959) en werd de best verkochte jazzplaat uit de geschiedenis tot dan toe. Het sextet improviseerde op korte modale thema’s die vooraf niet waren geoefend. In de groep nam Bill Evans de piano over en hij zorgde daarbij voor klassieke invloeden in de groep. Op één van de tracks speelde Wynton Kelly piano. Hij werd later een vast lid van de groep.\n\nNa Kind of Blue viel de groep uiteen. Coltrane, Evans en Adderley gingen verder als bandleiders. Miles vond minder inspiratie en zijn groep veranderde geregeld van bezetting. In 1964 vormde hij zijn tweede grote kwintet. Herbie Hancock op piano, Wayne Shorter op saxofoon, Ron Carter op bas en de nog jonge Tony Williams op drums. Davis stelde: \"Je moet eerst de regels kennen om ze vervolgens te kunnen breken.\" Live werden jazzstandards gespeeld waarbij de grenzen van de traditie werden opgezocht. Lange improvisaties met veel nadruk op harmonische grenzen en een hecht groepsspel, waardoor hij meer dan daarvoor met textuur kon spelen. Live speelde hij standards en in de studio nieuw werk, vooral composities van zijn saxofonist Wayne Shorter. De grenzen werden bereikt op Live at Plugged Nickel (uitgegeven als 8cd box). Het vormde een tegenstem voor de freejazz van Ornette Coleman, die Davis in zijn autobiografie verguisde.\n\nn juni 1970 kwamen onder anderen Davis, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette en John McLaughlin vier nachten samen in de bescheiden nachtclub The Cellar Door in Washington D.C. Van die optredens kwam in 2006 een 6-cd-box uit.\n\nAan het eind van de jaren zestig 'ging' Davis elektrisch met een elektrische piano, elektrische bas en een elektrische gitaar. De 'groove' werd belangrijk. Nadat Davis op het Isle of Wight Festival Machine Gun van Jimi Hendrix hoorde wilde Davis direct een band met hem beginnen. \"It's that goddamned motherfucking 'Machine Gun.'\" antwoordde Miles op een vraag wat hij vond van de muziek van Hendrix. Door het het overlijden van Hendrix vond die nooit plaats. Volgens Rolling Stone magazine was \"In a Silent Way de ideale plaat om stoned op te worden\". In de jaren zeventig probeerde hij ook zwarte jongeren te bereiken door funk-invloeden in zijn muziek te stoppen. Bitches Brew werd een mijlpaal voor de opkomende jazz-fusion muziek.\n\nEind 1975 trok Davis zich terug uit de muziek en wilde hij geen trompet meer spelen. Hij kampte met een slechte gezondheid, gedeeltelijk veroorzaakt door jaren overmatig drugsgebruik.\n\nDavis keerde toch terug in de muziek. Zijn stijl veranderde meer naar een popstijl. Hij speelde liedjes als Time After Time en Human Nature (van Michael Jackson). Verschillende van de musici met wie hij speelde, verkasten één voor één naar Sting, die op You're under arrest een politieman speelde. In deze stijl speelde hij tot aan zijn dood. Hij verwierf ook als beeldend kunstenaar bekendheid. Eén van zijn vaste muzikale partners werd Marcus Miller.\n\nHij ondernam nog een paar projecten:\n\n1) Met Quincy Jones keerde hij voor het eerst terug naar de muziek die hij vroeger speelde met Gil Evans.\n2) Aura, dat de platenmaatschappij jarenlang 'op de plank' liet liggen.\n3)Hij speelde op uitnodiging van Prince een concert in diens studiocomplex Paisley Park in Minneapolis.\n\nDe Franse beeldhouwster Niki de Saint Phalle vereeuwigde Davis in een beeld, dat de tuin siert van het belle époque-hotel Negresco aan de Promenade des Anglais in Nice. Tevens staat er een beeld van hem in de Poolse plaats Kielce (zie foto).\n\nDavis scheidde in 1988 van actrice Cicely Tyson, per november 1981 zijn derde en laatste echtgenote. Eerder was hij getrouwd met Frances Taylor (1958-1968) en met Betty Mabry (1968-1969). Davis kreeg vier kinderen, Cheryl (1944), Gregory, (1946), Miles IV (1950) en Erin (1970).\n",
      "biography_pt": "Miles Dewey Davis Jr (Alton, 26 de maio de 1926 – Santa Mônica, 28 de Setembro de 1991) foi um trompetista, compositor e bandleader de jazz norte-americano.\n\nConsiderado um dos mais influentes músicos do século XX, Davis esteve na vanguarda de quase todos os desenvolvimentos do jazz desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial até a década de 1990. Ele participou de várias gravações do bebop e das primeiras gravações do cool jazz. Foi parte do desenvolvimento do jazz modal, e também do jazz fusion que originou-se do trabalho dele com outros músicos no final da década de 1960 e no começo da década de 1970.\n\nMiles Davis pertenceu a uma classe tradicional de trompetistas de jazz, que começou com Buddy Bolden e desenvolveu-se com Joe \"King\" Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Roy Eldridge e Dizzy Gillespie. Ao contrário desses músicos ele nunca foi considerado com um alto nível de habilidade técnica. Seu grande êxito como músico, entretanto, foi ir mais além do que ser influente e distinto em seu instrumento, e moldar estilos inteiros e maneiras de fazer música através dos seus trabalhos. Muitos dos mais importantes músicos de jazz fizeram seu nome na segunda metade do século XX nos grupos de Miles Davis, incluindo: Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea e Herbie Hancock, os saxofonistas John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, George Coleman e Kenny Garrett, o baterista Tony Williams e o guitarrista John McLaughlin.\n\nComo trompetista Davis tinha um som puro e claro, mas também uma incomum liberdade de articulação e altura. Ele ficou conhecido por ter um registro baixo e minimalista de tocar, mas também era capaz de conseguir alta complexidade e técnica com seu trompete.\n\nEm 13 de Março de 2006, Davis foi postumamente incluído no Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ele foi também incluído no St. Louis Walk of Fame, Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame, e no Down Beat's Jazz Hall of Fame.",

      "profile": "Trumpeter, bandleader, and composer\r\nBorn May 26, 1926 in Alton, Illinois, USA, died September 28, 1991 in Santa Monica, California, USA (aged 65)\r\n\r\nOne of the most important figures in jazz history, Davis adopted multiple musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. His album \"[m=5460]\" (1959) is the highest selling jazz album ever with over five million copies sold.\r\n\r\nMiles settled in New York City to study at Juilliard School. He made his professional debut as a member of [a272028] from 1944 to 1948. In 1948, Davis began to found his own ensembles. At that time, he met [a255137], who contributed to [a497768]'s scores and arrangements. The dozen sides they recorded in 1949-50 were eventually assembled as the LP \"[m=62308]\" (1957), with Davis and Evans working together again from 1957 on further projects.\r\n\r\nMiles Davis was prominent in the creation of the 'Hard Bop' style in the mid-1950s (his first regular quintet featured [a97545]), and the \"time, no changes\" approach in his second quintet a decade later. In the late 1960s, he introduced electronic instruments and rock and funk rhythms in his music. Around 1975, he went on a hiatus over health and personal problems, re-emerging in 1980.\r\n\r\nHe married dancer/actress [a7671712] on December 12, 1959; the couple divorced in 1968. He then married singer [a1076460] in September 1968; they divorced in 1970. He then married actress [a6279083] on November 26, 1981; they divorced in 1989. Father of [a680784] and [a1493787]. Uncle of [a279708] (Jr).\r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 (Performer).\r\n\r\nWinner of eight Grammy Awards:\r\n- Best Jazz Composition Of More Than Five Minutes Duration for Sketches Of Spain on [m=48172]\r\n- Best Jazz Performance - Large Group Or Soloist With Large Group for [m=8260]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist for [m=65130]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist for [m=63355]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Big Band for [m=62288]\r\n- Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist (On A Jazz Recording) for [m=62288]\r\n- Best R&B Instrumental Performance for [m=62359]\r\n- Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance for [m=188032]",

        "profile": "Trumpeter, bandleader, and composer\r\nBorn May 26, 1926 in Alton, Illinois, USA, died September 28, 1991 in Santa Monica, California, USA (aged 65)\r\n\r\nOne of the most important figures in jazz history, Davis adopted multiple musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. His album \"[m=5460]\" (1959) is the highest selling jazz album ever with over five million copies sold.\r\n\r\nMiles settled in New York City to study at Juilliard School. He made his professional debut as a member of [a272028] from 1944 to 1948. In 1948, Davis began to found his own ensembles. At that time, he met [a255137], who contributed to [a497768]'s scores and arrangements. The dozen sides they recorded in 1949-50 were eventually assembled as the LP \"[m=62308]\" (1957), with Davis and Evans working together again from 1957 on further projects.\r\n\r\nMiles Davis was prominent in the creation of the 'Hard Bop' style in the mid-1950s (his first regular quintet featured [a97545]), and the \"time, no changes\" approach in his second quintet a decade later. In the late 1960s, he introduced electronic instruments and rock and funk rhythms in his music. Around 1975, he went on a hiatus over health and personal problems, re-emerging in 1980.\r\n\r\nHe married dancer/actress [a7671712] on December 12, 1959; the couple divorced in 1968. He then married singer [a1076460] in September 1968; they divorced in 1970. He then married actress [a6279083] on November 26, 1981; they divorced in 1989. Father of [a680784] and [a1493787].

      "bio_content": "Miles Davis (Miles Dewey Davis III, Alton, Illinois, May 26, 1926 – Santa Monica, California, September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader and composer.\n\nWidely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion. Many well-known musicians rose to prominence as members of Davis' ensembles, including saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, George Coleman, Wayne Shorter, Dave Liebman, Branford Marsalis and Kenny Garrett; trombonist J. J. Johnson; pianists Horace Silver, Red Garland, Wynton Kelly, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Keith Jarrett; guitarists John McLaughlin, John Scofield and Mike Stern; bassists Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, Marcus Miller and Darryl Jones, ; and drummers Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, Jack DeJohnette, and Al Foster.\n\nMiles Davis was born on May 26, 1926, to a relatively affluent family in Alton, Illinois. His father, Dr. Miles Henry Davis, was a dentist. In 1927 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They also owned a substantial ranch in northern Arkansas, where Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.\n\nDavis' mother, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but kept this fact hidden from her son. His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan. Davis later suggested that his father's instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet's sound. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato; he was reported to have slapped Davis' knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato. Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, \"I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything.\" Clark Terry was another important early influence.\n\nBy age 16, Davis was a member of the music society and playing professionally when not at school. At 17, he spent a year playing in Eddie Randle's band, the Blue Devils. During this time, Sonny Stitt tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, then passing through town, but Davis' mother insisted that he finish his final year of high school.\n\nIn 1944, the Billy Eckstine band visited East St. Louis. Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were members of the band, and Davis was brought in on third trumpet for a couple of weeks because the regular player, Buddy Anderson, was out sick. Even after this experience, once Eckstine's band left town, Davis' parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies.\n\nIn the fall of 1944, following graduation from high school, Davis moved to New York City to study at the Juilliard School of Music.\n\nUpon arriving in New York, he spent most of his first weeks in town trying to get in contact with Charlie Parker, despite being advised against doing so by several people he met during his quest, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins.\n\nFinally locating his idol, Davis became one of the cadre of musicians who held nightly jam sessions at two of Harlem's nightclubs, Minton's Playhouse and Monroe's. The group included many of the future leaders of the bebop revolution: young players such as Fats Navarro, Freddie Webster, and J. J. Johnson. Established musicians including Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke were also regular participants.\n\nDavis dropped out of Juilliard, after asking permission from his father. In his autobiography, Davis criticized the Juilliard classes for centering too much on the classical European and \"white\" repertoire. However, he also acknowledged that Juilliard helped give him a grounding in music theory that would prove valuable in later years.\n\nDavis began playing professionally, performing in several 52nd Street clubs with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis. In 1945, he entered a recording studio for the first time, as a member of Herbie Fields's group. This was the first of many recordings to which Davis contributed in this period, mostly as a sideman. He finally got the chance to record as a leader in 1946, with an occasional group called the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway—one of the rare occasions when Davis, by then a member of the groundbreaking Charlie Parker Quintet, can be heard accompanying singers. In these early years, recording sessions where Davis was the leader were the exception rather than the rule; his next date as leader would not come until 1947.\n\nAround 1945, Dizzy Gillespie parted ways with Parker, and Davis was hired as Gillespie's replacement in his quintet, which also featured Max Roach on drums, Al Haig (replaced later by Sir Charles Thompson and Duke Jordan) on piano, and Curley Russell (later replaced by Tommy Potter and Leonard Gaskin) on bass.\n\nWith Parker's quintet, Davis went into the studio several times, already showing hints of the style for which he would become known. On an oft-quoted take of Parker's signature song, \"Now's the Time\", Davis takes a melodic solo, whose unbop-like quality anticipates the \"cool jazz\" period that would follow. The Parker quintet also toured widely. During a stop in Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that landed him in the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for several months, and Davis found himself stranded. He roomed and collaborated for some time with bassist Charles Mingus, before getting a job on Billy Eckstine's California tour, which eventually brought him back to New York. In 1948, Parker returned to New York, and Davis rejoined his group.\n\nThe relationships within the quintet, however, were growing tense. Parker's erratic behavior (attributable to his well-known drug addiction) and artistic choices (both Davis and Roach objected to having Duke Jordan as a pianist and would have preferred Bud Powell) became sources of friction. In December 1948, disputes over money (Davis claims he was not being paid) began to strain their relationship even further. Davis finally left the group following a confrontation with Parker at the Royal Roost.\n\nFor Davis, his departure from Parker's group marked the beginning of a period in which he worked mainly as a freelancer and as a sideman in some of the most important combos on the New York jazz scene.\n\nIn 1948 Davis grew close to the Canadian composer and arranger Gil Evans. Evans' house had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers (including Davis, Roach, pianist John Lewis, and baritone sax player Gerry Mulligan) unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumentalism that dominated the bebop scene of the time. Evans had been the arranger for the Claude Thornhill orchestra, and it was the sound of this group, as well as Duke Ellington's example, that suggested the creation of an unusual line-up: a nonet including a French horn and a tuba (this accounts for the \"tuba band\" moniker that was to be associated with the combo).\n\nDavis took an active role in the project, so much so that it soon became \"his project\". The objective was to achieve a sound similar to the human voice, through carefully arranged compositions and by emphasizing a relaxed, melodic approach to the improvisations.\n\nThe nonet debuted in the summer of 1948, with a two-week engagement at the Royal Roost. The sign announcing the performance gave a surprising prominence to the role of the arrangers: \"Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan\". It was, in fact, so unusual that Davis had to persuade the Roost's manager, Ralph Watkins, to allow the sign to be worded in this way; he prevailed only with the help of Monte Kay, the club's artistic director.\n\nThe nonet was active until the end of 1949, along the way undergoing several changes in personnel: Roach and Davis were constantly featured, along with Mulligan, tuba player Bill Barber, and alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, who had been preferred to Sonny Stitt (whose playing was considered too bop-oriented). Over the months, John Lewis alternated with Al Haig on piano, Mike Zwerin with Kai Winding on trombone (Johnson was touring at the time), Junior Collins with Sandy Siegelstein and Gunther Schuller on French horn, and Al McKibbon with Joe Shulman on bass. Singer Kenny Hagood was added for one track during the recording sessions.\n\nThe presence of white musicians in the group angered some African American jazz players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.\n\nA contract with Capitol Records granted the nonet several recording sessions between January 1949 and April 1950. The material they recorded was released in 1956 on an album whose title, Birth of the Cool, gave its name to the \"cool jazz\" movement that developed at the same time and partly shared the musical direction begun by Davis' group.\n\nFor his part, Davis was fully aware of the importance of the project, which he pursued to the point of turning down a job with Duke Ellington's orchestra.\n\nThe importance of the nonet experience would become clear to critics and the larger public only in later years, but, at least commercially, the nonet was not a success. The liner notes of the first recordings of the Davis Quintet for Columbia Records call it one of the most spectacular failures of the jazz club scene. This was bitterly noted by Davis, who claimed the invention of the cool style and resented the success that was later enjoyed—in large part because of the media's attention—by white \"cool jazz\" musicians (Mulligan and Dave Brubeck in particular).\n\nThis experience also marked the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Davis and Gil Evans, an alliance that would bear important results in the years to follow.\n\nThe first half of the 1950s was, for Davis, a period of great personal difficulty. At the end of 1949, he went on tour in Paris with a group including Tadd Dameron, Kenny Clarke (who remained in Europe after the tour), and James Moody. Davis was fascinated by Paris and its cultural environment, where black jazz musicians, and African Americans in general, often felt better respected than they did in their homeland. While in Paris, Davis began a relationship with French actress and singer Juliette Greco.\n\nMany of his new and old friends (Davis, in his autobiography, mentions Clarke) tried to persuade him to stay in France, but Davis decided to return to New York. Back in the States, he began to feel deeply depressed. The depression was due in part to his separation from Greco, in part to his feeling underappreciated by the critics (who were hailing Davis' former collaborators as leaders of the cool jazz movement), and in part to the unraveling of his liaison with a former St. Louis schoolmate who was living with him in New York and with whom he had two children.\n\nThese are the factors to which Davis traces a heroin habit that deeply affected him for the next four years. Though Davis denies it in his autobiography, it is also likely that the environment in which he was living played a role. Most of Davis' associates at the time, some of them perhaps in imitation of Charlie Parker, had drug addictions of their own (among them, sax players Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon, trumpeters Fats Navarro and Freddie Webster, and drummer Art Blakey). For the next four years, Davis supported his habit partly with his music and partly by living the life of a hustler. By 1953, his drug addiction was beginning to impair his ability to perform. Heroin had killed some of his friends (Navarro and Freddie Webster). He himself had been arrested for drug possession while on tour in Los Angeles, and his drug habit had been made public in a devastating interview that Cab Calloway gave to Down Beat.\n\nRealizing his precarious condition, Davis tried several times to end his drug addiction, finally succeeding in 1954 after returning to his father's home in St. Louis for several months and literally locking himself in a room until he had gone through a painful withdrawal. During this period he avoided New York and played mostly in Detroit and other midwestern towns, where drugs were then harder to come by.\n\nDespite all the personal turmoil, the 1950–54 period was actually quite fruitful for Davis artistically. He made quite a number of recordings and had several collaborations with other important musicians. He got to know the music of Chicago pianist Ahmad Jamal, whose elegant approach and use of space influenced him deeply. He also definitively severed his stylistic ties with bebop.\n\nIn 1951, Davis met Bob Weinstock, the owner of Prestige Records, and signed a contract with the label. Between 1951 and 1954, he released many records on Prestige, with several different combos. While the personnel of the recordings varied, the lineup often featured Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey. Davis was particularly fond of Rollins and tried several times, in the years that preceded his meeting with John Coltrane, to recruit him for a regular group. He never succeeded, however, mostly because Rollins was prone to make himself unavailable for months at a time. In spite of the casual occasions that generated these recordings, their quality is almost always quite high, and they document the evolution of Davis' style and sound. During this time he began using the Harmon mute, held close to the microphone, in a way that grew to be his signature, and his phrasing, especially in ballads, became spacious, melodic, and relaxed. This sound was to become so characteristic that the use of the Harmon mute by any jazz trumpet player since immediately conjures up Miles Davis.\n\nThe most important Prestige recordings of this period (Dig, Blue Haze, Bags' Groove, Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, and Walkin') originated mostly from recording sessions in 1951 and 1954, after Davis' recovery from his addiction. Also of importance are his five Blue Note recordings, collected in the Miles Davis, Volume 1 album.\n\nWith these recordings, Davis assumed a central position in what is known as hard bop. In contrast with bebop, hard bop used slower tempos and a less radical approach to harmony and melody, often adopting popular tunes and standards from the American songbook as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop also distanced itself from cool jazz by virtue of a harder beat and by its constant reference to the blues, both in its traditional form and in the form made popular by rhythm and blues. A few critics go as far as to call Walkin' the album that created hard bop, but the point is debatable, given the number of musicians who were working along similar lines at the same time (and of course many of them recorded or played with Davis).\n\nAlso in this period Davis gained a reputation for being distant, cold, and withdrawn and for having a quick temper. Among the several factors that contributed to this reputation were his contempt for the critics and specialized press and some well-publicized confrontations with the public and with fellow musicians. (One occasion, in which he had a near fight with Thelonious Monk during the recording of Bags' Groove, received wide exposure in the specialized press.)\n\nThe \"nocturnal\" quality of Davis' playing and his somber reputation, along with his whispering voice, earned him the lasting moniker of \"prince of darkness\", adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.\n\nBack in New York and in better health, in 1955 Davis attended the Newport Jazz Festival, where his performance (and especially his solo on \"'Round Midnight\") was greatly admired and prompted the critics to hail the \"return of Miles Davis\". At the same time, Davis recruited the players for a formation that became known as his \"first great quintet\": John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.\n\nNone of these musicians, with the exception of Davis, had received a great deal of exposure before that time; Chambers, in particular, was very young (19 at the time), a Detroit player who had been on the New York scene for only about a year, working with the bands of Bennie Green, Paul Quinichette, George Wallington, J. J. Johnson, and Kai Winding. Coltrane was little known at the time, in spite of earlier collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges. Davis hired Coltrane as a replacement for Sonny Rollins, after unsuccessfully trying to recruit Cannonball Adderley.\n\nThe repertoire included many bebop mainstays, standards from the Great American Songbook and the pre-bop era, and some traditional tunes. The prevailing style of the group was a development of the Davis experience in the previous years—Davis playing long, legato, and essentially melodic lines, while Coltrane, who during these years emerged as a leading figure on the musical scene, contrasted by playing high-energy solos.\n\nWith the new formation also came a new recording contract. In Newport, Davis had met Columbia Records producer George Avakian, who persuaded him to sign with his label. The quintet made its debut on record with the extremely well received 'Round About Midnight. Before leaving Prestige, however, Davis had to fulfill his obligations during two days of recording sessions in 1956. Prestige released these recordings in the following years as four albums: Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, and Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet. While the recording took place in a studio, each record of this series has the structure and feel of a live performance, with several first takes on each album. The records became almost instant classics and were instrumental in establishing Davis' quintet as one of the best on the jazz scene.\n\nThe quintet was disbanded for the first time in 1957, following a series of personal problems that Davis blames on the drug addiction of the other musicians. Davis played some gigs at the Cafe Bohemia with a short-lived formation that included Sonny Rollins and drummer Art Taylor, and then traveled to France, where he recorded the score to Louis Malle's film Ascenseur pour l'échafaud. With the aid of French session musicians Barney Wilen, Pierre Michelot, and René Urtreger, and American drummer Kenny Clarke, he recorded the entire soundtrack with an innovative procedure, without relying on written material: starting from sparse indication of the harmony and a general feel of a given piece, the group played by watching the movie on a screen in front of them and improvising.\n\nReturning to New York in 1958, Davis recruited alto saxophonist Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley. Coltrane, who in the meantime had freed himself from his drug habits, was available after a highly fruitful experience with Thelonious Monk and was hired back, as was Philly Joe Jones. With the quintet re-formed as a sextet, Davis recorded Milestones, an album anticipating the new directions he was preparing to give to his music.\n\nAlmost immediately after the recording of Milestones, Davis fired Garland and, shortly afterward, Jones, again for behavioral problems; he replaced them with Bill Evans—a young white pianist with a strong classical background—and drummer Jimmy Cobb. With this revamped formation, Davis began a year during which the sextet performed and toured extensively and produced a record (1958 Miles, also known as 58 Sessions). Evans had a unique, impressionistic approach to the piano, and his musical ideas had a strong influence on Davis. But after only eight months on the road with the group, he was burned out and left. He was soon replaced by Wynton Kelly, a player who brought to the sextet a swinging, bluesy approach that contrasted with Evans' more delicate playing.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with Gil Evans, often playing flugelhorn as well as trumpet. The first, Miles Ahead (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz big band and a horn section arranged by Evans. Songs included Dave Brubeck's \"The Duke,\" as well as Léo Delibes's \"The Maids of Cadiz,\" the first piece of European classical music Davis had recorded. Another distinctive feature of the album was the orchestral passages that Evans had devised as transitions between the different tracks, which were joined together with the innovative use of editing in the post-production phase, turning each side of the album into a seamless piece of music.\n\nIn 1958, Davis and Evans were back in the studio to record Porgy and Bess, an arrangement of pieces from George Gershwin's opera of the same name. The lineup included three members of the sextet: Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones, and Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley. Davis called the album one of his favorites.\n\nSketches of Spain (1959–1960) featured songs by contemporary Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo and also Manuel de Falla, as well as Gil Evans originals with a Spanish flavor. Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall (1961) includes Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez, along with other compositions recorded in concert with an orchestra under Evans' direction.\n\nSessions with Davis and Evans in 1962 resulted in the album Quiet Nights, a short collection of bossa novas that was released against the wishes of both artists: Evans stated it was only half an album, and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer Teo Macero, whom he didn't speak to for more than two years. This was the last time Evans and Davis made a full album together; despite the professional separation, however, Davis noted later that \"my best friend is Gil Evans.\"\n\nIn March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet to record what is widely considered his magnum opus, Kind of Blue. He called back Bill Evans, months away from forming what would become his own seminal trio, for the album sessions, as the music had been planned around Evans' piano style. Both Davis and Evans were personally acquainted with the ideas of pianist George Russell regarding modal jazz, Davis from discussions with Russell and others before the Birth of the Cool sessions, and Evans from study with Russell in 1956. Davis, however, had neglected to inform current pianist Kelly of Evans' role in the recordings; Kelly subsequently played only on the track \"Freddie Freeloader\" and was not present at the April dates for the album. \"So What\" and \"All Blues\" had been played by the sextet at performances prior to the recording sessions, but for the other three compositions, Davis and Evans prepared skeletal harmonic frameworks that the other musicians saw for the first time on the day of recording, to allow a fresher approach to their improvisations. The resulting album has proven to be both highly popular and enormously influential. According to the RIAA, Kind of Blue is the best-selling jazz album of all time, having been certified as quadruple platinum (4 million copies sold). In December 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution honoring the album as a national treasure.\n\nThe trumpet Davis used on the recording is currently displayed in the music building on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was donated to the school by Arthur \"Buddy\" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the \"Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program.\"\n\nLater in 1959, while taking a break outside the famous Birdland nightclub in New York City, Davis along with others were told by a police officer to clear the side walk and subsequently didn't. The officer said that he would arrest Miles and reached for his cuffs when Miles leaned toward him (boxing style), the police officer fell backward with his cuffs falling. Seconds later a detective came up behind Miles and hit him on the head with a baton resulting in blood getting on his suit. Miles was then arrested, where in the station police harassed him by bumping into him on purpose. Davis attempted to pursue the case in the courts, before eventually dropping the proceedings in a plea bargain in order to recover his suspended Cabaret Card, enabling him to return to work in New York clubs.\n\nDavis persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on Davis' 1961 album Someday My Prince Will Come. After Coltrane, Davis tried various saxophonists, including Jimmy Heath, Sonny Stitt, and Hank Mobley. The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at Carnegie Hall and the Black Hawk jazz club in San Francisco. Stitt's playing with the group is found on a recording made in Olympia, Paris (where Davis and Coltrane had played a few months before) and the Live in Stockholm album.\n\nIn 1963, Davis' longtime rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb departed. He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including tenor saxophonist George Coleman and bassist Ron Carter. Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half the tracks for an album in the spring of 1963. A few weeks later, seventeen-year-old drummer Tony Williams and pianist Herbie Hancock joined the group, and soon afterward Davis, Coleman, and the new rhythm section recorded the rest of Seven Steps to Heaven.\n\nThe rhythm players melded together quickly as a section and with the horns. The group's rapid evolution can be traced through the Seven Steps to Heaven album, In Europe (July 1963), My Funny Valentine (February 1964), and Four and More (also February 1964). The quintet played essentially the same repertoire of bebop tunes and standards that earlier Davis bands had played, but they tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and, in the case of the up-tempo material, breakneck speed.\n\nColeman left in the spring of 1964, to be replaced by avant-garde saxophonist Sam Rivers, on the suggestion of Tony Williams. Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in Japan; this configuration can be heard on Miles in Tokyo! (July 1964).\n\nBy the end of the summer, Davis had persuaded Wayne Shorter to leave Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and join the quintet. Shorter became the group's principal composer, and some of his compositions of this era (including \"Footprints\" and \"Nefertiti\") have become standards. While on tour in Europe, the group quickly made their first official recording, Miles in Berlin (September 1964). On returning to the United States later that year, ever the musical entrepreneur, Davis (at Jackie DeShannon's urging) was instrumental in getting The Byrds signed to Columbia Records.\n\nBy the time of E.S.P. (1965), Davis' lineup consisted of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter (bass), and Tony Williams (drums). The last of his acoustic bands, this group is often referred to as \"the second great quintet.\"\n\nA two-night Chicago performance in late 1965 is captured on The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965, released in 1995. Unlike their studio albums, the live engagement shows the group still playing primarily standards and bebop tunes. It is reasonable to point out though, that whilst some of the titles remain the same as the tunes employed by the 1950s quintet, the speed and distance of departure from the framework of the standards bears no comparison. It could even be said that the listening experience to these standards as live performances is as much of a radical take on the jazz of the time as the new compositions of the studio albums listed below.\n\nThe recording of Live at the Plugged Nickel was not issued anywhere in the 1960s, first appearing as a Japan-only partial issue in the late 1970s, then as a double-LP in the USA and Europe in 1982. It was followed by a series of studio recordings: Miles Smiles (1966), Sorcerer (1967), Nefertiti (1967), Miles in the Sky (1968), and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1968). The quintet's approach to improvisation came to be known as \"time no changes\" or \"freebop,\" because they abandoned the more conventional chord-change-based approach of bebop for a modal approach. Through Nefertiti, the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their live concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation. Davis's bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975.\n\nMiles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro, on which electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar were tentatively introduced on some tracks, pointed the way to the subsequent fusion phase of Davis' career. Davis also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of Filles de Kilimanjaro had been recorded, bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea had replaced Carter and Hancock in the working band, though both Carter and Hancock would occasionally contribute to future recording sessions. Davis soon began to take over the compositional duties of his sidemen.\n\nDavis' influences included late-1960s acid rock and funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix, many of whom he met through Betty Mabry (later Betty Davis), a young model and songwriter Davis married in September 1968 and divorced a year later. The musical transition required that Davis and his band adapt to electric instruments in both live performances and the studio.\n\nBy the time In a Silent Way had been recorded in February 1969, Davis had augmented his quintet with additional players. At various times Hancock or Joe Zawinul was brought in to join Corea on electric keyboards, and guitarist John McLaughlin made the first of his many appearances with Davis. By this point, Shorter was also doubling on soprano saxophone. After recording this album, Williams left to form his group Lifetime and was replaced by Jack DeJohnette.\n\nSix months later an even larger group of musicians, including Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and Bennie Maupin, recorded the double LP Bitches Brew, which became a huge seller, reaching gold status by 1976. This album and In a Silent Way were among the first fusions of jazz and rock that were commercially successful, building on the groundwork laid by Charles Lloyd, Larry Coryell, and others who pioneered a genre that would become known as \"jazz-rock fusion\".\n\nDuring this period, Davis toured with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette. The group's repertoire included material from Bitches Brew, In a Silent Way, and the 1960s quintet albums, along with an occasional standard.\n\nIn 1972, Davis was introduced to the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen by Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote that \"the effect of Davis' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. . . . Davis' own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally.\" His recordings and performances during this period were described as \"space music\" by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster, who described it as \"a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music.\"\n\nBoth Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way feature \"extended\" (more than 20 minutes each) compositions that were never actually \"played straight through\" by the musicians in the studio. Instead, Davis and producer Teo Macero selected musical motifs of various lengths from recorded extended improvisations and edited them together into a musical whole that exists only in the recorded version. Bitches Brew made use of such electronic effects as multi-tracking, tape loops, and other editing techniques. Both records, especially Bitches Brew, proved to be big sellers.\n\nStarting with Bitches Brew, Davis' albums began to often feature cover art much more in line with psychedelic art or black power movements than that of his earlier albums. He took significant cuts in his usual performing fees in order to open for rock groups like the Steve Miller Band, the Grateful Dead, and Santana. Several live albums were recorded during the early 1970s at these performances: Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970) - It's About That Time, Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West, and Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East.\n\nBy the time of Live-Evil in December 1970, Davis' ensemble had transformed into a much more funk-oriented group. Davis began experimenting with wah-wah effects on his horn. The ensemble with Gary Bartz, Keith Jarrett, and Michael Henderson, often referred to as the \"Cellar Door band\" (the live portions of Live-Evil were recorded at a Washington, DC, club by that name), never recorded in the studio, but is documented in the six-CD box set The Cellar Door Sessions 1970, which was recorded over four nights in December 1970.\n\nIn 1970, Davis contributed extensively to the soundtrack of a documentary about the African-American boxer heavyweight champion Jack Johnson. Himself a devotee of boxing, Davis drew parallels between Johnson, whose career had been defined by the fruitless search for a Great White Hope to dethrone him, and Davis' own career, in which he felt the musical establishment of the time had prevented him from receiving the acclaim and rewards that were due him. The resulting album, 1971's A Tribute to Jack Johnson, contained two long pieces that featured musicians (some of whom were not credited on the record) including guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, Herbie Hancock on a Farfisa organ, and drummer Billy Cobham. McLaughlin and Cobham went on to become founding members of the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1971.\n\nAs Davis stated in his autobiography, he wanted to make music for the young African-American audience. On the Corner (1972) blended funk elements with the traditional jazz styles he had played his entire career. The album was highlighted by the appearance of saxophonist Carlos Garnett. Critics were not kind to the album; in his autobiography, Davis stated that critics could not figure out how to categorize it, and he complained that the album was not promoted by the \"traditional\" jazz radio stations.\n\nAfter recording On the Corner, Davis put together a new group, with only Michael Henderson, Carlos Garnett, and percussionist Mtume returning from the previous band. It included guitarist Reggie Lucas, tabla player Badal Roy, sitarist Khalil Balakrishna, and drummer Al Foster. It was unusual in that none of the sidemen were major jazz instrumentalists; as a result, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of individual solos. This group, which recorded in the Philharmonic Hall for the album In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall (1972), was unsatisfactory to Davis. Through the first half of 1973, he dropped the tabla and sitar, took over keyboard duties, and added guitarist Pete Cosey. The Davis/Cosey/Lucas/Henderson/Mtume/Foster ensemble would remain virtually intact over the next two years. Initially, Dave Liebman played saxophones and flute with the band; in 1974, he was replaced by Sonny Fortune.\n\nBig Fun (1974) was a double album containing four long improvisations, recorded between 1969 and 1972. Similarly, Get Up With It (1974) collected recordings from the previous five years. Get Up With It included \"He Loved Him Madly\", a tribute to Duke Ellington, as well as one of Davis' most lauded pieces from this era, \"Calypso Frelimo\". It was his last studio album of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: Dark Magus, Agharta, and Pangaea. Dark Magus captures a 1974 New York concert; the latter two are recordings of consecutive concerts from the same February 1975 day in Osaka. At the time, only Agharta was available in the US; Pangaea and Dark Magus were initially released only by CBS/Sony Japan. All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of Hendrix-inspired electronic distortion devices; Dominique Gaumont is a third guitarist on Dark Magus), electric bass, drums, reeds, and Davis on electric trumpet and organ. These albums were the last he was to record for five years. Davis was troubled by osteoarthritis (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, ulcers, and a renewed dependence on alcohol and drugs (primarily cocaine), and his performances were routinely panned by critics throughout late 1974 and early 1975. By the time the group reached Japan in February 1975, Davis was nearing a physical breakdown and required copious amounts of alcohol and narcotics to make it through his engagements. Nonetheless, as noted by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, during these concerts his trumpet playing \"is of the highest and most adventurous order.\"\n\nAfter a Newport Jazz Festival performance at Avery Fisher Hall in New York on July 1, 1975, Davis withdrew almost completely from the public eye for six years. As Gil Evans said, \"His organism is tired. And after all the music he's contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest.\"\n\nDavis characterized this period in his memoirs as a colorful time when wealthy women lavished him with sex and drugs. In reality, he had become completely dependent on various drugs, spending nearly all of his time propped up on a couch in his apartment watching television, leaving only to find more drugs. In 1976, Rolling Stone reported rumors of his imminent demise. Although he stopped practicing trumpet on a regular basis, Davis continued to compose intermittently and made three attempts at recording during his exile from performing; these sessions (one with the assistance of Paul Buckmaster and Gil Evans, who left after not receiving promised compensation) bore little fruit and remain unreleased.\n\nIn 1979, he placed in the yearly top-ten trumpeter poll of Down Beat. Columbia continued to issue compilation albums and records of unreleased vault material to fulfill contractual obligations.\n\nDuring his period of inactivity, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade enter into the mainstream. When he emerged from retirement, Davis' musical descendants would be in the realm of New Wave rock, and in particular the styling of Prince.\n\nBy 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress Cicely Tyson. With Tyson, Davis would overcome his cocaine addiction and regain his enthusiasm for music. As he had not played trumpet for the better part of three years, regaining his famed embouchure proved to be particularly arduous. While recording The Man with the Horn (sessions were spread sporadically over 1979–1981), Davis played mostly wahwah with a younger, larger band.\n\nThe initial large band was eventually abandoned in favor of a smaller combo featuring saxophonist Bill Evans and bass player Marcus Miller, both of whom would be among Davis' most regular collaborators throughout the decade. He married Tyson in 1981; they would divorce in 1988. The Man with the Horn was finally released in 1981 and received a poor critical reception despite selling fairly well. In May, the new band played two dates as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. The concerts, as well as the live recording We Want Miles from the ensuing tour, received positive reviews.\n\nBy late 1982, Davis' band included French percussionist Mino Cinelu and guitarist John Scofield, with whom he worked closely on the album Star People. In mid-1983, while working on the tracks for Decoy, an album mixing soul music and electronica that was released in 1984, Davis brought in producer, composer and keyboardist Robert Irving III, who had earlier collaborated with him on The Man with the Horn. With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, keyboardist and music director Irving, drummer Al Foster and bassist Darryl Jones (later of The Rolling Stones), Davis played a series of European gigs to positive receptions. While in Europe, he took part in the recording of Aura, an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. You're Under Arrest, Davis' next album, was released in 1985 and included another brief stylistic detour. Included on the album were his interpretations of Cyndi Lauper's ballad \"Time After Time,\" and \"Human Nature\" from Michael Jackson. Davis considered releasing an entire album of pop songs and recorded dozens of them, but the idea was scrapped. Davis noted that many of today's accepted jazz standards were in fact pop songs from Broadway theater, and that he was simply updating the \"standards\" repertoire with new material.\n\nYou're Under Arrest also proved to be Davis' final album for Columbia. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis publicly dismissed Davis' more recent fusion recordings as not being \"'true' jazz\", comments Davis initially shrugged off, calling Marsalis \"a nice young man, only confused\". This changed after Marsalis appeared, unannounced, onstage in the midst of a Davis performance. Marsalis whispered into Davis' ear that \"someone\" had told him to do so; Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.\n\nDavis grew irritated at Columbia's delay releasing Aura. The breaking point in the label-artist relationship appears to have come when a Columbia jazz producer requested Davis place a goodwill birthday call to Marsalis. Davis signed with Warner Brothers shortly thereafter.\n\nDavis collaborated with a number of figures from the British new wave movement during this period, including Scritti Politti. At the invitation of producer Bill Laswell, Davis recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd's Album, according to Public Image's John Lydon in the liner notes of their Plastic Box box set. In Lydon's words, however, \"strangely enough, we didn't use (his contributions).\" (Also according to Lydon in the Plastic Box notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon's singing voice to his trumpet sound.)\n\nHaving first taken part in the Artists United Against Apartheid recording, Davis signed with Warner Brothers records and reunited with Marcus Miller. The resulting record, Tutu (1986), would be his first to use modern studio tools — programmed synthesizers, samples and drum loops — to create an entirely new setting for Davis' playing. Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as the modern counterpart of Sketches of Spain and won a Grammy in 1987.\n\nHe followed Tutu with Amandla, another collaboration with Miller and George Duke, plus the soundtracks to four movies: Street Smart, Siesta, The Hot Spot, and Dingo. He continued to tour with a band of constantly rotating personnel and a critical stock at a level higher than it had been for 15 years. His last recordings, both released posthumously, were the hip hop-influenced studio album Doo-Bop and Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux, a collaboration with Quincy Jones for the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival in which Davis performed the repertoire from his 1940s and 1950s recordings for the first time in decades.\n\nIn 1988 he had a small part as a street musician in the film Scrooged, starring Bill Murray. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In 1989, Miles was interviewed on the television show '60 minutes' by Harry Reasoner.\n\nIn early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film Dingo as a jazz musician. In the film's opening sequence, Davis and his band unexpectedly land on a remote airstrip in the Australian outback and proceed to perform for the stunned locals. The performance was one of Davis' last on film.\n\nMiles Davis died on September 28, 1991 from a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure in Santa Monica, California at the age of 65. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.\n\nMiles Davis is regarded as one of the most innovative, influential and respected figures in the history of jazz music. He has been described as “one of the great innovators in jazz”. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll noted \"Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style - in attitude and fashion - as well as music\". His album Kind of Blue is the best-selling album in the history of jazz music and was praised by the United States House of Representatives to \"pass a symbolic resolution honoring the masterpiece and reaffirming jazz as a national treasure.\"\n\nAs an innovative bandleader and composer, Miles Davis has influenced many notable musicians and bands from diverse genres. These include Wayne Shorter, Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Hancock, Lalo Schifrin, Tangerine Dream, Brand X, Mtume, Benny Bailey, Joe Bonner, Don Cherry, Urszula Dudziak, Bill Evans, Bill Hardman, The Lounge Lizards, Hugh Masekela , John McLaughlin, King Crimson, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa, Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, Lydia Lunch, Talk Talk, Michael Franks, Sting, Lonnie Liston Smith, Jiří Stivín, Tim Hagans, Julie Christensen, Vassar Clements, Snooky Young, Prince and Christian Scott.\n\nMiles' influence on the people who played with him has been described by music writer and author Christopher Smith as follows:\n\nMiles Davis' artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary. [...] Miles' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.\n\nHis approach, owing largely to the African American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.\n\nIn 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Miles Davis an Honorary Doctorate for his extraordinary contributions to music. Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) has honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

September 1991 in Santa Monica, Kalifornien) war ein amerikanischer Jazz-Trompeter, -Flügelhornist, Komponist und Bandleader und einer der einflussreichsten Jazzmusiker des 20. Jh. Nachdem er an der sogenannten Bebop-Revolution teilgenommen hatte, beeinflusste Davis maßgeblich die Entwicklung unterschiedlicher Jazz-Stile wie Cool Jazz, Hard Bop, modalen Jazz und Jazzrock. Sowohl als Instrumentalist wie auch als kreativer Geist gelang es Miles Davis, seine eigenen künstlerischen Ideen zu verwirklichen und gleichzeitig kommerziell erfolgreich zu sein.\n\nErste Berühmtheit erlangte Miles Davis als Bebop-Jazzer und Sideman von Charlie Parker. In den 46 Jahren seines musikalischen Schaffens arbeitete er mit Musikern wie John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul, John McLaughlin und Gil Evans zusammen. Da er regelmäßig talentierte Musiker, von denen er neue Impulse erwartete, in seine Band holte und ihnen Raum zur Entfaltung gab, verdanken zahlreiche Jazz-Größen ihren Durchbruch als Musiker der Zusammenarbeit mit Davis.\n\nSeit Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts erfahren seine Alben und Kompositionen große Anerkennung bei Musikkritikern und Fans gleichermaßen. Sie gelten als Klassiker und Meisterwerke des Jazz. Davis selbst wurde u. a. zum besten Trompetenspieler gekürt. Als besondere Würdigung des Werks von Miles Davis verabschiedete das Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten am 15. Dezember 2009 eine symbolische Resolution anlässlich des 50. Jahrestags der Aufnahme seines Albums Kind of Blue zur „Ehrung des Meisterwerks und zur Bekräftigung, dass Jazz ein nationales Kulturgut ist“.\n(Wikipedia)",

      "biography_fr": "Miles Dewey Davis III (26 mai 1926, Alton, Illinois - 28 septembre 1991, Santa Monica, Californie) est un compositeur et trompettiste de jazz américain.\n\nMiles Davis commence à jouer de la trompette à l'âge de douze ans. Il fut à la pointe de beaucoup d'évolutions dans le jazz et s'est particulièrement distingué par sa capacité à découvrir et à s'entourer de nouveaux talents. Son jeu se caractérise par une grande sensibilité musicale et par la fragilité qu'il arrive à donner au son. Il marque l'histoire du jazz et de la musique du XXe siècle. Beaucoup de grands noms du jazz des années 1940 à 1980 travaillent avec lui.\n\nLes différentes formations de Miles Davis sont comme des laboratoires au sein desquels se sont révélés les talents de nouvelles générations et les nouveaux horizons de la musique moderne ; notamment Sonny Rollins, Julian « Cannonball » Adderley, Bill Evans et John Coltrane durant les années 1950. De 1960 aux années 1980 ses sidemen se nomment Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, George Coleman, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, Tony Williams, Joe Zawinul, Dave Liebman et Kenny Garrett ; c'est avec eux qu'il s'oriente vers la « fusion » du rock et du jazz, dont il reste l'un des pionniers. La découverte de la musique de Jimi Hendrix est déterminante dans cette évolution, mais surtout le choc du festival de Newport, en 1969, où l'on assiste à l'origine exclusivement à des concerts de jazz, mais qui, cette année-là, programme du rock. Nombre de musiciens qui passent par ses formations de 1963 à 1969 forment ensuite les groupes emblématiques du jazz-rock fusion, notamment Weather Report, animé par Wayne Shorter et Joe Zawinul, Mahavishnu Orchestra de John McLaughlin, Return to Forever de Chick Corea, ainsi que les différents groupes de Herbie Hancock.\n\nMiles Davis est un des rares jazzmen et l'un des premiers musiciens noirs à s'être fait connaître et accepter par l'Amérique moyenne, remportant même le trophée de l'homme le mieux habillé de l'année du mensuel GQ pendant les années 1960. Comme Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis est ce phénomène curieux, une superstar du jazz. À la différence de son glorieux aîné qui avait recherché l'intégration à la culture grand public dominée par la population blanche, le parcours musical de Miles Davis s'accompagne d'une prise de position politique en faveur de la cause noire et de sa lutte contre le racisme, menée avec la colère permanente d'un homme au caractère réputé ombrageux. En 1985, il participe à l'album Sun City contre l'apartheid à l'initiative de Steven van Zandt.\n\nEn France, c'est l'enregistrement de la musique du film Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (1957) de Louis Malle qui le rend célèbre. Son dernier album, Doo-bop, paru en 1992 après sa mort, laisse éclater des influences rap.",

      "biography_nl": "Miles Dewey Davis III (Alton (Illinois), 26 mei 1926 – Santa Monica (Californië), 28 september 1991) was een Amerikaans jazzcomponist, trompettist en multi-instrumentalist. Hij wordt door verschillende deskundigen beschouwd als één van de meest invloedrijke, vernieuwende en originele muzikanten van de twintigste eeuw.\n\nDavis speelde naast onder anderen Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington en John Coltrane een grote rol in de geschiedenis van de jazz. Hij speelde verschillende stijlen, waaronder bop, cool jazz, modale jazz en jazzrockfusion. Miles was een spil in de ontwikkeling van de laatstgenoemde drie stijlen. Als gevolg hiervan wordt Miles the Picasso of jazz genoemd.\n\nDe stijl van Davis is herkenbaar en origineel en oefent tot op decennia na zijn overlijden invloed uit op jazzmusici. Op een deel van zijn opnames gebruikte Davis een harmon mute, een type demper waarmee hij het typische timbre creëerde dat tijdens de rest van zijn carrière direct met hem geassocieerd bleef worden. Ook zijn klank en speelstijl zonder de mute is herkenbaar, onder meer door de typische afbuigingen aan het begin of eind van de tonen en de ingehouden lyrische speelstijl met lange stiltes tussen de melodische frasen.\n\nIn 1945, nadat hij zijn middelbare school had afgerond en een korte tijd met Charlie Parker in Billy Ecksteins band speelde, verhuisde Davis naar New York, ogenschijnlijk om met een beurs aan de Juilliard School of Music te studeren. In werkelijkheid verwaarloosde hij zijn opleiding en ging hij op zoek naar zijn helden, zoals Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk en Coleman Hawkins. Tevens ging hij geregeld op pad met één van zijn andere idolen, Dizzy Gillespie. Zij werden goede vrienden.\n\nDavis schreef over zijn helden samen met Quincy Troupe in zijn autobiografie Miles: \"When I heard Diz and Bird in B's band, I said, \"What? What is this!?\" Man, that shit was so terrible that it was scary. I mean, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker, Buddy Anderson, Gene Amons, Lucky Thompson an Art Blakey all together in one band and not to mention B: Billy Eckstine himself. It was a motherfucker. Man, that shit was all up in my body. Music all up in my body, and that's what I wanted to hear.\"\n\nTegen 1949 had hij aan zijn 'proeftijd' als medespeler voldaan, zowel op het podium als op plaatopnames. Zijn eigen opnamecarrière bloeide vervolgens op. In datzelfde jaar begon Davis samen te werken met Gil Evans. Deze samenwerking bleef de volgende twintig jaar voor veel van zijn grote werken bestaan. De platen die zij in de late jaren veertig maakten, werden de eerste tien jaar beperkt gepubliceerd.\n\nVia de jazzclubs van New York kwam Davis regelmatig in contact met zowel gebruikers als verkopers van illegale drugs. Tegen 1950 had hij een serieuze heroïneverslaving, mogelijk verergerd door de weinig enthousiaste ontvangst van zijn eerste persoonlijke opnames.\n\nIn het eerste deel van de jaren vijftig leek het talent dat Davis bezat verloren te gaan. Hij speelde verscheidene sessies (gigs), maar deze waren ongeïnspireerd. Davis was zich hiervan bewust en keerde in 1954 terug naar East Saint Louis, waar hij met hulp van zijn vader probeerde af te kicken. Die dacht onterecht dat het met zijn gebit te maken had. Davis sloot zich letterlijk van de maatschappij af tot hij vrij van zijn drugsverslaving zou zijn. Hoewel hij later beweerde dat hij sindsdien geen drugs meer gebruikte, schijnt hij in werkelijkheid verslaafd te zijn gebleven.\n\nAls herboren keerde hij terug naar New York en richtte er de eerste grote versie van het Miles Davis Quintet op. In deze band speelden de jonge John Coltrane (oorspronkelijk enkel tenor- en later ook sopraansaxofoon) en soms enkele andere indertijd bekende jazzartiesten, zoals Sonny Rollins (tenorsax) en Charles Mingus (bas).\n\nMuzikaal ging de groep door waar Davis in zijn sessies in de late jaren veertig ophield. Ze vermeden de ritmische en harmonische complexiteit van de overheersende bebop en Davis kreeg de ruimte om lange, legato en in wezen melodische lijnen te spelen, waarin hij de modale muziek leerde doorgronden. Dit was een levenslange obsessie voor hem.\n\nDeze opnames, beginnend met Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet, bepaalden samen met de 'Birth of the Cool'-opnames uit 1948 het geluid van de cool jazz, een van de dominante trends in de muziek voor het komende decennium en later.\n\nTerwijl de rest van het muziekestablishment nog steeds probeerde de vernieuwingen van Davis te accepteren, was hij zelf verder. Herenigd met Gil Evans nam hij een serie albums van grote verscheidenheid en complexiteit op, waarin hij in vrijwel elke muzikale context zijn beheersing van zijn instrument toonde.\n\nOp het eerste album, Miles Ahead (1957), speelde hij met een traditionele jazzbigband. Deze had een gedreven kopersectie gearrangeerd door Gil Evans. Naast jazznummers (waaronder The Duke van Dave Brubeck) gingen de twee het gevecht aan met Les Filles de Cadix van Léo Delibes. Dit was de eerste keer dat Davis Europese klassieke muziek opnam.\n\nMilestones 1958 ving het geluid van zijn huidige sextet, dat nu bestond uit Davis, John Coltrane, Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley (altsax), Red Garland (piano), Paul Chambers (bas) en Philly Joe Jones (drums).\n\nMuzikaal gezien omvatte dit album zowel het verleden als de toekomst van de jazz. Davis liet zien dat hij blues en bebop kon spelen (begeleid door Garland), maar het centerpiece is het titelnummer, een compositie van Davis rond de dorische en aeolische modi en met de vrije improvisionele modale stijl die Davis zich eigen maakte.\n\nDeze modale stijl kwam tot bloei op Kind of Blue (1959) en werd de best verkochte jazzplaat uit de geschiedenis tot dan toe. Het sextet improviseerde op korte modale thema’s die vooraf niet waren geoefend. In de groep nam Bill Evans de piano over en hij zorgde daarbij voor klassieke invloeden in de groep. Op één van de tracks speelde Wynton Kelly piano. Hij werd later een vast lid van de groep.\n\nNa Kind of Blue viel de groep uiteen. Coltrane, Evans en Adderley gingen verder als bandleiders. Miles vond minder inspiratie en zijn groep veranderde geregeld van bezetting. In 1964 vormde hij zijn tweede grote kwintet. Herbie Hancock op piano, Wayne Shorter op saxofoon, Ron Carter op bas en de nog jonge Tony Williams op drums. Davis stelde: \"Je moet eerst de regels kennen om ze vervolgens te kunnen breken.\" Live werden jazzstandards gespeeld waarbij de grenzen van de traditie werden opgezocht. Lange improvisaties met veel nadruk op harmonische grenzen en een hecht groepsspel, waardoor hij meer dan daarvoor met textuur kon spelen. Live speelde hij standards en in de studio nieuw werk, vooral composities van zijn saxofonist Wayne Shorter. De grenzen werden bereikt op Live at Plugged Nickel (uitgegeven als 8cd box). Het vormde een tegenstem voor de freejazz van Ornette Coleman, die Davis in zijn autobiografie verguisde.\n\nn juni 1970 kwamen onder anderen Davis, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette en John McLaughlin vier nachten samen in de bescheiden nachtclub The Cellar Door in Washington D.C. Van die optredens kwam in 2006 een 6-cd-box uit.\n\nAan het eind van de jaren zestig 'ging' Davis elektrisch met een elektrische piano, elektrische bas en een elektrische gitaar. De 'groove' werd belangrijk. Nadat Davis op het Isle of Wight Festival Machine Gun van Jimi Hendrix hoorde wilde Davis direct een band met hem beginnen. \"It's that goddamned motherfucking 'Machine Gun.'\" antwoordde Miles op een vraag wat hij vond van de muziek van Hendrix. Door het het overlijden van Hendrix vond die nooit plaats. Volgens Rolling Stone magazine was \"In a Silent Way de ideale plaat om stoned op te worden\". In de jaren zeventig probeerde hij ook zwarte jongeren te bereiken door funk-invloeden in zijn muziek te stoppen. Bitches Brew werd een mijlpaal voor de opkomende jazz-fusion muziek.\n\nEind 1975 trok Davis zich terug uit de muziek en wilde hij geen trompet meer spelen. Hij kampte met een slechte gezondheid, gedeeltelijk veroorzaakt door jaren overmatig drugsgebruik.\n\nDavis keerde toch terug in de muziek. Zijn stijl veranderde meer naar een popstijl. Hij speelde liedjes als Time After Time en Human Nature (van Michael Jackson). Verschillende van de musici met wie hij speelde, verkasten één voor één naar Sting, die op You're under arrest een politieman speelde. In deze stijl speelde hij tot aan zijn dood. Hij verwierf ook als beeldend kunstenaar bekendheid. Eén van zijn vaste muzikale partners werd Marcus Miller.\n\nHij ondernam nog een paar projecten:\n\n1) Met Quincy Jones keerde hij voor het eerst terug naar de muziek die hij vroeger speelde met Gil Evans.\n2) Aura, dat de platenmaatschappij jarenlang 'op de plank' liet liggen.\n3)Hij speelde op uitnodiging van Prince een concert in diens studiocomplex Paisley Park in Minneapolis.\n\nDe Franse beeldhouwster Niki de Saint Phalle vereeuwigde Davis in een beeld, dat de tuin siert van het belle époque-hotel Negresco aan de Promenade des Anglais in Nice. Tevens staat er een beeld van hem in de Poolse plaats Kielce (zie foto).\n\nDavis scheidde in 1988 van actrice Cicely Tyson, per november 1981 zijn derde en laatste echtgenote. Eerder was hij getrouwd met Frances Taylor (1958-1968) en met Betty Mabry (1968-1969). Davis kreeg vier kinderen, Cheryl (1944), Gregory, (1946), Miles IV (1950) en Erin (1970).\n",
      "biography_pt": "Miles Dewey Davis Jr (Alton, 26 de maio de 1926 – Santa Mônica, 28 de Setembro de 1991) foi um trompetista, compositor e bandleader de jazz norte-americano.\n\nConsiderado um dos mais influentes músicos do século XX, Davis esteve na vanguarda de quase todos os desenvolvimentos do jazz desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial até a década de 1990. Ele participou de várias gravações do bebop e das primeiras gravações do cool jazz. Foi parte do desenvolvimento do jazz modal, e também do jazz fusion que originou-se do trabalho dele com outros músicos no final da década de 1960 e no começo da década de 1970.\n\nMiles Davis pertenceu a uma classe tradicional de trompetistas de jazz, que começou com Buddy Bolden e desenvolveu-se com Joe \"King\" Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Roy Eldridge e Dizzy Gillespie. Ao contrário desses músicos ele nunca foi considerado com um alto nível de habilidade técnica. Seu grande êxito como músico, entretanto, foi ir mais além do que ser influente e distinto em seu instrumento, e moldar estilos inteiros e maneiras de fazer música através dos seus trabalhos. Muitos dos mais importantes músicos de jazz fizeram seu nome na segunda metade do século XX nos grupos de Miles Davis, incluindo: Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea e Herbie Hancock, os saxofonistas John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, George Coleman e Kenny Garrett, o baterista Tony Williams e o guitarrista John McLaughlin.\n\nComo trompetista Davis tinha um som puro e claro, mas também uma incomum liberdade de articulação e altura. Ele ficou conhecido por ter um registro baixo e minimalista de tocar, mas também era capaz de conseguir alta complexidade e técnica com seu trompete.\n\nEm 13 de Março de 2006, Davis foi postumamente incluído no Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ele foi também incluído no St. Louis Walk of Fame, Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame, e no Down Beat's Jazz Hall of Fame.",
