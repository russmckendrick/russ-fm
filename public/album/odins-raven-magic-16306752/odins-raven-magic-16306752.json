      "biography": "Sigur Rós is an ambient/post-rock band from Reykjavík, Iceland, who has been active since 1994. Known for its ethereal sound, frontman Jónsi Birgisson's falsetto vocals, and the use of bowed guitar, the band's music is also noticeable for its incorporation of classical and minimalist aesthetic elements. The band was named after Jónsi's sister Sigurrós.\n\nJón Þór \"Jónsi\" Birgisson (guitar and vocals), Georg Hólm (bass) and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson (drums) formed the group in Reykjavík in August 1994. Their name is Icelandic wordplay: while the individual words Sigur and Rós mean, respectively, Victory and Rose, \"Victory Rose\" wouldn't be grammatically correct; the name is actually borrowed from Jónsi's younger sister Sigurrós, who was born the same day as the band was formed, and then split into two words. They soon won a record deal with the local Sugarcubes-owned record label, Bad Taste. In 1997, they released Von (meaning \"hope\") and in 1998 a remix collection named Von brigði . This name is also Icelandic wordplay: Vonbrigði means \"disappointment\", but Von brigði means \"variations on Von\". The band was joined by Kjartan Sveinsson on keyboards in 1998. He is the only member of Sigur Rós with musical training, and has contributed most of the orchestral and string arrangements for their later work.\n\nInternational acclaim came with 1999's Ágætis byrjun (\"An all right start\"). The album's reputation spread by word of mouth over the following two years. Soon critics worldwide hailed it as one of the great albums of its time, and the band was playing support to established acts such as Radiohead.\n In 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. All of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in Vonlenska, also known as Hopelandic, a constructed language without semantic meaning, technically glossolalia, which resembles the phonology of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.\n\nTheir fourth album, Takk... (\"Thanks...\") employs the distinctive sound of their second album in a more rock oriented structure with greater use of the guitar, and was released in September 2005.  In July 2006, Sigur Rós finished a major world tour with stops in Europe, the United States (where they played a headline show at the Hollywood Bowl), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan. Upon return to their homeland, Sigur Rós provided a series of free surprise outdoor concerts throughout Iceland in July and August, playing in various venues such as abandoned bunkers and community coffee shops, all of which were included in the 2007 documentary film Heima.\n\nVonlenska is the non-literal language that forms the unintelligible lyrics sung by the band on some songs, in particular by Jónsi. It is also commonly known by the English translation of its name, Hopelandic. It takes its name from \"Von\", a song on Sigur Rós’s debut album Von where it was first used. However, not all Sigur Rós songs are in Hopelandic; many are sung in Icelandic.",

He has worked on ambitious, experimental and original projects with various musicians, such as Psychic TV, Current 93, Sigur Rós, Steindór Andersen and Eivør Pálsdóttir. \n\nFrom 1972 to 1975 he was playing drums in a school band called Fatima with guitarist Jóhannes Helgason, bassist Birgir Ottóson and singer Guðmundur Eyjólfsson.

The band was expanded with the arrival of singers Elín Reynisdóttir, guitarist Jóhannes Helgason and drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson and with the new line-up, they created a new band called Frostrósir (Frost Roses) that played mainly disco music.\nThe band changed their name to Þeyr and released the debut album in December 1980 with the title Þagað í Hel which contained some lyrics written by Hilmar Örn.\n\nÞeyr underwent internal changes and Eiríkur left the band and guitarists Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and Þorsteinn Magnússon joined in. The music evolved dramatically with the new members and Elín and Jóhannes left the band. The new Þeyr became very famous in Iceland with Útfrymi and Mjötviður Mær, among other releases, and Hilmar Örn collaborated with them with some lyrics and art works, and also managed the band from 1981 to 1982 with Guðni Ragnar Agnarsson creating Esquimaux Management (Eskvimó, in Icelandic), an independent record label and book publisher.\nÞeyr held a deep interest in science, magic and philosophy and Hilmar Örn served as an influential figure.

After signing with FatCat Records they released their debut album, a 12-inch vinyl titled Gesundheit von K on 1 January 1999.\nWith 4 tracks, Gesundheit von K encompassed a wide range of styles: from the industrial funk of the title song to the exotic jazz of “Kastrato”. Grindverk showed with this album a dark music, with free instruments proper of the funk music or post industrialism of the eighties but in the context of the nineties.\nThey were supposed to release an album called T.h.e.r.a.p.i.s.t.s by July 1999, but it was canceled as Grindverk disbanded shortly after their debut release.\n\nHilmar Örn & Sigur Rós: In 2000 he collaborated with Sigur Rós on the soundtrack to the film Angels of the Universe, which was directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson. This seventeen-track album contained fifteen songs composed by HÖH with his mellow soothing trademark sound (classical guitars, strings and synthesizers) and two songs created by Sigur Rós (“Bíum Bíum Bambaló” and “Dánarfregnir og Jarðafarir”).

      "editorial_notes": "Sigur Rós had grand plans for the release of <i>Odin’s Raven Magic</i>. Their orchestral collaboration with fellow Icelandic musicians Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, Steindór Andersen and María Huld Markan Sigfúsdóttir premiered in 2002 at London’s Barbican Centre and was recorded live during a performance at La Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris two years later. Mixed as far back as 2006, the album was put on hold as the post-rock group discussed how best to release it. With extravagant artwork, perhaps? Or with a set of videos that would emphasise the importance of the medieval Icelandic poem they had put music to? Its legend growing over the course of 16 years, the recording has finally seen the light of day—but without any added bells or whistles. “It’s been lying around for such a long time and people have been asking if it’s going to come out, waiting for it. We decided, let’s just do a simple release, get it out,” Kjartan Sveinsson tells Apple Music.<br />\nThe former Sigur Rós keyboardist was instrumental in pulling the ambitious project together and looks back on its creation as a stressful but rewarding time. “It was fun and a bit crazy,” he says. “We were still writing music the day before rehearsals.” Written the same year that their third studio album, <i>( )</i>, brought Sigur Rós to the world’s attention, <i>Odin’s Raven Magic</i> is the sound of the band experimenting with elegant and beautiful orchestral and choral arrangements. It is too good an album to be gathering dust. “It’s a bit silly sitting on something like this, because it’s not totally bad,” says Sveinsson with huge understatement. Here, he takes us on the journey into <i>Odin’s Raven Magic</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>Prologus</b>\n“This is a piece that Hilmar wrote and delivered at the very last minute. It’s kind of a meditation to begin before the whole thing really starts. It was really good to have a bit of a prologue for the piece, because on the next one it starts with the poem. It’s good to have a little bit of foreplay.”<br />\n<b>Alföður orkar</b>\n“That is actually a theme that me and Jónsi [Birgisson, Sigur Rós singer and guitarist] had been playing with in hotel rooms on tour, a bit before we put it into <i>Odin’s Raven Magic</i>. Most of the pieces are quite simple themes that are orchestrated and maybe composed a bit, but this one was quite simple. It fitted Steindór, the chanter, really well. I think this is the only bit that we had before, the only idea that existed before. All the rest was written especially for it, very last-minute.”<br />\n<b>Dvergmál</b>\n“This is one of the themes that we wrote on the stone marimba, which was built for the performance by [artist and musician] Páll Guðmundsson. It builds around the marimba, and it’s a repeated theme. It’s fun with the stones, because they’re not really tempered, they don’t really tune with each other sonically. They’re all in tune, but sonically each stone is different from the other. So when you’re writing music on the stone marimba, you tend to go to a stone that pleases you, unconsciously in a way. Each stone is individual and kind of special. It’s really fun to experiment with that kind of stuff.”<br />\n<b>Stendur æva</b>\n“This is also based on the stone marimba theme. Then Steindór, the chanter, he wrote all these chanting melodies that he sings. He wrote all of those on top of the stone marimba themes, which I think is really well done, really beautiful. His melodies sound very ancient. We have this Icelandic special chanting style, which is sometimes rhythmically and sonically different from other folk music. He is a specialist in that field and he managed to write his own chants, new chants. Kind of new folk songs, if you will. The orchestration on that was really fun because we also had the sampler we were working [with]. Jónsi was working with it a lot. I had to orchestrate all this stuff and I think Jónsi brought it to me on a floppy disc. So, this one was kind of Jónsi’s arrangement.”<br />\n<b>Áss hinn hvíti</b>\n“‘Áss hinn hvíti’ translates as ‘the white god’, which is Heimdallr. There’s a lot of horns on this, as Heimdallr is the one who blows the horn at the end of the world. This is kind of a prologue to the Edda [two key works of ancient Norse mythology], which is about the ending, really. I think it was a very fitting little track in the middle of the piece.”<br />\n<b>Hvert stefnir</b>\n“This is based on the stone marimba again, and then Steindór’s chant. I think Steindór’s chant is really good on this one—I think it really hits the spot there with Steindór and it’s very fitting to the lyrics. It was Jónsi again with the sampler and we did the basis for the arrangement.”<br />\n<b>Spár eða spakmál</b>\n“This is based on the same chant as in ‘Stendur æva’ but with a different tonal language, so it is kind of the same song, the arrangement and tonal language accompanying the main melody. The band has never really been conceptual, but we’ve often figured out the concept after we’ve done something. Of course, this piece is conceptual but when we were working on the music, we weren’t really diving into the lyrics. We were just making music.”<br />\n<b>Dagrenning</b>\n“This is going back to the first one, with the same melody. Then it ends with chanting of Odin’s names, like a ritual. Then we do this embarrassing rock ’n’ roll thing in the end, doing rock ’n’ roll with an orchestra. We did it and we just have to live with it. I mean, we can’t exclude that from the release, can we? No. I was happy with the performance, but I was embarrassed by the rock ’n’ roll thrashing. The world is ending and we were trying to express that somehow. That didn’t go very well. But I was just glad that we survived and managed to play the whole piece, without too many hiccups.”",
