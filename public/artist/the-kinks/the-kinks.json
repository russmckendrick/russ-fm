  "biography": "The Kinks (1963–1996; 2018-present) is an English pop-rock group that came out of the British R&B scene of the early 1960s. Formed in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, by brothers Ray Davies and Dave Davies in 1964 and categorised in the United States as a \"British Invasion\" band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the original four members were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Later, in November 2005, they were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. Among numerous other honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\" in 2006. The Kinks reunited in June 2018, with the Davies brothers and drummer Mick Avory.\n\nFormed in 1963 in Muswell Hill, North London, they first gained prominence on the heels of the well-received and highly influential single \"You Really Got Me\" (1964). The group originally consisted of lead singer/guitarist Ray Davies, his brother lead guitarist Dave Davies, drummer Mick Avory, and bassist Pete Quaife.  Quaife left (twice) in the late 1960s, and Avory finally left in 1984 as the result of a long-running dispute with Dave Davies, leaving only the Davies brothers as the core of the original group.\n\nWith Ray Davies' songwriting skills and unabashedly English voices, Dave Davies' impressive guitar work, and Avory's tight and steady drumming, the band became one of the best and most influential groups of British pop and the \"British Invasion\" of the U.S.A., lasting longer than any of their competitors, apart from the Rolling Stones, as they broke up in 1996. Their catalogue of songs has been covered by Van Halen, The Pretenders, The Black Keys, The Stranglers, Queens of the Stone Age , and many more.\n\nMembers:\nRay Davies – vocals, rhythm guitar  (1963–1996)\nDave Davies – lead guitar, vocals (1963–1996)\nPete Quaife – bass guitar (1963–1969)\nJohn Dalton – bass guitar (1969–1976)\nAndy Pyle – bass guitar (1976–1978)\nJim Rodford – bass guitar (1978–1996)\nMick Avory – drums (1963–1984)\nBob Henrit – drums (1984–1996)\nJohn Gosling – keyboards, piano (1970–1978)\nGordon Edwards – keyboards, piano (1978–1979)\nIan Gibbons – keyboards, piano (1979–1989, 1993–1996)\nMark Haley – keyboards, piano (1989–1993) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
