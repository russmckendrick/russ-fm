      "biography": "Rush were a Canadian rock band formed in 1968 in Toronto, that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their 1974 self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.\n\nRush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with Fly by Night (1975), 2112 (1976), A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984) and Counterparts (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.\n\nRush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.\n\nAs of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nRush (1974)\nFly by Night (1975)\nCaress of Steel (1975)\n2112 (1976)\nA Farewell to Kings (1977)\nHemispheres (1978)\nPermanent Waves (1980)\nMoving Pictures (1981)\nSignals (1982)\nGrace Under Pressure (1984)\nPower Windows (1985)\nHold Your Fire (1987)\nPresto (1989)\nRoll the Bones (1991)\nCounterparts (1993)\nTest for Echo (1996)\nVapor Trails (2002)\nSnakes & Arrows (2007)\nClockwork Angels (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Presto is the thirteenth studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). The album was recorded at Le Studio in Morin Heights and at McClear Place in Toronto. It was the band's first album with their new label Atlantic Records which the band signed to in early 1989 after deciding not to renew its contract with Mercury/PolyGram Records. The Atlantic label gave Rush creative control over its future musical direction. Intended to be co-produced with Peter Collins, who had produced the previous two studio albums, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, he reluctantly declined the offer for personal reasons. An objective ear was found in Rupert Hine, who may have contributed to the record's relatively dark, reverb-heavy sound.\n\n\nMusical style and direction\nThe album is generally held by fans to have marked the beginning of a transition period, wherein the synthesizer-heavy songwriting of the 1980s began to give way to a more guitar-oriented sound in later releases. At the very least, synthesizers and sequencers are generally used in a more discreet fashion compared to previous records. “Chain Lightning”, \"Scars\", \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" and “Red Tide” still feature keyboards as a prominent instrument, but other songs like “Show Don’t Tell” and “Superconductor” are more guitar-motivated. Additionally, \"Available Light\" and \"Red Tide\" represent some of the few Rush songs to contain significant piano usage. Bass lines continue to follow the usual Rush style, however, “The Pass” is driven heavily by bass guitar chords.\n\n\"Scars\" features a complex drum pattern in which both acoustic and electronic drums are utilized. The pattern was derived from a tribal rhythm Neil Peart experienced while on a bicycle tour of Africa (later chronicled in his first book, The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa). Peart has gone on to incorporate this pattern into his live drum solos. The song also features the use of a sequencer in place of, and often mistaken for, a bass guitar.\n\nAccording to Geddy Lee during the Rush in Rio concert, “The Pass” is one of the band’s favorite songs.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll music written by Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee and lyrics written by Neil Peart.\n\n\"Show Don't Tell\" – 5:01 \n\"Chain Lightning\" – 4:33 \n\"The Pass\" – 4:51 \n\"War Paint\" – 5:24 \n\"Scars\" – 4:07 \n\"Presto\" – 5:45 \n\"Superconductor\" – 4:47 \n\"Anagram (For Mongo)\" – 4:00 \n\"Red Tide\" – 4:29 \n\"Hand over Fist\" – 4:11 \n\"Available Light\" – 5:03 \n\nPersonnel\nGeddy Lee - bass guitar, synthesizers, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals \nNeil Peart - drums, percussion \nRupert Hine - additional keyboards \n\nMiscellanea\nThe subtitle of \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" is a reference to the line \"Candygram for Mongo\" from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles. The song was originally titled just \"Anagram\". \"Who is Mongo?\" is one of the questions most frequently asked to Neil Peart about his song titles along with \"What is the 'Gangster Of Boats Trilogy'?\" from \"Where's My Thing\" on Roll The Bones. \nThis was the first Rush album where Neil Peart's lyrics used American, rather than British/Canadian spellings; i.e., \"favorite\" instead of \"favourite\", which he still uses. \nAs the album's title alludes to magical themes, some of the album's song titles refer to different magic tricks and associated phrases; \"The Pass\", for example, is a popular card trick. \n\nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1990 The Billboard 200 16 \n\n\nSingles\n \"Show Don't Tell\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rupert Hine and Rush \nChart positions: #1 US Mainstream Rock \n \n \"The Pass\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rupert Hine and Rush \nChart positions: #15 US Mainstream Rock \n \n \"Superconductor\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rupert Hine and Rush \nChart positions: #37 US Mainstream Rock \n \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/Presto\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was recorded at Le Studio in Morin Heights and at McClear Place in Toronto. It was the band's first album with their new label Atlantic Records which the band signed to in early 1989 after deciding not to renew its contract with Mercury/PolyGram Records. The Atlantic label gave Rush creative control over its future musical direction. Intended to be co-produced with Peter Collins, who had produced the previous two studio albums, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, he reluctantly declined the offer for personal reasons. An objective ear was found in Rupert Hine, who may have contributed to the record's relatively dark, reverb-heavy sound.\n\n\nMusical style and direction\nThe album is generally held by fans to have marked the beginning of a transition period, wherein the synthesizer-heavy songwriting of the 1980s began to give way to a more guitar-oriented sound in later releases. At the very least, synthesizers and sequencers are generally used in a more discreet fashion compared to previous records. “Chain Lightning”, \"Scars\", \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" and “Red Tide” still feature keyboards as a prominent instrument, but other songs like “Show Don’t Tell” and “Superconductor” are more guitar-motivated. Additionally, \"Available Light\" and \"Red Tide\" represent some of the few Rush songs to contain significant piano usage. Bass lines continue to follow the usual Rush style, however, “The Pass” is driven heavily by bass guitar chords.\n\n\"Scars\" features a complex drum pattern in which both acoustic and electronic drums are utilized. The pattern was derived from a tribal rhythm Neil Peart experienced while on a bicycle tour of Africa (later chronicled in his first book, The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa). Peart has gone on to incorporate this pattern into his live drum solos. The song also features the use of a sequencer in place of, and often mistaken for, a bass guitar.\n\nAccording to Geddy Lee during the Rush in Rio concert, “The Pass” is one of the band’s favorite songs.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll music written by Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee and lyrics written by Neil Peart.\n\n\"Show Don't Tell\" – 5:01 \n\"Chain Lightning\" – 4:33 \n\"The Pass\" – 4:51 \n\"War Paint\" – 5:24 \n\"Scars\" – 4:07 \n\"Presto\" – 5:45 \n\"Superconductor\" – 4:47 \n\"Anagram (For Mongo)\" – 4:00 \n\"Red Tide\" – 4:29 \n\"Hand over Fist\" – 4:11 \n\"Available Light\" – 5:03 \n\nPersonnel\nGeddy Lee - bass guitar, synthesizers, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals \nNeil Peart - drums, percussion \nRupert Hine - additional keyboards \n\nMiscellanea\nThe subtitle of \"Anagram (for Mongo)\" is a reference to the line \"Candygram for Mongo\" from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles. The song was originally titled just \"Anagram\". \"Who is Mongo?\" is one of the questions most frequently asked to Neil Peart about his song titles along with \"What is the 'Gangster Of Boats Trilogy'?\" from \"Where's My Thing\" on Roll The Bones. \nThis was the first Rush album where Neil Peart's lyrics used American, rather than British/Canadian spellings; i.e., \"favorite\" instead of \"favourite\", which he still uses. \nAs the album's title alludes to magical themes, some of the album's song titles refer to different magic tricks and associated phrases; \"The Pass\", for example, is a popular card trick. \n\nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1990 The Billboard 200 16 \n\n\nSingles\n \"Show Don't Tell\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rupert Hine and Rush \nChart positions: #1 US Mainstream Rock \n \n \"The Pass\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rupert Hine and Rush \nChart positions: #15 US Mainstream Rock \n \n \"Superconductor\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rupert Hine and Rush \nChart positions: #37 US Mainstream Rock \n \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/Presto\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
