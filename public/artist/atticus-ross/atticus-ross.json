  "biography": "Atticus Matthew Cowper Ross (born 16 January 1968) is an English musician, record producer, composer, and audio engineer. Along with Trent Reznor, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Score for The Social Network in 2010. In 2013, the pair won a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for their soundtrack to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. In 2021, alongside Jon Batiste, they won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for the soundtrack for Pixar's Soul.\n\nRoss began working with Reznor on the latter's side project Tapeworm in 2002. He later worked with Reznor's band Nine Inch Nails, first as a programmer and producer in 2005, and became the only official member of the band outside of Reznor in 2016.\n\nAtticus Matthew Cowper Ross was born in the Ladbroke Grove area of London on 16 January 1968, the son of Roxana Lampson and Ian Ross. His father was a founder of Radio Caroline. He has five siblings, including fashion model Liberty Ross and fellow musician Leopold Ross. His maternal grandfather was diplomat Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn, his great-grandfather was Italian pathologist and bacteriologist Aldo Castellani, and his uncle is British-American journalist Charles Glass. Ross was educated at Eton College, where he was a few years below future UK Prime Ministers David Cameron and Boris Johnson, and later at the Courtauld Institute of Art.\n\nRoss came to notice in the mid-1990s as a programmer for Tim Simenon's Bomb the Bass during the period of the albums Unknown Territory and Clear. He worked on a number of production and remix projects with Simenon, as well as forming a collaborative relationship with Barry Adamson. He programmed The Negro Inside Me and Oedipus Schmoedipus, and produced As Above So Below before forming his own band, 12 Rounds, with his wife Claudia Sarne and Adam Holden. They released two albums, Jitterjuice and My Big Hero. A third full-length album was produced by Trent Reznor, but was ultimately never finished. Three songs from that album have since been released on the band's website.\n\nRoss moved to the United States in 2000, and as of 2002 was working alongside Reznor for his side project Tapeworm. He has been credited as a producer and/or programmer on the Nine Inch Nails albums With Teeth, Year Zero, Ghosts I–IV (on which he was a co-writer), The Slip, and Hesitation Marks. He has worked with Reznor in numerous other capacities, including work with Saul Williams and Zack de la Rocha, and they co-produced tracks for a reformed Jane's Addiction with Alan Moulder in 2009.\n\nOther work has included two co-productions with Joe Barresi, the Loverman EP Human Nurture and Coheed and Cambria's Year of the Black Rainbow, as well as albums for Korn. He has also produced tracks or created remixes for such artists as Grace Jones, Perry Farrell, and Telepathe. In May 2010, he appeared in a cryptic video and was named as a member of a secret project, later revealed to be How to Destroy Angels, a collaboration between Reznor and his wife Mariqueen Maandig. In 2016, Ross composed an original score titled 'The Journey' for FIFA 17's new single-player story campaign mode. In 2020, he co-produced and co-wrote one track on Jehnny Beth's To Love Is to Live. In 2021, Ross and Reznor produced and co-wrote Halsey's album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power.\n\nRoss' work in film music began in 2004 when he scored the Hughes Brothers' TV series Touching Evil with his wife Claudia Sarne and brother Leopold Ross. He has since provided music for two further Hughes Brothers projects: Allen Hughes' vignette in the film New York, I Love You, and Ross' first feature film, The Book of Eli (2010). The latter's score was released through Reprise Records on 12 January 2010. It won at the BMI Awards and earned Ross a nomination as \"Discovery of the Year\" at the 2010 World Soundtrack Awards.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, Reznor announced that he and Ross were scoring David Fincher's new film The Social Network. The film's soundtrack was released on 28 September 2010, and was highly praised. On 16 January 2011, they won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for their score to The Social Network. On 27 February, they received the Academy Award for Best Original Score for The Social Network. Ross and Reznor again collaborated on the soundtrack to Fincher's 2011 film Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. In 2013, the pair won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for their Girl with the Dragon Tattoo soundtrack.\n\nRoss was slated to work on the 2013 samurai epic 47 Ronin, but was soon replaced by Javier Navarrete. Ross and Reznor again teamed up with Fincher to score his 2014 film Gone Girl. In 2016, Ross and Reznor, along with composer Gustavo Santaolalla and the band Mogwai, collaborated to create the score to the documentary film Before the Flood.\n\nIn June 2017, Ross, along with Reznor, Maandig, Robin Finck, Joey Castillo, and Alessandro Cortini, appeared as \"The Nine Inch Nails\" in Episode 8 of Twin Peaks: The Return on Showtime, performing an alternative live rendition of the song \"She's Gone Away\" which previously appeared on Nine Inch Nails' 2016 EP Not the Actual Events.\n\nIn 2021, Reznor, Ross, and Jon Batiste won the Golden Globe for the soundtrack for Soul. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Atticus+Ross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
