      "biography": "Dire Straits were a British rock band, formed in 1977 by former journalist and teacher Mark Knopfler, initially composed of Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), his younger brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion).\n Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more \"rootsy\" influence that emerged out of pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic.\n Dire Straits' biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies. They also became one of the world's most commercially successful bands, with worldwide album sales of over 120 million. Dire Straits won numerous music awards during their career, including four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards-winning Best British Group twice, and two MTV Video Music Awards. The band' most popular songs include \"Sultans of Swing\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Tunnel of Love\", \"Private Investigations\", \"Money for Nothing\", \"Walk of Life\", \"So Far Away\", \"Your Latest Trick\" and \"Brothers in Arms\".\n Dire Straits' career spanned 18 years. There were several changes in personnel over that period, leaving Mark Knopfler and John Illsley as the only two original bandmates who had remained throughout the band's career. Dire Straits disbanded in 1995 when Mark Knopfler launched his career full time as a solo artist.",

            "content": "Brothers in Arms is the fifth studio album by British rock band Dire Straits, released in 1985. The first half of the album is a development of their unique brand of arena rock which had evolved in their music since the 1980 album Making Movies, while the second half consists of more folk-influenced material. The whole album maintains the original Dire Straits' bluesy and laid back guitar-based sound whilst retaining a more lavish and bombastic production and overall sound. It is the band's best selling album. \n\nBrothers in Arms was one of the first albums to be directed at the CD market, and was a full digital recording (DDD), at a time when most popular music was recorded on analog equipment. It was also released on vinyl and cassette.\n\nBrothers in Arms was the first album to sell one million copies in the CD format and to outsell its LP version. A Rykodisc staffer would subsequently write, \" were fighting to get our CDs manufactured because the entire worldwide manufacturing capacity was overwhelmed by demand for a single rock title (Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms).\"\n\nIt was remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the U.S. and on September 19, 2000 in the United States. It was also released in XRCD2 format in 2000, Super Audio CD format on July 26, 2005 and DualDisc format on August 16, 2005, winning a Grammy for Best Surround Sound Album.\n\nIn 2006, a half-speed-mastered vinyl version of the album was issued. Mastered by the renowned Stan Ricker, this version puts the full-length songs on vinyl for the first time. In order to do this, the album spans four sides on two 33 1/3 rpm discs.\n\nIn 2000 Q magazine placed Brothers in Arms at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 351 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In November 2006, the results of a national poll conducted by the public of Australia revealed their top 100 favourite albums. Brothers in Arms came in at number 64 (see \"My Favourite Album\").\n\nAs of April 30 2008, Brothers in Arms was 5th on the list of best-selling albums (UK) and is the 107th best-selling album in the United States.\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards.\n\nPersonnel:\nMark Knopfler: guitar, lead vocals\nJohn Illsley: bass, vocals\nAlan Clark: organ, synth, piano\nGuy Fletcher: synth, vocals\nTerry Williams: drums\nAdditional Personnel:\nOmar Hakim: drums\nJack Sonni: guitar\nMichael Brecker: saxophone\nRandy Brecker: horn\nMalcolm Duncan: tenor saxophone\nNeil Jason: bass\nTony Levin: bass\nJimmy Maelen: percussion\nMichael Mainieri: background vocals\nDave Plews: horn\nSting: vocals on Money for Nothing\"\n\nReleased 13 May 1985\nRecorded November 1984 - March 1985 AIR Studios, Montserrat\nAIR Studios, London - Power Station, New York\nLength 55:07 (CD)\n47:21 (LP)\nLabel Vertigo (UK), Warner Bros.
