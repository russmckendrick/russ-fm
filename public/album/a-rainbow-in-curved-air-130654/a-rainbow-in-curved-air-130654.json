      "biography": "Terry Riley (born June 24, 1935) is an American composer associated with the minimalist school.\n\nBorn in Colfax, California, United States, Riley studied at Shasta College, San Francisco State University, and the San Francisco Conservatory before earning an MA in composition at the University of California, Berkeley, studying with Seymour Shifrin and Robert Erickson. He was involved in the experimental San Francisco Tape Music Center working with Morton Subotnick, Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros, and Ramon Sender. His most influential teacher, however, was Pandit Pran Nath (1918-1996), a master of Indian classical voice, who also taught La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela. Riley made numerous trips to India over the course of their association to study and to accompany him on tabla, tambura, and voice. Throughout the 1960s he traveled frequently around Europe as well, taking in musical influences and supporting himself by playing in piano bars, until he joined the Mills College faculty in 1971 to teach Indian classical music. Riley was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Music at Chapman University in 2007.\n\nWhile his early endeavours were influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Riley changed direction after first encountering La Monte Young, in whose Theater of Eternal Music he later performed from 1965-66. The String Quartet (1960) was Riley's first work in this new style; it was followed shortly after by a string trio, in which he first employed the repetitive short phrases that he (and minimalism) are now known for.\n\nHis music is usually based on improvising through a series of modal figures of different lengths, such as in In C and the Keyboard Studies. In C (1964) is probably Riley's best-known work and one that brought the minimalist music movement to prominence. Its first performance was given by Steve Reich, Jon Gibson, Pauline Oliveros, and Morton Subotnick, among others, and it has influenced their work and that of many others, including John Adams, Roberto Carnevale, and Philip Glass. Its form was an innovation: the piece consists of 53 separate modules of roughly one measure apiece, each containing a different musical pattern but each, as the title implies, in C. One performer beats a steady pulse of Cs on the piano to keep tempo. The others, in any number and on any instrument, perform these musical modules following a few loose guidelines, with the different musical modules interlocking in various ways as time goes on. The Keyboard Studies are similarly structured – a single-performer version of the same concept.\n\nIn the 1950s he was already working with tape loops, a technology then in its infancy, and he has continued manipulating tapes to musical effect, both in the studio and in live performance, throughout his career. He has composed in just intonation as well as microtonal pieces.\n\nRiley's collaborators include the Rova Saxophone Quartet, Pauline Oliveros, and, as mentioned, the Kronos Quartet.\n\nHe has also had a notable collaboration with Beat poet Michael McClure, with whom he has released several CDs and most recently contributed music to a London revival of his play The Beard.\n\nA Rainbow In Curved Air inspired Pete Townshend's synthesizer parts on The Who's \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and \"Baba O'Riley\", the latter named in tribute to Riley as well as to Meher Baba.\n\nAlso during the 1960s were the famous \"All-Night Concerts\", during which Riley performed mostly improvised music from evening until sunrise, using an old organ harmonium (\"with a vacuum cleaner motor blower blowing into the ballasts\") and tape-delayed saxophone. When he finally wanted a break, after hours of playing, he played back looped saxophone fragments recorded throughout the evening. For several years he continued to put on these concerts, to which people came with sleeping bags, hammocks, and their whole families.\n\nRiley began his long-lasting association with the Kronos Quartet by meeting its founder, David Harrington, while at Mills. Over the course of his career Riley has composed 13 string quartets for the ensemble, in addition to other works. He wrote his first orchestral piece, Jade Palace, in 1991, and has continued to pursue that avenue, with several commissioned orchestral compositions following. Riley is also currently performing and teaching both as an Indian raga vocalist and as a solo pianist.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.terryriley.net <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Riley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "A Rainbow In Curved Air is the third album by experimental music artist Terry Riley. Through the use of overdubbing, Riley plays all the instruments on the title track: electric organ, 2 electric harpsichords (a Baldwin electric harpsichord & a RMI Rock-Si-Chord), dumbec (or goblet drum), and tambourine.\n\nThe largely improvisational nature of the work, based on modal scales, owes much to jazz and Hindustani classical music. Some jazz musicians had explored overdubbing techniques before, notably Bill Evans, one of Riley's piano \"heroes\", on his classic album Conversations with Myself from four years earlier, with its three piano tracks; but Riley uses a far wider range of instruments and colors.\n\nAlthough continuous in form, A Rainbow in Curved Air can be seen as having three distinct sections or \"movements,\" like a classical sonata or concerto. The first \"fast\" section gives way to a more contemplative \"slow movement\" at 6:39. Then, the final more rhythmic section begins at 11:41, dominated by the dumbec, which creates a parallel to how a tabla enters in the final section of a Hindustani raga. The work then ends abruptly. The combination of the one-man-band overdubbing, electronic instruments, and improvisation made for a unique and influential recording, a defining psychedelic work of the 1960s, enhanced by its cover art and the peace poem that constitutes the liner notes.\n\nThe companion piece, which constituted the \"B\" side of the original album, is titled \"Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band.\" It also employs overdubbing, with Riley again playing all instruments, this time a soprano saxophone (inspired by the playing of John Coltrane) and electric organ. In addition, Riley used a time lag accumulator, consisting of two tape machines, looped audio tape, and a patch cord (this is the \"Phantom Band\" of the title). A note on the album explains that \"The spatially separated mirror images were adapted for studio recording by Glen Kolotkin and resemble the sound Terry gets in his all-night concerts.\"\n\nThe original LP jacket includes a poem on the back cover, written by Riley:\n\nAnd then all wars ended / Arms of every kind were outlawed and the masses gladly contributed them to giant foundries in which they were melted down and the metal poured back into the earth / The Pentagon was turned on its side and painted purple, yellow & green / All boundaries were dissolved / The slaughter of animals was forbidden / The whole of lower Manhattan became a meadow in which unfortunates from the Bowery were allowed to live out their fantasies in the sunshine and were cured / People swam in the sparkling rivers under blue skies streaked only with incense pouring from the new factories / The energy from dismantled nuclear weapons provided free heat and light / World health was restored / An abundance of organic vegetables, fruits and grains was growing wild along the discarded highways / National flags were sewn together into brightly colored circus tents under which politicians were allowed to perform harmless theatrical games / The concept of work was forgotten\n\nLP Track listing\nA1 A Rainbow In Curved Air (18:44)\nB1 Poppy Nogood And The Phantom Band (21:39)\nTotal Time: (40:03)\n\nCredits \nSide 1: Electric Organ, Electric, ‘Rocksichord’ Harpsichord, Goblet Drum (Dumbec), Tambourine: Terry Riley\nSide 2: Soprano Saxophone, Electric Organ: Terry Riley\n\nEngineer: Glen Kolotkin, Roy Segal\nProducer: David Behrman\nArtwork: Virginia Team (Columbia LP Back), John Berg (Columbia LP Front)\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Riley/A+Rainbow+in+Curved+Air\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
