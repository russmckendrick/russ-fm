      "biography": "Big Big Train is an English progressive rock band that was founded in 1990. Based in Bournemouth, England, the band members are Nick D'Virgilio, Dave Gregory, David Longdon, Danny Manners, Andy Poole and Gregory Spawton.\n\nTheir first album, Goodbye To The Age of Steam was released in 1994 and was co-produced by Martin Orford of IQ. Age of Steam established the typical melancholy BBT sound influenced by progressive rock from the mid and early 1970s.\n\nAfter two releases which featured more accessible music, BBT went back to their roots in 2004 and released a concept album called Gathering Speed. This album featured layers of 12-string guitar and mellotron and also hints at a growing post rock influence. Whilst arguably more derivative than some of their earlier releases, Gathering Speed was a very assured album and was critically well received.\n\nWith a new singer, Sean Filkins, and with Steve Hughes back on drums after stints with The Enid and Kino, BBT released their fifth studio album, The Difference Machine, in 2007. The album features performances from Nick D'Virgilio (Spock's Beard, Genesis, Tears for Fears); Dave Meros (Spock's Beard) and Pete Trewavas (Marillion, Transatlantic, Kino) In 2008 BBT released an updated version of their 1997 album, English Boy Wonders.\n\nBBT released their sixth studio album, The Underfall Yard, on 15 December 2009. Steve Hughes and Sean Filkins left the band prior to the recording of The Underfall Yard, with Filkins being replaced by singer David Longdon. Dave Gregory (XTC), Jem Godfrey (Frost*) and Francis Dunnery (It Bites) make guest appearances on the album.",

            "content": "Ingenious Devices consists of new versions of East Coast Racer, Brooklands and Voyager, which feature an elite 17-piece string section recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London.\n\nWith the exception of the late David Longdon’s lead vocals, which have been compiled from the original album sessions, East Coast Racer is a completely new studio version recorded by the line-up of the band as it was in 2019. Brooklands features newly recorded drums, bass and bass pedals, while Voyager includes additional guitar and violin. All three songs have been re-mixed for this release and all the audio is presented at 24/96.\n\nIngenious Devices also includes a previously unreleased orchestral piece called The Book of Ingenious Devices, which links East Coast Racer and Brooklands.\n\nBBT's Gregory Spawton explains: “I was always happy with the original recorded version of East Coast Racer, but re-arranging the song to feature a full string section gave ECR a further lift. The new recording also features Dave Gregory’s guitar solo on the closing section, a solo which has only previously featured on live performances of the song. I am pleased we now have the definitive studio version on Ingenious Devices. The timing of this release also deliberately ties in with the 85th anniversary of the Mallard’s speed record which inspired the lyric.\n\n“By contrast, I was never entirely satisfied with Brooklands and felt it got a bit overlooked on the Folklore album. The Abbey Road strings have significantly enhanced the song and I’m delighted with the outcome. The additional track, The Book Of Ingenious Devices was composed to act as a segue between East Coast Racer and Brooklands and I like the way the tracks now flow into each other. The changes to Voyager are more subtle but still elevate the song beyond the version on our Grand Tour album.”\n\nIngenious Devices also features a live performance of Atlantic Cable, recorded at Friars, Aylesbury in September 2022.\n\nNew BBT vocalist Alberto Bravin comments: “Atlantic Cable was recorded at our second show of the tour last year. It’s not an easy song to play at all and we were both amazed and relieved that we pulled it off so well. I experienced a real baptism of fire playing that show in front of over 1,000 passionate BBT fans, but their response to the song and the rest of our live set that night was truly motivating.”\n\nNick D’Virgilio says: “Ingenious Devices is a great way of uniting four of Big Big Train’s epic songs about technology. The album also celebrates the wonderful vocals of our late, great friend David Longdon on East Coast Racer, Brooklands and Voyager and looks forward to the future with Alberto putting in such a great performance on Atlantic Cable.”\n\nThe Bandcamp download of Ingenious Devices includes a PDF of the album booklet, with lyrics and credits. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Big+Big+Train/Ingenious+Devices\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
