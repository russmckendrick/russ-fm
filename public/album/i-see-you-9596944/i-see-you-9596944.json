      "biography": "The xx is an English indie rock band from Wandsworth, London, formed in 2005. The band consists of  Romy Madley Croft (guitar, vocals), Oliver Sim (bass guitar, vocals), Jamie Smith, also known as Jamie xx (beats, MPC, record production), and formerly Baria Qureshi (keyboard, guitar). The band is known for the distinct and minimalist sound that blends indie rock, indie electronic, indie pop, dream pop and electro-rock and the dual vocalist setup of both Madley Croft and Sim. Their music employs soft, echoed guitar, prominent bass, light electronic beats and ambient soundscape backgrounds\n\nOn 17 August 2009, the group released their debut album xx on Young Turks label. The album was recorded in a small garage and produced by the band. It garnered critical acclaim and has been generally well-received, scoring an average of 86/100 based on 24 professional reviews. Also it ranked on \"best of the year\" lists with Rolling Stone placing it at #9 and NME placing it at #2.\n\nFour singles were released from their debut album: \"Crystalised\", \"Basic Space\", \"Islands\" and \"VCR\".\n\nThe xx also remixed the classic song \"You've Got The Love\" originally written by The Source and covered by Florence + the Machine. They also added their own vocals on the song. The group won the 2010 Mercury Prize for their album on 7th September 2010. After being the bookies' favourites for many of the weeks leading up to the announcement, they beat eleven other acts.\n\n\"Angels\" was the first single from The xx’s second album, Coexist. It was released on July 16 2012. A second track from the album, \"Chained\", was released on line prior to the official Coexist launch on 11 September.\n\nIn June 2014, it was revealed in an interview with Dazed that the trio were working on their third studio album, with producer Rodaidh McDonald at the Marfa Recording Company studio in Marfa, Texas. Further writing and recording sessions were held in London, New York, Reykavik and Los Angeles.  The 2016 album 'I See You' title and tracklist, were revealed after untitled audio clips uploaded to Spotify were matched on Shazam. 'On Hold' was launched on November 10th.\n\nhttp://thexx.info <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+xx\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
