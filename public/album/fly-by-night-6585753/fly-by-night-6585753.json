      "biography": "Rush were a Canadian rock band formed in 1968 in Toronto, that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their 1974 self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.\n\nRush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with Fly by Night (1975), 2112 (1976), A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984) and Counterparts (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.\n\nRush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.\n\nAs of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nRush (1974)\nFly by Night (1975)\nCaress of Steel (1975)\n2112 (1976)\nA Farewell to Kings (1977)\nHemispheres (1978)\nPermanent Waves (1980)\nMoving Pictures (1981)\nSignals (1982)\nGrace Under Pressure (1984)\nPower Windows (1985)\nHold Your Fire (1987)\nPresto (1989)\nRoll the Bones (1991)\nCounterparts (1993)\nTest for Echo (1996)\nVapor Trails (2002)\nSnakes & Arrows (2007)\nClockwork Angels (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Fly by Night is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in February 1975.\n \nThis was the first Rush album to feature drummer Neil Peart. In addition to drumming duties, Peart also took on the job of lyricist by default, leading the band to adopt a more literary lyrical style that differed significantly from the debut album. The songs \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Rivendell\" are examples of the inclusion of fantasy themes into Rush's music, although the latter was penned by Geddy Lee.\n\n\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" was inspired by Rush roadie Howard Ungerleider's story of him staying at Anthem records owner Ray Danniels' house, where his two dogs, a German shepherd growled at him, and a tiny dog tried to jump on him. Ungerleider told Rush about it and they thought it was hilarious.\n\n\"Anthem\" features lyrics inspired by the philosophy of Ayn Rand, whose influence on Peart's writing would reach its apogee on the band's 1976 album 2112. The autobiographical \"Fly by Night\" is based on Peart's experience of moving from Canada to London as a young musician (long before joining Rush), while \"Making Memories\" appears to be an account of experiences from the band's first tour. The original hand-penned lyrics for both \"Anthem\" and \"Fly by Night\" include different or additional lyrics not sung in the original songs. Although the original lyrics for \"Anthem\" include the line \"carry your head\", they are sung as \"hold your head\", as well as other minor changes such as a change from \"anthem of the heart and mind\" to \"anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind\". The original lyrics to \"Fly By Night\" include a prologue which is not found in the final song.\n\nFly by Night was recorded at Toronto Sound Studios in Toronto. Rush also recorded parts of their first album at the same studio. However, since the first album sessions the studio was updated from 1 inch 8-track to 2 inch 16-track master tape recorders. The new equipment allowed the group to have far more flexibility in overdubbing and mixing. Pictures shown on the album artwork indicate that the studio used a Studer 16 track recorder and a Neve mixing console. This combination was widely considered to be state of the art by audio engineers. It was also used by many other top studios worldwide up through the early 1990's. Fly by Night marked the debut of Terry Brown as producer (although he had remixed their debut release.) This was a role he would maintain until 1982's Signals.\n\n\n\nAll songs written by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, except where noted.\n\n\nSide one\n\"Anthem\" – 4:10 \n\"Best I Can\" (Lee) – 3:24 \n\"Beneath, Between & Behind\" (Lifeson, Peart) – 3:00 \n\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" – 8:37 \nI. At the Tobes of Hades \nII. Across the Styx \nIII. Of the Battle \nChallenge and Defiance \n7/4 War Furor \nAftermath \nHymn of Triumph \nIV.
