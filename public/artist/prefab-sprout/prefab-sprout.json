  "biography": "Prefab Sprout are an English pop band from Witton Gilbert, County Durham formed in 1976, who rose to fame during the 1980s. Though critically acclaimed, and considered by many to have released some of the best pop albums of the decade, the band never matched this acclaim with commercial success. The band's best known lineup comprised Paddy McAloon (vocals, guitar, keyboard), Wendy Smith (vocals, guitar, keyboard), Martin McAloon (bass), and Neil Conti (drums).\n\nTheir biggest commercial and critical success came with 1990's Jordan: The Comeback (one of two albums produced by Thomas Dolby), which was a hit in the UK and nominated for a BRIT award. The band also had a UK Top 10 hit with their 1988 song The King of Rock 'n' Roll.\n\nPerhaps their finest album, Steve McQueen (originally released in June 1985) was re-released in August 2007 as a 2-CD deluxe edition, with a bonus disc of eight acoustic reinterpretations of some of the original tracks. Of the release, the record company said: \"Digitally remastered by original producer Thomas Dolby, the album is sounding even better than ever.  As if that weren't enough it is complemented here with a second disc containing eight sublime acoustic versions, which have been specially re-recorded for this release by Paddy McAloon.\"\n\nSteve McQueen was released in the US under the title Two Wheels Good following pressure from the late actor's estate.\n\nPrefab Sprout released Let's Change the World With Music - The Blueprint in 2009 on the Kitchenware Records label (website).  See also Sprout Trivia below.\n\nDiscography:\nLions In My Own Garden (Exit Someone) / Radio Love - Feb 25, 1982 (their first record, released on their own label Candle)\nThe Devil Has All the Best Tunes / Walk On - Oct 1983 (Kitchenware) (feat.
