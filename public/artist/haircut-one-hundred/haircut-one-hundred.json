  "biography": "Haircut One Hundred are a British pop group formed in 1980 by Nick Heyward. The band had four UK Top 10 hit singles between 1981 and 1982, including \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\" and \"Love Plus One\".\nNick Heyward and Les Nemes had been in several bands together since 1977. They were first known as Rugby, then as The Boat Party, then as Captain Pennyworth and lastly as Moving England before finally becoming Haircut One Hundred. By this time, Heyward and Nemes had met guitarist Graham Jones, and were joined by drummer Pat Hunt. Managed by Karl Adams, the band recorded some demos. Phil Smith played saxophone on the sessions and he joined the group, followed by Mark Fox who played percussion. The group played some live dates and were signed by Arista Records in 1981. They entered Chalk Farmâ€™s Roundhouse studios to record their debut single \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\", which became their first hit, reaching number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1981, and saw them make their first appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops.\n\nFor the recording of their debut album, Blair Cunningham replaced Pat Hunt on drums. Their second single was \"Love Plus One\", which was released in early 1982 and gave the band their second UK Top 10 hit. It was soon followed by the release of their debut album, Pelican West, which reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe band became internationally famous and toured the globe. \"Love Plus One\" reached the US Top 40, and they secured further UK Top 10 hits in 1982 with the singles \"Fantastic Day\" and \"Nobody's Fool\".\n\nIn late 1982, tensions began arising within the band as they struggled to record new material which was hindered when Heyward was refusing to attend recording sessions. Eventually, in January 1983, the band were about to release a new single, \"Whistle Down the Wind\", which was then postponed and a statement was issued confirming that the band and Heyward were parting company. At the time, Heyward told Smash Hits magazine that he had been contemplating going solo for some time and had already recorded some tracks with session musicians. However, many years later, Heyward stated that he had been struggling with stress and depression at the time after a year of constant work and pressure which led to him being, in effect, sacked by the other members of the band. With the loss of the band's frontman and main songwriter, Mark Fox took over vocal duties and the band continued to write material themselves (several B-sides during Heyward's tenure had been credited to the whole band). The band left Arista and signed with Polydor Records, but further singles by this line-up failed to reach the UK Top 40 and their follow-up album, Paint and Paint (1984) failed to chart. The band split up soon after. Heyward, however, embarked on a briefly successful solo career in 1983, and scored several chart hits (including the aforementioned song \"Whistle Down the Wind\", which was his first solo release in March 1983) and a Top 10 album, North of a Miracle.\n\nIn 2004, more than 20 years after their split, Haircut 100 (including Heyward) reunited for the VH1 show Bands Reunited and performed \"Love Plus One\" and \"Fantastic Day\".\n\nIn 2009, they rekindled their friendship via Facebook, and Heyward invited the rest of the band to perform at one of his solo gigs. The band (comprising Heyward, Jones, Nemes and Cunningham) then played London's indigO2 on 28 January 2011, performing Pelican West in its entirety. The performance was recorded and released as a live CD. The band's official website also states they have been working on new material together, but this has yet to materialise.",

      "biography_en": "Haircut One Hundred are a British pop group formed in 1980 by Nick Heyward. The band had four UK Top 10 hit singles between 1981 and 1982, including \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\" and \"Love Plus One\".\nNick Heyward and Les Nemes had been in several bands together since 1977. They were first known as Rugby, then as The Boat Party, then as Captain Pennyworth and lastly as Moving England before finally becoming Haircut One Hundred. By this time, Heyward and Nemes had met guitarist Graham Jones, and were joined by drummer Pat Hunt. Managed by Karl Adams, the band recorded some demos. Phil Smith played saxophone on the sessions and he joined the group, followed by Mark Fox who played percussion. The group played some live dates and were signed by Arista Records in 1981. They entered Chalk Farmâ€™s Roundhouse studios to record their debut single \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\", which became their first hit, reaching number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1981, and saw them make their first appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops.\n\nFor the recording of their debut album, Blair Cunningham replaced Pat Hunt on drums. Their second single was \"Love Plus One\", which was released in early 1982 and gave the band their second UK Top 10 hit. It was soon followed by the release of their debut album, Pelican West, which reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe band became internationally famous and toured the globe. \"Love Plus One\" reached the US Top 40, and they secured further UK Top 10 hits in 1982 with the singles \"Fantastic Day\" and \"Nobody's Fool\".\n\nIn late 1982, tensions began arising within the band as they struggled to record new material which was hindered when Heyward was refusing to attend recording sessions. Eventually, in January 1983, the band were about to release a new single, \"Whistle Down the Wind\", which was then postponed and a statement was issued confirming that the band and Heyward were parting company. At the time, Heyward told Smash Hits magazine that he had been contemplating going solo for some time and had already recorded some tracks with session musicians. However, many years later, Heyward stated that he had been struggling with stress and depression at the time after a year of constant work and pressure which led to him being, in effect, sacked by the other members of the band. With the loss of the band's frontman and main songwriter, Mark Fox took over vocal duties and the band continued to write material themselves (several B-sides during Heyward's tenure had been credited to the whole band). The band left Arista and signed with Polydor Records, but further singles by this line-up failed to reach the UK Top 40 and their follow-up album, Paint and Paint (1984) failed to chart. The band split up soon after. Heyward, however, embarked on a briefly successful solo career in 1983, and scored several chart hits (including the aforementioned song \"Whistle Down the Wind\", which was his first solo release in March 1983) and a Top 10 album, North of a Miracle.\n\nIn 2004, more than 20 years after their split, Haircut 100 (including Heyward) reunited for the VH1 show Bands Reunited and performed \"Love Plus One\" and \"Fantastic Day\".\n\nIn 2009, they rekindled their friendship via Facebook, and Heyward invited the rest of the band to perform at one of his solo gigs. The band (comprising Heyward, Jones, Nemes and Cunningham) then played London's indigO2 on 28 January 2011, performing Pelican West in its entirety. The performance was recorded and released as a live CD. The band's official website also states they have been working on new material together, but this has yet to materialise.",

      "bio_content": "Haircut One Hundred were a New Wave band, formed in 1980 by Nick Heyward, whose most successful single was Love Plus One. The group broke up in 1984, but then briefly reunited in 2004.\n\nThe band was originally formed by pin-up Heyward (guitar, vocals), Les Nemes (bass), Tim Jenkins (guitar) and Rob Stroud (drums). Jenkins left quite early on when the band was unsigned. He was later followed by Stroud who joined the punk band The Sex Gang Children. Graham Jones left The Low Numbers to join the band, which at the time was named Moving England. Stroud was replaced by Patrick Hunt on drums who played on their first single, Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl). Hunt was fired and replaced by Blair Cunningham. Cunningham replaced the drum track on the album version of \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\", although the single had the original drums played by Hunt. During their early gigs, Phil Smith and Mark Fox were drafted to play saxophone and percussion respectively. Originally meant to be session musicians, they were asked to join the line up of the band when they signed to Arista Records.\n\nHaircut One Hundred appeared just as New Wave was peaking. They were quickly successful: their first single, 1981's \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\" reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. Their next single, \"Love Plus One\", reached number three and broke the Top 40 in the United States. The following two singles Fantastic Day and Nobody's Fool each reached number nine in the UK.\n\nHaircut One Hundred seemed poised for stardom, then Heyward left the band at the end of 1982 to pursue a solo career. Percussionist Marc Fox took Heyward's place as vocalist. In 1984, the band released the album Paint and Paint, but broke up soon after.[1]\n\nIn 2004 all of the band's ex-members reunited for an episode of VH1's series Bands Reunited.\n\nIn 2009, they rekindled their friendship via Facebook, and Heyward invited them to perform at one of his solo gigs. The band then played London's indigO2 on 28 January 2011, performing Pelican West in its entirety, and it was recorded as a live double album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Haircut+One+Hundred\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_en": "Haircut One Hundred are a British pop group formed in 1980 by Nick Heyward. The band had four UK Top 10 hit singles between 1981 and 1982, including \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\" and \"Love Plus One\".\nNick Heyward and Les Nemes had been in several bands together since 1977. They were first known as Rugby, then as The Boat Party, then as Captain Pennyworth and lastly as Moving England before finally becoming Haircut One Hundred. By this time, Heyward and Nemes had met guitarist Graham Jones, and were joined by drummer Pat Hunt. Managed by Karl Adams, the band recorded some demos. Phil Smith played saxophone on the sessions and he joined the group, followed by Mark Fox who played percussion. The group played some live dates and were signed by Arista Records in 1981. They entered Chalk Farmâ€™s Roundhouse studios to record their debut single \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\", which became their first hit, reaching number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1981, and saw them make their first appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops.\n\nFor the recording of their debut album, Blair Cunningham replaced Pat Hunt on drums. Their second single was \"Love Plus One\", which was released in early 1982 and gave the band their second UK Top 10 hit. It was soon followed by the release of their debut album, Pelican West, which reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe band became internationally famous and toured the globe. \"Love Plus One\" reached the US Top 40, and they secured further UK Top 10 hits in 1982 with the singles \"Fantastic Day\" and \"Nobody's Fool\".\n\nIn late 1982, tensions began arising within the band as they struggled to record new material which was hindered when Heyward was refusing to attend recording sessions. Eventually, in January 1983, the band were about to release a new single, \"Whistle Down the Wind\", which was then postponed and a statement was issued confirming that the band and Heyward were parting company. At the time, Heyward told Smash Hits magazine that he had been contemplating going solo for some time and had already recorded some tracks with session musicians. However, many years later, Heyward stated that he had been struggling with stress and depression at the time after a year of constant work and pressure which led to him being, in effect, sacked by the other members of the band. With the loss of the band's frontman and main songwriter, Mark Fox took over vocal duties and the band continued to write material themselves (several B-sides during Heyward's tenure had been credited to the whole band). The band left Arista and signed with Polydor Records, but further singles by this line-up failed to reach the UK Top 40 and their follow-up album, Paint and Paint (1984) failed to chart. The band split up soon after. Heyward, however, embarked on a briefly successful solo career in 1983, and scored several chart hits (including the aforementioned song \"Whistle Down the Wind\", which was his first solo release in March 1983) and a Top 10 album, North of a Miracle.\n\nIn 2004, more than 20 years after their split, Haircut 100 (including Heyward) reunited for the VH1 show Bands Reunited and performed \"Love Plus One\" and \"Fantastic Day\".\n\nIn 2009, they rekindled their friendship via Facebook, and Heyward invited the rest of the band to perform at one of his solo gigs. The band (comprising Heyward, Jones, Nemes and Cunningham) then played London's indigO2 on 28 January 2011, performing Pelican West in its entirety. The performance was recorded and released as a live CD. The band's official website also states they have been working on new material together, but this has yet to materialise.",
