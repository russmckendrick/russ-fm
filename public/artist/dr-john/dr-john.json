  "biography": "Dr. John (born Malcolm John Rebennack on 20 November 1941; died 6 June 2019) was an American singer, pianist, guitarist, and songwriter whose music combined blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll.  The winner of six Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011. He was variously known as Mac Rebennack, Dr. John Creaux, Dr. John, the Night Tripper.\n\nDr. John began making his own idiosyncratic music in the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (\"the lowest time of my life\"), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Dr. John, The Night Tripper. The name \"Dr. John\" came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.\n\nDr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits' \"Luv dat chicken...\" jingle, as well as the theme song (\"My Opinionation\") for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese's documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song \"Such a Night\") and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song \"New Orleans\").  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, \"Down in New Orleans\".\n\nIn January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "profile": "Malcolm John Rebennack (born November 20, 1941, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA - died June 6, 2019), better known by his stage name Dr. John, was an American singer and songwriter. His music combines blues, pop, jazz, boogie woogie and rock and roll.\r\n\r\nRebennack began playing the piano at the age of six and, as he grew up, he became strongly influenced by the style of [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1394017-Henry-Roeland-Byrd]Roy Byrd[/url] (aka Professor Longhair). He immersed himself in the music and voodoo cultures of New Orleans, where he became known as [a=Mac Rebennack], playing the organ in strip-clubs with 'make-up' bands in the French Quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was as a session guitarist with [a=John Vincent]'s Ace Records that gave him his first break, around 1957. He worked with the New Orleans R&B session crew at Crescent City's '[a=Cosimo V. Matassa]' studio and with an 'All For One' co-operative formed by [a=Harold Battiste]- cutting Storm Warning (Rex, 1957) and singles on Ace, Rex and AFO (an acronym of All For One) .\r\n\r\nRebennack then moved to California in 1962 with Battiste's crew, where they played on [a=Sam Cooke]'s final recording session. Rebennack subsequently undertook a lot of session work around LA (appearing briefly for a Freak Out! album session with [a=Frank Zappa]) and developed his Mardi Gras persona of Dr. John Creaux The Night Tripper with Battiste's help, assembling the Gris-Gris album whilst sessioning for [a=Sonny & Cher].\r\n\r\nHis drawled and ponderous style, tinged with a husky Southern Comfort delivery, caught the mood of the moment upon the album's release in 1968 giving him the commercial freedom to explore the many facets of the Louisiana blues and Memphis funk cultures in following releases. His recordings have been supported by such alumni as Clapton, Jagger, Allen Toussaint, The Meters, Jerry Wexler and Mike Bloomfield. He had a top-ten hit with Right Place, Wrong Time, and he appeared in the Martin Scorsese film The Last Waltz (1978).\r\n\r\nDr. John kept touring and releasing records. He unexpectedly passed away of a sudden, massive heart attack on June 6, 2019.",

        "profile": "Malcolm John Rebennack (born November 20, 1941, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA - died June 6, 2019), better known by his stage name Dr. John, was an American singer and songwriter. His music combines blues, pop, jazz, boogie woogie and rock and roll.\r\n\r\nRebennack began playing the piano at the age of six and, as he grew up, he became strongly influenced by the style of [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1394017-Henry-Roeland-Byrd]Roy Byrd[/url] (aka Professor Longhair). He immersed himself in the music and voodoo cultures of New Orleans, where he became known as [a=Mac Rebennack], playing the organ in strip-clubs with 'make-up' bands in the French Quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was as a session guitarist with [a=John Vincent]'s Ace Records that gave him his first break, around 1957. He worked with the New Orleans R&B session crew at Crescent City's '[a=Cosimo V. Matassa]' studio and with an 'All For One' co-operative formed by [a=Harold Battiste]- cutting Storm Warning (Rex, 1957) and singles on Ace, Rex and AFO (an acronym of All For One) .\r\n\r\nRebennack then moved to California in 1962 with Battiste's crew, where they played on [a=Sam Cooke]'s final recording session. Rebennack subsequently undertook a lot of session work around LA (appearing briefly for a Freak Out! album session with [a=Frank Zappa]) and developed his Mardi Gras persona of Dr. John Creaux The Night Tripper with Battiste's help, assembling the Gris-Gris album whilst sessioning for [a=Sonny & Cher].\r\n\r\nHis drawled and ponderous style, tinged with a husky Southern Comfort delivery, caught the mood of the moment upon the album's release in 1968 giving him the commercial freedom to explore the many facets of the Louisiana blues and Memphis funk cultures in following releases. His recordings have been supported by such alumni as Clapton, Jagger, Allen Toussaint, The Meters, Jerry Wexler and Mike Bloomfield. He had a top-ten hit with Right Place, Wrong Time, and he appeared in the Martin Scorsese film The Last Waltz (1978).\r\n\r\nDr. John kept touring and releasing records. He unexpectedly passed away of a sudden, massive heart attack on June 6, 2019.",

The winner of six Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011. He was variously known as Mac Rebennack, Dr. John Creaux, Dr. John, the Night Tripper.\n\nDr. John began making his own idiosyncratic music in the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (\"the lowest time of my life\"), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Dr. John, The Night Tripper. The name \"Dr. John\" came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.\n\nDr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits' \"Luv dat chicken...\" jingle, as well as the theme song (\"My Opinionation\") for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese's documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song \"Such a Night\") and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song \"New Orleans\").  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, \"Down in New Orleans\".\n\nIn January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
