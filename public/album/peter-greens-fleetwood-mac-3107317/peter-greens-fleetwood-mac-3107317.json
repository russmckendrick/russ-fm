      "biography": "Fleetwood Mac is a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood Mac was founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy Spencer, before bassist John McVie joined the lineup for their self-titled debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist Christine Perfect (later known as Christine McVie), who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970.\n\nPrimarily a British blues band, Fleetwood Mac scored a UK number one with \"Albatross\", and had other hits such as the singles \"Oh Well\" and \"Man of the World\". All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists Bob Welch and Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, all three of them had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band.\n\nThe addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, Fleetwood Mac, reached No. 1 in the United States. Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) separated while continuing to make music together.\n\nThe band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of Bill Clinton featured the lineup of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, The Dance (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of Rumours. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, Say You Will, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band and was replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House.\n\nFleetwood Mac has sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, the group was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998 the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nDanny Kirwan, guitarist, songwriter and early member of Fleetwood Mac (1968–1972) died in London, England, on 8 June 2018, aged 68. An obituary in The New York Times said he had died in his sleep after contracting pneumonia earlier in the year. The British music magazine Mojo quoted Christine McVie as saying: \"Danny Kirwan was the white English blues guy. Nobody else could play like him. He was a one-off ... Danny and Peter [Green] gelled so well together. Danny had a very precise, piercing vibrato – a unique sound ... He was a perfectionist; a fantastic musician and a fantastic writer.\" One of Kirwan's songs, \"Tell Me All the Things You Do\" from the 1970 album Kiln House, was included in the set of the 2018–19 An Evening with Fleetwood Mac tour.\n\nOn 28 May 2020 Neil Finn, featuring Nicks and McVie, with Campbell on guitar, released the song “Find Your Way Back Home” for the Auckland, New Zealand homeless shelter Auckland City Mission. \n\nFounding member Peter Green died on 25 July 2020 at the age of 73. In October 2020, Rumours again entered the Billboard top 10. The album received 30.6 million plays on streaming platforms the week of October 15, after a TikTok video of the song \"Dreams\" went viral.\n\nOn 30 November 2022, it was announced that  band member Christine McVie died at the age of 79, after a short illness.\n\nOn 18 June 2024, band member Stevie Nicks stated that there would be \"no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac together in anyway\" after the passing of Christine McVie. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "When Mick Fleetwood walked into Sound City studios in 1974, he wasn’t just looking for a place to record, he was looking for a place to start over. The band had lost four vocalists in as many years, and were on the wane both critically and commercially. So when producer Ken Olsen played Fleetwood an album by a middling folk-rock duo called Buckingham Nicks (just to test the sound), and Fleetwood liked the guitar playing, he figured, why not? Even when Buckingham said he and Nicks were a package deal, Fleetwood was unfazed: After all, they’d met, gotten along, and figured it might be interesting to have two female singer-songwriters in a band, not to mention two couples.\n\nWhy does <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> work so well? Balance. Fleetwood and John McVie—the band’s rhythm section—came from blues, but never quite crossed the threshold into hard rock, and they took to their new pop material without friction. Buckingham the chippy perfectionist (“Monday Morning”) is a foil for Nicks the mystic (“Rhiannon”), and Nicks the West Coast Earth mama (“Landslide”) a foil for Christine McVie the sophisticate (“Warm Ways”). Together they resolve the oxymoron not just of ”soft rock”, but of “folk pop”, creating, as though through spontaneous combustion, a sound commercial enough to sell millions, and personal enough to make those millions feel like the music is whispering something secret about their own lives.\n\nOn being reminded by John McVie that they were supposed to be a blues band, Olsen famously assured him that what they were doing now was a much faster way to the bank. But the beauty of the album’s creation is that nobody in the band seemed to expect it, and everyone shared in it equally. As Mick Fleetwood later put it, Buckingham Nicks didn’t join Fleetwood Mac—the two bands became one.",
