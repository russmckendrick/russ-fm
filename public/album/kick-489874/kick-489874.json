      "biography": "INXS are an Australian rock band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney, New South Wales. Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on guitar and keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone. For 20 years, INXS were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose \"sultry good looks\" and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.\nIn the early 1980s, INXS first charted in their native Australia with their debut self-titled album, but later garnered moderate success elsewhere with Shabooh Shoobah and a single, \"The One Thing\". Though The Swing brought more success from around the world, its single \"Original Sin\" was even greater commercially, becoming their first number-one single. They would later achieve international success with a series of hit recordings through later in the 1980s and the 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, and X; and the singles \"What You Need\", \"Need You Tonight\", \"Devil Inside\", \"New Sensation\", and \"Suicide Blonde\".\nIn the 1990s, INXS brought a new audience following Hutchence's romance with pop singer Kylie Minogue, and achieved greater acclaim in the UK. However, starting with Welcome to Wherever You Are, in 1992, they achieved less success in the United States. A depressed Hutchence committed suicide by hanging in 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year. They made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J.D. Fortune, and the release of \"Pretty Vegas\" and \"Afterglow\" as singles, and its album Switch. In late 2010, they recorded and released Original Sin, a tribute album, featuring guest artists such as Kavyen Temperley (of Eskimo Joe) and Ben Harper. In September 2011 the band announced that Northern Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin had replaced Fortune as their lead vocalist ahead of a planned tour of South America, Australia & Europe later in the year.\nINXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.",

            "content": "Kick is the sixth studio album by Australian rock band INXS, released on 19 October 1987. The album was produced by British producer Chris Thomas, recorded by David Nicholas in Sydney and Paris and mixed by Bob Clearmountain at AIR Studios in London.\n\nAfter the success of their fifth studio album, Listen Like Thieves (1985), and its second single \"What You Need\" (1986), INXS knew their new material would have to be even better, according to guitarist Kirk Pengilly, \"We wanted an album where all the songs were possible singles\". They recorded Kick in Sydney and Paris, it was produced by Chris Thomas again, but Atlantic Records was not happy with the result, as manager Chris Murphy remembers:\n\nThey hated it, absolutely hated it. They said there was no way they could get this music on rock radio. They said it was suited for black radio, but they didn't want to promote it that way. The president of the label told me that he'd give us $1 million to go back to Australia and make another album.\n\nDespite Atlantic's protests, Kick was released in October 1987 and provided the band with worldwide popularity; it peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 US singles, \"New Sensation\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\", \"Devil Inside\" and No. 1 \"Need You Tonight\". \"Need You Tonight\" peaked No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France. They toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track \"Mediate\" (which played after the video for \"Need You Tonight\") replicated the format of Bob Dylan's video for \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988 the band won 5 categories in the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\".\n\nIn 2002 Rhino Entertainment released a remastered reissue of 'Kick', with four previously unreleased bonus tracks. Mercury/Universal reissued the album in 2004 as part of their Deluxe Edition series of albums. The two-disc collection was bolstered by a disc of remixes, B-sides and outtakes. Kick is the band's best-selling album and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it as 6× Platinum, with shipments of six million units, in 1997. According to INXS: Story to Story: The Official Autobiography (2005) it has sold more than 10 million copies in the US alone. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/INXS/Kick\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was produced by British producer Chris Thomas, recorded by David Nicholas in Sydney and Paris and mixed by Bob Clearmountain at AIR Studios in London.\n\nAfter the success of their fifth studio album, Listen Like Thieves (1985), and its second single \"What You Need\" (1986), INXS knew their new material would have to be even better, according to guitarist Kirk Pengilly, \"We wanted an album where all the songs were possible singles\". They recorded Kick in Sydney and Paris, it was produced by Chris Thomas again, but Atlantic Records was not happy with the result, as manager Chris Murphy remembers:\n\nThey hated it, absolutely hated it. They said there was no way they could get this music on rock radio. They said it was suited for black radio, but they didn't want to promote it that way. The president of the label told me that he'd give us $1 million to go back to Australia and make another album.\n\nDespite Atlantic's protests, Kick was released in October 1987 and provided the band with worldwide popularity; it peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria. It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 US singles, \"New Sensation\", \"Never Tear Us Apart\", \"Devil Inside\" and No. 1 \"Need You Tonight\". \"Need You Tonight\" peaked No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France. They toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track \"Mediate\" (which played after the video for \"Need You Tonight\") replicated the format of Bob Dylan's video for \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988 the band won 5 categories in the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for \"Need You Tonight/Mediate\".\n\nIn 2002 Rhino Entertainment released a remastered reissue of 'Kick', with four previously unreleased bonus tracks. Mercury/Universal reissued the album in 2004 as part of their Deluxe Edition series of albums. The two-disc collection was bolstered by a disc of remixes, B-sides and outtakes. Kick is the band's best-selling album and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it as 6× Platinum, with shipments of six million units, in 1997. According to INXS: Story to Story: The Official Autobiography (2005) it has sold more than 10 million copies in the US alone. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/INXS/Kick\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
