      "biography": "Thomas Edward Yorke (born 7 October, 1968 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England) is best known as the lead singer of the English alternative rock band Radiohead. He has also recorded as a solo musician. His debut album, The Eraser, debuted July 10th 2006 in the UK and July 11th in the US. Two singles were released from the album, “Harrowdown Hill” and “Analyse”.\n\nYorke formed Atoms for Peace, who toured in 2010 performing the entirety of The Eraser. The rock ‘supergroup’ features Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, drummer Joey Waronker, and percussionist Mauro Refosco. \n\nThe song “Black Swan” was used as the end theme to the 2006 film adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s novel A Scanner Darkly and was also a successful hit on American alternative radio in the summer of 2006. “Analyse” was also used on the end credits of the film The Prestige. 2006 also saw the release of a Japan-only EP entitled Spitting Feathers, which collected together the five b-sides from the “Analyze” and “Harrowdown Hill” singles.\n\nA collection of remixes from The Eraser from such electronic luminaries as Burial, Four Tet, Modeselektor, Various Production and Surgeon were released as MP3 files initially in 2007, followed by a series of limited 12” in 2008. These were eventually released on CD as The Eraser Rmxs album.\n\nIn 2009, Yorke contributed a new song, “Hearing Damage”, to the soundtrack for The Twilight Saga: New Moon.\n\nHe mainly plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar and piano, but has also played drums and bass guitar (notably during the Kid A and Amnesiac Radiohead sessions).",

It was produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, with artwork by Radiohead artist Stanley Donwood. The album blends Yorke's vocals and piano playing with electronic beats and textures.\n\nYorke released Tomorrow's Modern Boxes independently via a paid-for BitTorrent bundle. He and Godrich expressed their wish to find \"an effective way of handing some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work\". The album was downloaded over a million times within six days of release, and became the most-downloaded legal torrent of 2014; by February 2015, it had been downloaded over 4.5 million times.\n\nA vinyl edition was also sold from the official site. On 26 December 2014, Yorke released Tomorrow's Modern Boxes on the online music shop Bandcamp alongside a new song described as an \"addendum to the album\", \"Youwouldn'tlikemewhenI'mangry\". The album received generally positive reviews and Rolling Stone named it one of the best of 2014. A CD edition was released in Japan in August 2015 by Hostess Entertainment, and it was reissued on physical formats worldwide in December 2017 by XL Recordings. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Thom+Yorke/Tomorrow%27s+Modern+Boxes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
