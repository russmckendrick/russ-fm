  "biography": "Bullet Height is a British electronic-rock duo consisting of members Jon Courtney, formerly of progressive rock band 'Pure Reason Revolution' and Sammi Doll of dark electronica act 'IAMX'. The band is based in Berlin, Germany where the pair met on Halloween night through producer Tom Bellamy (Cooper Temple Clause, Losers) and began their recording sessions shortly after.\n\n“I left London, moved to Berlin, rented a dirt-cheap room in an old DDR building & started battering out the music that would go on to become Bullet Height. I wanted to create something darker & heavier than ever before – I’d always written & produced in the past under no creative constraint & that has continued with this new band. From the first vocal session with Sammi I knew we were onto something\" Jon Courtney comments. \n\nThe band was signed to Superball Music in January 2016 and they have released two singles - \"Bastion\" and \"Hold Together\" in preparation for their debut album release set for spring 2017.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bullet+Height\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
