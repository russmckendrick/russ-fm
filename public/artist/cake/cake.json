  "biography": "Cake is an American alternative rock band from Sacramento, California. Consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Gabe Nelson and drummer Paulo Baldi, the band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and deadpan voice, DiFiore's trumpet parts, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip-hop.\nCake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Shon Meckfessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.\nProlonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release.",

Underground 70s pop/funk band\\n3.) 60s Girl pop band\\n\\n1.) Best-known for their ubiquitous hit \"The Distance,\" Cake epitomized the postmodern, irony-drenched aesthetic of \\'90s geek rock. Their sound freely mixed and matched pastiches of widely varying genres -- white-boy funk, hip-hop, country, new wave pop, jazz, college rock, and guitar rock -- with a particular delight in the clashes that resulted. Their songs were filled with lyrical non-sequiturs, pop-culture references, and smirky satire, all delivered with bone-dry detachment by speak/singing frontman John McCrea. Cake\\'s music most frequently earned comparisons to Soul Coughing and King Missile, but lacked the downtown New York artiness of those two predecessors; instead, Cake cultivated an image of average guys with no illusions and pretensions about their role as entertainers. At the same time, critics lambasted what they saw as a smugly superior attitude behind the band\\'s habitual sarcasm. Perhaps there was something in Cake\\'s doggedly spare, low-key presentation that amplified their ironic detachment even when they didn\\'t intend it, but most reviewers pegged them as one-hit wonders after the success of \"The Distance.\" Nonetheless, Cake managed a few more alternative radio hits in the years that followed, while largely retaining the same approach.\\n\\nCake was formed in Sacramento, California in 1991 by vocalist/songwriter John McCrea, who\\'d recently returned home after spending a few years in Los Angeles, unsuccessfully trying to break into the music business. The original lineup of Cake also featured guitarist Greg Brown, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, bassist Sean McFessel, and drummer Frank French; McFessel soon left to attend college, and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. In 1993, the band released their debut single, \"Rock ‘n\\' Roll Lifestyle,\" on a local basis, and followed it with a self-produced, self-released, self-distributed album, Motorcade of Generosity. Motorcade found its way to the revived Capricorn label, which released the album nationally after Cake signed a contract with them. With the prospect of extensive national touring, both Gabe Nelson and Frank French left the band, and were replaced by bassist Victor Damiani and drummer Todd Roper. Re-released by Capricorn, \"Rock ‘n\\' Roll Lifestyle\" caught on at college radio in 1995, and was followed by two more singles, \"Ruby Sees All,\" and \"Jolene\" (not the Dolly Parton song).\\n\\nCake\\'s second album, Fashion Nugget, was released in 1996 and spawned a breakout smash in the Greg Brown-penned \"The Distance,\" which dominated alternative radio that fall, and even turned into an unlikely sporting-event anthem. Mostly on the strength of \"The Distance,\" Fashion Nugget charted in the Top 40 and sold over a million copies. It also spun off a somewhat controversial follow-up single in a cover of Gloria Gaynor\\'s \"I Will Survive\"; although the band professed its sincere admiration for the song, some critics and listeners took it as a smarmy putdown, in part because of McCrea\\'s deadpan vocals. In 1997, Greg Brown and Victor Damiani both left Cake and formed a new group, the new wave-influenced Deathray, which eventually released its debut album on Capricorn in 2000. Meanwhile, McCrea briefly considered putting Cake to rest, but brought original bassist Gabe Nelson back to replace Damiani instead. For Cake\\'s next album, McCrea used a tag-team procession of guitarists -- five in all -- on different tracks; the result, Prolonging the Magic, was released in 1998. True to its sardonic title, it defied critical opinion to produce another big, alternative radio hit in \"Never There,\" plus decently successful follow-ups in \"Sheep Go to Heaven\" and \"Let Go.\"\\n\\nProlonging the Magic sold nearly as well as Fashion Nugget, and was also certified platinum. For the supporting tour, one of the album\\'s guitarists, Xan McCurdy, officially joined Cake full-time. In the spring of 2000, the band signed a new deal with Columbia, and debuted in 2001 with their fourth overall album, Comfort Eagle, which became their highest-charting yet (at number 13). The lead single, \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket,\" was a hit on alternative radio, and even earned some MTV airplay -- no longer an easy task for any artist -- with a video that featured reactions to the song by randomly selected people on the street. Following the completion of the album, drummer Todd Roper left the group to spend more time with his children, and was replaced on the supporting tour by Pete McNeal. Pressure Chief appeared in 2004. Redefining the meaning of independent -- the band was by then recording in a studio powered entirely by solar energy, and free of the corporate involvement of even so much as a utility bill -- released Showroom of Compassion some six years later in 2011.\\n\\nBiography by  Steve Huey\\n\\n2.

Perhaps there was something in Cake\\'s doggedly spare, low-key presentation that amplified their ironic detachment even when they didn\\'t intend it, but most reviewers pegged them as one-hit wonders after the success of \"The Distance.\" Nonetheless, Cake managed a few more alternative radio hits in the years that followed, while largely retaining the same approach.\\n\\nCake was formed in Sacramento, California in 1991 by vocalist/songwriter John McCrea, who\\'d recently returned home after spending a few years in Los Angeles, unsuccessfully trying to break into the music business. The original lineup of Cake also featured guitarist Greg Brown, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, bassist Sean McFessel, and drummer Frank French; McFessel soon left to attend college, and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. In 1993, the band released their debut single, \"Rock ‘n\\' Roll Lifestyle,\" on a local basis, and followed it with a self-produced, self-released, self-distributed album, Motorcade of Generosity. Motorcade found its way to the revived Capricorn label, which released the album nationally after Cake signed a contract with them. With the prospect of extensive national touring, both Gabe Nelson and Frank French left the band, and were replaced by bassist Victor Damiani and drummer Todd Roper. Re-released by Capricorn, \"Rock ‘n\\' Roll Lifestyle\" caught on at college radio in 1995, and was followed by two more singles, \"Ruby Sees All,\" and \"Jolene\" (not the Dolly Parton song).\\n\\nCake\\'s second album, Fashion Nugget, was released in 1996 and spawned a breakout smash in the Greg Brown-penned \"The Distance,\" which dominated alternative radio that fall, and even turned into an unlikely sporting-event anthem. Mostly on the strength of \"The Distance,\" Fashion Nugget charted in the Top 40 and sold over a million copies. It also spun off a somewhat controversial follow-up single in a cover of Gloria Gaynor\\'s \"I Will Survive\"; although the band professed its sincere admiration for the song, some critics and listeners took it as a smarmy putdown, in part because of McCrea\\'s deadpan vocals. In 1997, Greg Brown and Victor Damiani both left Cake and formed a new group, the new wave-influenced Deathray, which eventually released its debut album on Capricorn in 2000. Meanwhile, McCrea briefly considered putting Cake to rest, but brought original bassist Gabe Nelson back to replace Damiani instead. For Cake\\'s next album, McCrea used a tag-team procession of guitarists -- five in all -- on different tracks; the result, Prolonging the Magic, was released in 1998. True to its sardonic title, it defied critical opinion to produce another big, alternative radio hit in \"Never There,\" plus decently successful follow-ups in \"Sheep Go to Heaven\" and \"Let Go.\"\\n\\nProlonging the Magic sold nearly as well as Fashion Nugget, and was also certified platinum. For the supporting tour, one of the album\\'s guitarists, Xan McCurdy, officially joined Cake full-time. In the spring of 2000, the band signed a new deal with Columbia, and debuted in 2001 with their fourth overall album, Comfort Eagle, which became their highest-charting yet (at number 13). The lead single, \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket,\" was a hit on alternative radio, and even earned some MTV airplay -- no longer an easy task for any artist -- with a video that featured reactions to the song by randomly selected people on the street. Following the completion of the album, drummer Todd Roper left the group to spend more time with his children, and was replaced on the supporting tour by Pete McNeal. Pressure Chief appeared in 2004. Redefining the meaning of independent -- the band was by then recording in a studio powered entirely by solar energy, and free of the corporate involvement of even so much as a utility bill -- released Showroom of Compassion some six years later in 2011.\\n\\nBiography by  Steve Huey\\n\\n2.

      "biography_en": "Cake is an American alternative rock band from Sacramento, California. Consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Gabe Nelson and drummer Paulo Baldi, the band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and deadpan voice, DiFiore's trumpet parts, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip-hop.\nCake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Shon Meckfessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.\nProlonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release.",

      "biography_fr": "Cake (aussi typographié CAKE) est un groupe de rock alternatif américain formé à Sacramento (Californie) en 1991.\nBien que leur style musical soit la plupart du temps considéré comme de l'alternatif ou de l'indie rock, celui-ci est plutôt un mélange de nombreuses influences telles que le funk, le ska, le jazz, le rap et la country. Ce style particulier leur a valu d'être comparé à King Missile, Talking Heads, They Might Be Giants ou encore Soul Coughing.\nParmi leurs principaux succès on peut citer The Distance, Never There, Sheep Go to Heaven, Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle, No Phone, Short Skirt/Long Jacket ainsi que leur reprise de I Will Survive de Gloria Gaynor.\n\nLe groupe se forme en 1991 sous l'impulsion de John McCrea, qui cherche à percer depuis quelques années dans le milieu de la musique californienne. Il s'entoure du guitariste Greg Brown, du trompettiste Vincent Di Fiore, du bassiste Sean McFessel et du batteur Frank French. McFessel quitte rapidement le groupe pour se consacrer à ses études et est remplacé par Gabriel Nelson. En 1993, le single Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle commence à circuler dans les environs de Sacramento. Quelque temps plus tard, le groupe produit, édite et distribue lui-même son premier album Motorcade of Generosity. Une copie parvient aux studios Capricorn Records qui font signer le groupe et assurent une distribution nationale de l'album. French et Nelson quittent le groupe et sont remplacés respectivement par Victor Damiani et Todd Roper.\nLe second opus du groupe, Fashion Nugget, sort en 1996. Le single The Distance propulse le groupe sur le devant de la scène alternative. L'album est certifié platine et la popularité du groupe se confirme à la sortie du nouveau single I Will Survive. L'année suivante, Damiani et Brown quittent le groupe et forme un nouveau groupe, Deathray qui ne sortira pas son premier album avant l'an 2000.\nLa défection des deux musiciens est un coup dur pour la formation et McCrea envisage un temps de mettre un terme à l'aventure. Finalement, il décide de poursuivre et parvient à faire revenir Gabe Nelson, le bassiste de leurs débuts. Pour pallier le départ de Damiani, McCrea décide d'engager des guitaristes d'appoint (ils seront cinq au total) au gré des enregistrements. Le troisième album, Prolonging the Magic, est ainsi réalisé en 1998. L'album confirme à ses détracteurs que Cake n'est pas une formation moribonde et rencontre un succès comparable à Fashion Nugget. Les singles Never There, Sheep Go to Heaven et Let Me Go rencontrent un franc succès sur les radios alternatives. Pour la tournée promotionnelle qui suit, l'un des guitaristes d'appoint, Xan McCurdy intègre la formation à plein-temps.\nAu printemps 2000, Cake quitte Capricorn Records pour Columbia et sort l'année suivante son quatrième album Comfort Eagle. Sans doute l'album de la consécration, l'album se classe #13 dans les charts américains. Le single Short Skirt/Long Jacket connaît même quelques diffusions sur MTV. Le batteur Todd Roper quitte alors le groupe pour se consacrer à sa famille, il est remplacé par Pete McNeal lors de la tournée promotionnelle.\nCake a réalisé ensuite son cinquième album Pressure Chief. McNeal ne participe pas à l'enregistrement de l'album. Todd Roper, Matt McCord et Paulo Baldi assureront l'enregistrement de l'album en tant que musiciens invités et Baldi assurera également la tournée promotionnelle.\nL'album live Live at the Crystal Palace initialement prévu pour l'automne 2006, est repoussé à 2007.\nLeur single Short Skirt/Long Jacket est utilisé comme générique pour la série américaine Chuck ainsi que pour une publicité pour l'Ipod Nano d'Apple.",

      "biography_pt": "Cake (frequentemente escrito CAKE, em maiúsculas) é uma banda formada em 1991 em Sacramento, Califórnia. Tiveram vários sucessos nas décadas de 90 e 2000 e gravaram cinco álbuns.\n\nEmbora a música dos Cake seja freqüentemente classificada como rock alternativo, combina vários gêneros musicais como funk, ska, pop, jazz, rap e country. Marcas registradas dessa banda são as letras bem-humoradas e irônicas, as capas dos discos (bastante semelhantes), o trompete de Vince DiFiore e o estilo peculiar de John McCrea (voz, guitarra), que em vários momentos diz as letras, em vez de as cantar.\n\nJá houve diversas mudanças na formação dos Cake. Victor Damiani (baixo) deixou a banda em 1997, dando lugar a Gabe Nelson. Um ano depois, Greg Brown (guitarra) foi substituído por Xan McCurdy. Finalmente, Todd Roper (bateria) abandonou o grupo depois da gravação do quarto álbum, \"Comfort Eagle\", para priorizar seu filho. Depois da saída do Cake, Damiani e Brown continuaram a trabalhar juntos quando formando a banda Deathray.\n\nAlguns dos grandes sucessos desse grupo são \"Never There\", \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\", \"Frank Sinatra\" e uma cover inusitada de \"I Will Survive\", de Gloria Gaynor.\n\nO grupo anunciou que está a preparar dois discos, sendo um deles ao vivo (\"Live at the Crystal Palace\") e outro de raridades (\"B-Sides and Rarities\"), que incluirá covers de \"War Pigs\", do Black Sabbath, e \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", de Barry White.",

Following the completion of the album, drummer Todd Roper left the group to spend more time with his children, and was replaced on the supporting tour by Pete McNeal. Pressure Chief appeared in 2004. Redefining the meaning of independent -- the band was by then recording in a studio powered entirely by solar energy, and free of the corporate involvement of even so much as a utility bill -- released Showroom of Compassion some six years later in 2011.\n\nBiography by  Steve Huey\n\n2.

Best-known for their ubiquitous hit \"The Distance,\" Cake epitomized the postmodern, irony-drenched aesthetic of '90s geek rock. Their sound freely mixed and matched pastiches of widely varying genres -- white-boy funk, hip-hop, country, new wave pop, jazz, college rock, and guitar rock -- with a particular delight in the clashes that resulted. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cake\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

      "biography_en": "Cake is an American alternative rock band from Sacramento, California. Consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Gabe Nelson and drummer Paulo Baldi, the band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and deadpan voice, DiFiore's trumpet parts, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip-hop.\nCake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Shon Meckfessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.\nProlonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release.",

      "biography_fr": "Cake (aussi typographié CAKE) est un groupe de rock alternatif américain formé à Sacramento (Californie) en 1991.\nBien que leur style musical soit la plupart du temps considéré comme de l'alternatif ou de l'indie rock, celui-ci est plutôt un mélange de nombreuses influences telles que le funk, le ska, le jazz, le rap et la country. Ce style particulier leur a valu d'être comparé à King Missile, Talking Heads, They Might Be Giants ou encore Soul Coughing.\nParmi leurs principaux succès on peut citer The Distance, Never There, Sheep Go to Heaven, Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle, No Phone, Short Skirt/Long Jacket ainsi que leur reprise de I Will Survive de Gloria Gaynor.\n\nLe groupe se forme en 1991 sous l'impulsion de John McCrea, qui cherche à percer depuis quelques années dans le milieu de la musique californienne. Il s'entoure du guitariste Greg Brown, du trompettiste Vincent Di Fiore, du bassiste Sean McFessel et du batteur Frank French. McFessel quitte rapidement le groupe pour se consacrer à ses études et est remplacé par Gabriel Nelson. En 1993, le single Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle commence à circuler dans les environs de Sacramento. Quelque temps plus tard, le groupe produit, édite et distribue lui-même son premier album Motorcade of Generosity. Une copie parvient aux studios Capricorn Records qui font signer le groupe et assurent une distribution nationale de l'album. French et Nelson quittent le groupe et sont remplacés respectivement par Victor Damiani et Todd Roper.\nLe second opus du groupe, Fashion Nugget, sort en 1996. Le single The Distance propulse le groupe sur le devant de la scène alternative. L'album est certifié platine et la popularité du groupe se confirme à la sortie du nouveau single I Will Survive. L'année suivante, Damiani et Brown quittent le groupe et forme un nouveau groupe, Deathray qui ne sortira pas son premier album avant l'an 2000.\nLa défection des deux musiciens est un coup dur pour la formation et McCrea envisage un temps de mettre un terme à l'aventure. Finalement, il décide de poursuivre et parvient à faire revenir Gabe Nelson, le bassiste de leurs débuts. Pour pallier le départ de Damiani, McCrea décide d'engager des guitaristes d'appoint (ils seront cinq au total) au gré des enregistrements. Le troisième album, Prolonging the Magic, est ainsi réalisé en 1998. L'album confirme à ses détracteurs que Cake n'est pas une formation moribonde et rencontre un succès comparable à Fashion Nugget. Les singles Never There, Sheep Go to Heaven et Let Me Go rencontrent un franc succès sur les radios alternatives. Pour la tournée promotionnelle qui suit, l'un des guitaristes d'appoint, Xan McCurdy intègre la formation à plein-temps.\nAu printemps 2000, Cake quitte Capricorn Records pour Columbia et sort l'année suivante son quatrième album Comfort Eagle. Sans doute l'album de la consécration, l'album se classe #13 dans les charts américains. Le single Short Skirt/Long Jacket connaît même quelques diffusions sur MTV. Le batteur Todd Roper quitte alors le groupe pour se consacrer à sa famille, il est remplacé par Pete McNeal lors de la tournée promotionnelle.\nCake a réalisé ensuite son cinquième album Pressure Chief. McNeal ne participe pas à l'enregistrement de l'album. Todd Roper, Matt McCord et Paulo Baldi assureront l'enregistrement de l'album en tant que musiciens invités et Baldi assurera également la tournée promotionnelle.\nL'album live Live at the Crystal Palace initialement prévu pour l'automne 2006, est repoussé à 2007.\nLeur single Short Skirt/Long Jacket est utilisé comme générique pour la série américaine Chuck ainsi que pour une publicité pour l'Ipod Nano d'Apple.",

      "biography_pt": "Cake (frequentemente escrito CAKE, em maiúsculas) é uma banda formada em 1991 em Sacramento, Califórnia. Tiveram vários sucessos nas décadas de 90 e 2000 e gravaram cinco álbuns.\n\nEmbora a música dos Cake seja freqüentemente classificada como rock alternativo, combina vários gêneros musicais como funk, ska, pop, jazz, rap e country. Marcas registradas dessa banda são as letras bem-humoradas e irônicas, as capas dos discos (bastante semelhantes), o trompete de Vince DiFiore e o estilo peculiar de John McCrea (voz, guitarra), que em vários momentos diz as letras, em vez de as cantar.\n\nJá houve diversas mudanças na formação dos Cake. Victor Damiani (baixo) deixou a banda em 1997, dando lugar a Gabe Nelson. Um ano depois, Greg Brown (guitarra) foi substituído por Xan McCurdy. Finalmente, Todd Roper (bateria) abandonou o grupo depois da gravação do quarto álbum, \"Comfort Eagle\", para priorizar seu filho. Depois da saída do Cake, Damiani e Brown continuaram a trabalhar juntos quando formando a banda Deathray.\n\nAlguns dos grandes sucessos desse grupo são \"Never There\", \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\", \"Frank Sinatra\" e uma cover inusitada de \"I Will Survive\", de Gloria Gaynor.\n\nO grupo anunciou que está a preparar dois discos, sendo um deles ao vivo (\"Live at the Crystal Palace\") e outro de raridades (\"B-Sides and Rarities\"), que incluirá covers de \"War Pigs\", do Black Sabbath, e \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", de Barry White.",
