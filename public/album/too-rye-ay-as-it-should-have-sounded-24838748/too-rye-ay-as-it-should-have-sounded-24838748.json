      "biography": "Born Wolverhampton, England. Rowland's first group, Lucy & The Lovers, were influenced by Roxy Music and turned out to be short-lived. His next project, punk rock act The Killjoys, were slightly more successful, releasing the single \"Johnny Won't Go To Heaven\" in 1977. Alienated by the punk scene, Rowland, together with Killjoys guitarist, Al Archer, decided to form a new soul influenced group, Dexys Midnight Runners.  When Dexys disbanded in 1987, Rowland recorded a solo album called The Wanderer which, together with its three singles, was a commercial failure. His next release was not until 1999 when he recorded a collection of interpretations of classic songs called My Beauty, the album cover of which depicted a heavily made-up Rowland in a dress. This album was also a commercial and artistic failure.  In 2003, Rowland reformed Dexys Midnight Runners and embarked on a successful comeback tour backed up with a greatest hits album including two newly recorded songs, \"Manhood\" and \"My Life in England\". Both of these new songs were touted as new singles but, despite airplay on national radio, neither was commercially released.  Rowland recently launched his own MySpace site where he has promised a new Dexy's album soon and regularly writes blogs. A new song \"It's OK Johanna\" is already available on there. He also appeared as a DJ at the 2007 Big Chill festival.  All from Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rowland",

      "biography": "Dexys Midnight Runners (currently called Dexys) are an English pop group with soul influences, who achieved their major success in the early to mid 1980s. They are best known for their songs \"Come On Eileen\" and \"Geno\", both of which went No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. Kevin Rowland (vocals, guitar, at the time going under the pseudonym Carlo Rolan) and Kevin \"Al\" Archer (vocals, guitar), both previously of The Killjoys, founded the band in 1978 in Birmingham, England, naming the band after Dexedrine, a brand of dextroamphetamine popularly used as a recreational drug among Northern Soul fans at the time. The \"midnight runners\" referred to the energy the Dexedrine gave, enabling one to dance all night. \"Big\" Jim Paterson (trombone), Geoff \"JB\" Blythe (saxophone, previously of Geno Washington's Ram Jam Band), Steve \"Babyface\" Spooner (alto saxophone), Pete Saunders (keyboard), Pete Williams (bass) and Bobby \"Jnr\" Ward (drums) formed the first line-up of the band to record a single, \"Dance Stance\" (1979).\nThe song was released on the independent Oddball Records, was named \"single of the week\" by Sounds, and reached number 40 in the British charts, but the next single, \"Geno\" – about Geno Washington, and released on EMI – was a British Number One in 1980. It featured the band's newest recruits, Andy Leek (keyboards) and Andy \"Stoker\" Growcott (drums). At age 11, Rowland had been taken by his brother to see Washington perform live. The success of the song prompted Washington to make a return to live performance, and also saw the departure of Leek, who gave his reasons for leaving as \"Really hating being famous all of a sudden... Just because I've been on Top of the Pops doesn't mean I should get any more respect. I didn't want people asking for my autograph all of the time.\" The band at this time dressed in donkey jackets or leather coats and woolly hats, and had a look described as \"straight out of De Niro's Mean Streets\". Rowland said of the band's sound and look in January 1980: \"we didn't want to become part of anyone else's movement. We'd rather be our own movement\". Image was very important to the group, with Rowland commenting \"We wanted to be a group that looked like something...a formed group, a project, not just random\".",
