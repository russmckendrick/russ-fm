      "biography": "The Beach Boys is an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The original lineup included brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Known for their vocal harmonies and lyrics often centered on youth culture, the band drew influence from older pop vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and rhythm and blues. Under Brian Wilson's leadership, their music sometimes incorporated elements of classical and jazz, as well as experimental recording techniques.\n\nInitially managed by the Wilsons' father, Murry Wilson, the group gained national recognition in 1963 with the release of \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" The song marked the beginning of a series of top-ten singles associated with the \"California sound,\" a style reflecting themes of surfing, cars, and romance. The Beach Boys were among the few American bands to maintain commercial success during the British Invasion. Beginning with the 1965 album \"The Beach Boys Today!\", the band shifted focus from surf-themed content to more introspective lyrics and complex arrangements. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" and the single \"Good Vibrations\" were significant in establishing the group's reputation for musical innovation. Plans for a follow-up album, \"Smile,\" were abandoned in 1967, after which Brian Wilson reduced his involvement in the band.\n\nThe band's popularity in the United States declined in the late 1960s, and their work was often overlooked by contemporary music critics at the time. In the early 1970s, the group underwent a change in public perception and musical direction, with Carl Wilson assuming a leadership role. During the mid-1970s, the group increasingly focused on live performances and retrospective compilations. Dennis Wilson died in 1983, and Brian Wilson later distanced himself from the band. Following Carl Wilson's death from lung cancer in 1998, Mike Love obtained legal rights to tour under the group's name. In the early 2010s, the surviving original members briefly reunited for a 50th anniversary tour. As of the 2020s, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine do not perform with the touring version of the Beach Boys led by Mike Love, though they are still officially considered members.\n\nThe Beach Boys have sold over 100 million records globally. Their work has had an influence on a variety of musical genres, including psychedelia, power pop, progressive rock, punk, alternative, and lo-fi. From the 1960s through the 2020s, the group achieved 37 Top 40 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, including four number-one hits. In 2004, they were ranked number 12 on Rolling Stone's list of the greatest artists of all time. Albums such as \"The Beach Boys Today!\", \"Pet Sounds,\" \"Smiley Smile,\" \"Sunflower,\" and \"Surf's Up\" have been frequently cited in critics' polls. The original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Additional members over the years have included David Marks, Bruce Johnston, Blondie Chaplin, and Ricky Fataar.\n\nOn June 11th 2025, Brian Wilson died at the age of 82.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys\n\nStudio albums\nSurfin' Safari (1962)\nSurfin' U.S.A.
