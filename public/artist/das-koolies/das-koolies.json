  "biography": "Updated and backdated, Das Koolies’ genesis lies in the nineties, half-a-decade between chapters and subject of rumour ever since. Super Furry Animals’ first gig, in Bangor in 1994, was a 30-second, chemically- and technologically-compromised flash of light, a set of techno-indebted electronica curtailed that could have altered history’s course. Onwards to Real World studios in 1998 and the recording of the classic, semi-experimental Furries’ album, Guerrilla and Das Koolies reconvene between World Cup goals and label meetings to go off-piste and quietly resuscitate their ideals of the early-90’s.\n\nThe band was then boxed and stored safely for reanimation.\n\nFinding that the through-road was a diversion, Das Koolies’ 2023 reformation, return to the studio and schedule of releases establishes a democratic artistic state, setting free ministries of music, performance and visual art in line with the members’ original vision. The Condemned and all tracks from the forthcoming EP were produced by Das Koolies and mixed in collaboration with Chris Shaw (Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Run-DMC).\n\nIn a brief statement, Das Koolies say: “Everything for a reason and a reason for everything.
