      "biography": "Ministry was formed in Chicago, Illinois, United States in 1981 by Alain Jourgensen (born Oct. 8, 1958, Havana, Cuba), who had previously been in a new wave band called Special Affect (fronted by future My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult leader Frankie Nardiello, aka Groovie Mann).\n\nWith drummer Stephen George, Ministry debuted with the Wax Trax! single Cold Life, which -- typical of their early output -- was in the synthpop dance style of new wavers like the Human League and Thompson Twins. The album With Sympathy, on the label Arista in 1983, followed a similar musical direction -- one that Jourgensen was dissatisfied with. He returned to Wax Trax! and recorded several singles while rethinking the band's style and forming his notorious side project, the Revolting Cocks.\n\nIn 1986, with Jourgensen the only official member of Ministry, the Adrian Sherwood-produced Twitch was released by Sire Records. While not as aggressive as the group's later material, it took definite steps in that direction with a more industrial / ebm sound. \n\nFollowing a 1987 single with Skinny Puppy's Kevin Ogilvie (aka Nivek Ogre) as PTP, Jourgensen once again revamped Ministry, with former Blackouts bassist Paul Barker officially joining the lineup to complement Jourgensen's rediscovery of the guitar. Fellow ex-Blackouts William Rieflin (drums) and Mike Scaccia (guitar), as well as vocalist Chris Connelly, were heavily showcased as collaborators for the first of several times on 1988's The Land of Rape and Honey. With Jourgensen and Barker credited as Hypo Luxa and Hermes Pan, respectively, this album proved to be Ministry's stylistic breakthrough, a taut, explosive fusion of heavy metal, industrial dance beats, samples and punk aggression. \n\n1989's The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste built on its predecessor's artistic success, and In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up was recorded on its supporting tour, introducing collaborators like drummer Martin Atkins (ex-Public Image Ltd., later of Pigface), guitarist William Tucker, and Jello Biafra). Jourgensen embarked on a flurry of side projects, including the Revolting Cocks (with Barker, Barker's brother Roland, Front 242 members Luc Van Acker and Richard 23, and many more), 1000 Homo DJs (with Biafra, Rieflin, and Trent Reznor), Acid Horse (with Cabaret Voltaire), Pailhead (with Ian MacKaye), and Lard (with Biafra, Barker and Rieflin).\n\nIn late 1991, Ministry issued the single Jesus Built My Hotrod, a driving rocker featuring manic nonsense vocals by co-writer Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers; its exposure on MTV helped build anticipation for the following year's full-length Psalm 69 (subtitled The Way to Succeed & the Way to Suck Eggs, although the only title that appears on the album consists of a few Greek letters and symbols). The record reached the Top 30 and went platinum, producing two further MTV hits, N.W.O. and Just One Fix. Ministry consolidated its following with a spot on the second Lollapalooza tour that summer, joined by guitarist Louis Svitek. However, drug and legal problems sidelined the band in the wake of its newfound popularity, resulting in the clouded Filth Pig being released in 1995, too late to capitalize on their prior success. \n\nMore problems with drugs and arrests followed, and Jourgensen returned to some of his side projects, recording a new album with Lard, among others. In 1999, the single Bad Blood was featured prominently in the sci-fi blockbuster The Matrix, setting the stage for the release of Dark Side of the Spoon (the title a reference to the band's heroin problems) later that summer. \n\nGuitarist William Tucker committed suicide in May 1999. \n\nThe band was nominated for a Grammy in 2000 for \"Bad Blood,\" but they lost to Black Sabbath, and were dropped from Warner Bros. around the same time. They were also added to the Ozzfest tour but were kicked off before it began because of a management change. To compound their sorrows, Ipecac Records announced three live albums to be released, with material from the Psalm 69 tour being the main focus, but when Warner Bros. caught wind of the project they stamped it out, despite the CDs already being ready for printing. \n\nIn 2001, the band filmed a scene for Steven Spielberg's A.I. and released the song from the film on a greatest-hits album, appropriately titled Greatest Fits. The group signed to Sanctuary Records later in the year. They released the Sphinctour album and DVD in the spring of 2002 to satisfy fans who were disappointed by the Ipecac situation. The next spring, Animositisomina was released, advertised as a return to the Psalm 69 style of songwriting, and featuring a cover of Magazine's The Light Pours Out of Me. \n\nBarker left the Ministry camp in 2003. He stated that the trigger was his father dying while the band was wrapping up a summer tour in Europe, and also stated in early 2004 that his family life was his main focus at that particular time. Jourgensen continued Ministry with Mike Scaccia and various other musicians.\n\nHouses of the Molé followed in June 2004. It was the first part in a trilogy of \"anti-Bush\" albums (Rio Grande Blood in 2006 and The Last Sucker in 2007).\n\nIn September 2005 Ministry celebrated their 25th anniversary with Rantology. Jourgensen remixed such hits as Jesus Built My Hotrod and N.W.O. for the set, which also included live material, rarities, and the new track The Great Satan. An extensive tour with the newly reformed Revolting Cocks followed.\n\nIn 2007, after nearly three decades, nearly a dozen studio albums, and four Grammy nominations, Ministry announced that the album The Last Sucker would be its last. The album completed an uber-critical trilogy aimed at exposing the foils, failures and fabrications of the George W. Bush administration. Ministry embarked on its \"final\" world tour in the spring of 2008 – the “C U LaTour.”\n\nJourgenson then concentrated on running his label, 13th Planet Records. Three post-break-up Ministry albums were released: The Last Dubber, a remix album of  The Last Sucker; Cover Up, a compilation of new and old cover versions by Ministry; and Adios, a live album documenting the \"C U LaTour\".\n\nOn August 7, 2011, it was announced that Ministry was reforming and would play at Germany's Wacken Open Air festival, set to take place August 2-4, 2012. The reunion lineup featured Jourgensen on vocals, Scaccia and Tommy Victor both on guitar, Aaron Rossi on drums, John Bechdel on keyboards and Tony Campos on bass.\n\nJourgensen told Metal Hammer in August 2011 that Ministry had been working on a new album called Relapse. \"Bush is gone, so it's time for something new,\" he said. \"I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I've ever done.\"\n\nMinistry announced on their website that they entered the studio on September 1, 2011 with engineer Sammy D'Ambruoso to begin recording their new album. On December 23, 2011, Ministry released \"99%\", the first single from Relapse.  The album was released on March 23, 2012.\n\nOn December 23, 2012, guitarist Mike Scaccia died following an on-stage heart attack, while playing with his other band, Rigor Mortis.\n\nIn an interview with Noisey in March 2013, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would break up again, explaining that he does not want to carry on without Scaccia. \"Mikey was my best friend in the world and there's no Ministry without him\", he said. \"But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. So yes, this will be Ministry's last album.\" \n\nThe album, titled From Beer to Eternity, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen has stated that Ministry plans to tour in support of From Beer to Eternity, but will not record any more albums.\n\nCurrent Members:\nAl Jourgensen – vocals, keyboards, synths, guitar, bass, drums, and various others (1981–present)\nJohn Bechdel – keyboards (2006–2008, 2011–present)\nSin Quirin – guitars, bass (2007–2008, 2012–present)\nAaron Rossi – drums (2007–2008, 2011–present)\nCasey Orr – bass, keyboards (2012–present)\n\nFormer Members:\nJohn Davis – keyboards (1981–1982)\nStephen George – drums (1981–1985)\nRobert Roberts – keyboards (1981–1984)\nMarty Sorenson – bass (1981–1982)\nShay Jones – vocals (1982–1983)\nBrad Hallen – bass (1983–1985)\nJohn Soroka – keyboards/collaboration (1984–1986)\nPaul Barker – bass, keyboards, programming, vocals (1986–2003)\nBill Rieflin – drums, keyboards, programming, guitar (1986–1995)\nChris Connelly – vocals, keyboards & various songwriting credits (1987–1993)\nNivek Ogre – vocals, guitar, keyboards (1988–1990)\nMike Scaccia – guitars, bass (1989–1995, 2003–2006, 2011–2012)\nHowie Beno – programming, editing (1990–1993)\nMichael Balch – keyboards, programming (1991–1992)\nLouis Svitek – guitar (1992–1999, 2003)\nDuane Buford – keyboards (1995–1999)\nZlatko Hukic – electronics, guitar (1995–1999)\nRey Washam – drums, percussion, programming (1995–1999, 2003)\nMax Brody – drums, percussion, programming, saxophone (1999–2004)\nMark Baker – drums (2004–2005)\nJohn Monte – bass (2004)\nPaul Raven – bass, keyboards, guitar, drums (2005–2007)\nTommy Victor – guitars, bass (2005–2008, 2011–2012)\nTony Campos – bass (2007–2008, 2011–2012)\n\nDiscography (Studio albums):\n1983 - With Sympathy\n1986 - Twitch\n1988 - The Land of Rape and Honey\n1989 - The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste\n1992 - ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ (Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs)\n1996 - Filth Pig\n1999 - Dark Side of the Spoon\n2003 - Animositisomina\n2004 - Houses of the Molé\n2006 - Rio Grande Blood\n2007 - The Last Sucker\n2012 - Relapse\n2013 - From Beer to Eternity\n2018 - AmeriKKKant\n2021 - Moral Hygiene\n2024 - HOPIUMFORTHEMASSES <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ministry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs is the fifth studio album by industrial metal band Ministry, released in 1992 on Sire Records. \n\nThe actual title of the album is ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ (a Greek word roughly pronounced as \"ke-fa-lee,\" meaning \"head\" or \"leader,\" and the number 69 in Greek numerals), though Psalm 69 is used for simplicity's sake. The album lead them into a more mainstream audience, with the track Jesus Built My Hotrod (featuring guest vocals by Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers) receiving major airplay on MTV and various other music stations in the early 90's. It also marked Ministry's first release with guitarist Mike Scaccia, who was recruited by band frontman and founder Al Jourgensen in 1989.\n\nThe title of the album is directly linked to chapter 69 of The Book of Lies, a written work of Aleister Crowley, where he uses the expression \"The way to succeed and the way to suck eggs\" as a pun for the 69 sex position (\"suck seed\" and \"suck eggs\"). Moreover, Crowley titled the chapter ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ, Greek κεφαλη or \"head\" and ΞΘ or \"69\" (both slang in English for oral sex - but not the original ancient Greek words). There is no direct link to the Old Testament passage Psalm 69.\n\nSubsequent to the album's release, Ministry put multiple references to the number 69 in future albums. For example, the albums Dark Side of the Spoon and Houses of the Molé both had hidden tracks with a track number of 69.\n\nN.W.O. was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1993, but lost to Nine Inch Nails' Wish. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ministry/%CE%9A%CE%95%CE%A6%CE%91%CE%9B%CE%97%CE%9E%CE%98\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs is the fifth studio album by industrial metal band Ministry, released in 1992 on Sire Records. \n\nThe actual title of the album is ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ (a Greek word roughly pronounced as \"ke-fa-lee,\" meaning \"head\" or \"leader,\" and the number 69 in Greek numerals), though Psalm 69 is used for simplicity's sake. The album lead them into a more mainstream audience, with the track Jesus Built My Hotrod (featuring guest vocals by Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers) receiving major airplay on MTV and various other music stations in the early 90's. It also marked Ministry's first release with guitarist Mike Scaccia, who was recruited by band frontman and founder Al Jourgensen in 1989.\n\nThe title of the album is directly linked to chapter 69 of The Book of Lies, a written work of Aleister Crowley, where he uses the expression \"The way to succeed and the way to suck eggs\" as a pun for the 69 sex position (\"suck seed\" and \"suck eggs\"). Moreover, Crowley titled the chapter ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ, Greek κεφαλη or \"head\" and ΞΘ or \"69\" (both slang in English for oral sex - but not the original ancient Greek words). There is no direct link to the Old Testament passage Psalm 69.\n\nSubsequent to the album's release, Ministry put multiple references to the number 69 in future albums. For example, the albums Dark Side of the Spoon and Houses of the Molé both had hidden tracks with a track number of 69.\n\nN.W.O. was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1993, but lost to Nine Inch Nails' Wish. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ministry/%CE%9A%CE%95%CE%A6%CE%91%CE%9B%CE%97%CE%9E%CE%98\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
