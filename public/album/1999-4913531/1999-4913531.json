      "biography": "Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016), known by his mononym Prince, was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and actor, serving as a major figure in popular music for over three decades. Prince was renowned as an innovator and was widely known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, and wide vocal range. He was widely regarded as the pioneer of Minneapolis sound. His music combined rock, R&B, soul, funk, hip hop, disco, psychedelia, jazz, and pop.\n\nPrince was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age seven. After recording songs with his cousin's band 94 East, 19-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes before releasing his debut album For You in 1978, under the guidance of manager Owen Husney. His 1979 album Prince went platinum due to the success of the singles \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". His next three records—Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982)—continued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of elements of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name. A prolific songwriter, Prince in the 1980s wrote songs for and produced work by many other acts, often under pseudonyms.\n\nAfter releasing the albums Around the World in a Day (1985) and Parade (1986), The Revolution disbanded and Prince released the critically acclaimed double album Sign \"O\" the Times (1987) as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. He changed his stage name in 1993 to an unpronounceable symbol, also known as the \"Love Symbol\". He then began releasing new albums at a faster pace to remove himself from contractual obligations to Warner Bros.; he released five records between 1994 and 1996 before signing with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as \"Prince\" again. He released 15 albums since then, including his latest, HITnRUN Phase One, which was first released exclusively on the Tidal streaming service on September 7, 2015 before being released on CD on September 15, 2015 by NPG Records.\n\nPrince sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He won seven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year of his eligibility. Rolling Stone has ranked Prince at number 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nHe died at his Paisley Park recording studio and home in Chanhassen, Minnesota, near Minneapolis, on April 21, 2016, after suffering flu-like symptoms for several weeks.",

      "editorial_notes": "Heading into his fifth studio album in five years, Prince was already flexing his prolific powers—not just as a solo artist, but also as the mastermind behind several other Minneapolis groups, all of which allowed the Purple One to express his seemingly boundless creativity: In 1982 alone, Prince oversaw the release of Vanity 6’s self-titled debut album, played extensively on The Time’s sophomore hit <i>What Time Is It?</i> and released the double-disc classic <i>1999</i>—a visionary statement that, in many ways, was truly 17 years ahead of its time.\n\nBuilding on the mix of foreboding funk and blunt social statements he employed on 1980’s <i>Dirty Mind</i> and 1981’s <i>Controversy</i>, the future-shocked <i>1999</i> took Prince’s music—and message—to the masses, becoming his first album to land in the Top 10 of the Billboard Album charts. And this party manifesto spawned the singer’s biggest hits to date, including the apocalyptic title tune, the euphoric “Little Red Corvette” and the giddy, bopping, synth-driven “Delirious”.\n\nThe success of those three tracks—in particular “Little Red Corvette” and “Delirious”—would eventually land Prince his <i>Purple Rain</i> movie deal. Yet they’re just the opening tracks on this lengthy classic, which finds Prince’s genius in full flight. <i>1999</i> features the anthemic mantra of “D.M.S.R.”, the conscious soul of “Free”, the jazzy funk of “Lady Cab Driver” and the libidinous lift-off of “International Lover”. But the album also found Prince evolving beyond his one-man-band beginnings, setting the stage for the Revolution era to come on <i>Purple Rain</i>, with Prince getting musical input from such skillful musicians as Lisa Coleman, Wendy Melvoin, Dez Dickerson and Bobby Z. By the end of the millennium, “1999” would be played nonstop—and while it may have seemed in that moment the world had finally caught up to Prince, in truth, he was <i>always</i> a few years ahead of us.",

          "short": "A hit-packed double album that’ll leave you delirious.",
          "standard": "Heading into his fifth studio album in five years, Prince was already flexing his prolific powers—not just as a solo artist, but also as the mastermind behind several other Minneapolis groups, all of which allowed the Purple One to express his seemingly boundless creativity: In 1982 alone, Prince oversaw the release of Vanity 6’s self-titled debut album, played extensively on The Time’s sophomore hit <i>What Time Is It?</i> and released the double-disc classic <i>1999</i>—a visionary statement that, in many ways, was truly 17 years ahead of its time.\n\nBuilding on the mix of foreboding funk and blunt social statements he employed on 1980’s <i>Dirty Mind</i> and 1981’s <i>Controversy</i>, the future-shocked <i>1999</i> took Prince’s music—and message—to the masses, becoming his first album to land in the Top 10 of the Billboard Album charts. And this party manifesto spawned the singer’s biggest hits to date, including the apocalyptic title tune, the euphoric “Little Red Corvette” and the giddy, bopping, synth-driven “Delirious”.\n\nThe success of those three tracks—in particular “Little Red Corvette” and “Delirious”—would eventually land Prince his <i>Purple Rain</i> movie deal. Yet they’re just the opening tracks on this lengthy classic, which finds Prince’s genius in full flight. <i>1999</i> features the anthemic mantra of “D.M.S.R.”, the conscious soul of “Free”, the jazzy funk of “Lady Cab Driver” and the libidinous lift-off of “International Lover”. But the album also found Prince evolving beyond his one-man-band beginnings, setting the stage for the Revolution era to come on <i>Purple Rain</i>, with Prince getting musical input from such skillful musicians as Lisa Coleman, Wendy Melvoin, Dez Dickerson and Bobby Z. By the end of the millennium, “1999” would be played nonstop—and while it may have seemed in that moment the world had finally caught up to Prince, in truth, he was <i>always</i> a few years ahead of us."

            "content": "1999 is the fifth album by Prince, released on October 27, 1982. It was his first top ten album on the Billboard 200 charts in the United States (peaking at number 9) and became the fifth best-selling album of 1983. 1999 was Prince's breakthrough album, but his next album Purple Rain would become his most successful.\n\nAccording to the Rolling Stone Album Guide, \"1999 may be Prince's most influential album: Its synth-and-drum machine-heavy arrangements codified the 'Minneapolis sound' that loomed over mid-'80s R&B and pop, not to mention the next two decades' worth of electro, house, and techno.\" In 2003, the TV network VH1 placed 1999 forty-ninth in its list of the greatest albums of all time. The album was also part of Slant Magazine's list \"The 50 Most Essential Pop Albums\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nThe album's critical and commercial success secured Prince a place in the public psyche, and marked the beginning of two years of intense activity which, via massively successful tours, hit singles and a Hollywood movie, would make Prince arguably the biggest musical star on the planet next to Michael Jackson. In 2003, the album was ranked number 163 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\n\nOriginally released on vinyl as a double LP (the first of a number of double sets from Prince), 1999 was cut to a single vinyl edition in some countries; Brazil, for example, opted to issue the release as two separate vinyl albums, 1999 and 1999 II. The original compact disc version of the album was also cut, omitting \"D.M.S.R.\". There is a disclaimer on the back cover of the original compact disc pressing that reads \"To enable the release of 1999 as a single compact disc, the song DMSR has been omitted from the original LP edition\". Later compact disc pressings included the track. Also, on the cassette release, \"Free\" was placed after \"D.M.S.R.\" to end the first side, balancing out the lengths of both sides of the cassette.\n\nThe album's opening title track, \"1999\", was also its first single, initially peaking at 44 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was later re-released, hitting number 12 on the Billboard charts once interest in the album had caught fire with the release of 1999's second single, \"Little Red Corvette\", which peaked at Number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and heralded Prince's rise to superstardom. The music video for the song was significant in itself as one of the first videos by a black artist to receive \"heavy rotation\" airplay on the newly launched music video channel, MTV. The two tracks were later combined as a double A-side single in the UK, peaking at number 2. A third single, \"Delirious\", still managed Top Ten status in the US, but a fourth, \"Let's Pretend We're Married\", got no further than number 52.\n\nWhile \"Little Red Corvette\" helped Prince cross over to the wider rock audience, the rest of the album retains the elements of previous albums and is dominated by funk and synthesizer dance tracks. The album is, however, notable amongst Prince's catalogue for its wide variety of imagery and themes besides the sexual themes that had already become something of a trademark on previous albums. \"Automatic\", extending to almost ten minutes, starts side three of the album with a cocktail of synthesizers and bawdy bondage-inspired lyrical imagery which, transplanted to the music video for the track (with a scene that depicted Prince being tied up and whipped by band-members Lisa Coleman and Jill Jones), was, in 1983, considered too hot for MTV. \"Free\" is a delicate piano ballad expressing patriotism, and how fellow Americans should appreciate their freedom, while \"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)\", an ode to a harsh lover, is the centerpiece of a preoccupation with Computer Age themes that would continue into future albums. This \"computer\" theme is also reflected in the album's instrumentation, with Prince fully embracing the gadgetry and sounds of emergent electro-funk and '80's sequencing technology on tracks like \"Let's Pretend We're Married\" and \"All the Critics Love U in New York\", songs that widen his use of synthesizers and effects and prominently feature his noted uses of the Linn drum machine. Prince himself admitted at the time the movie Blade Runner was an influence on the album's synth sound and look in the music videos for the album.\n\n\nThe album's cover features elements from the front cover of Prince's previous album, Controversy; namely the eyes and the \"Rude Boy\" pin in the \"1999\", the jacket studs in the \"R\" and the smile in the \"P\". The \"I\" in Prince, in addition to being an obvious phallic symbol, also contains the words \"and the Revolution\" written backwards, both acknowledging his backing band and foreshadowing the next four years of his career.\n\nOne particular interesting fact about the ballad \"Free\" was, that fans have created myths that Prince is crying towards the end of the ballad. His voice can be heard getting very choked up around the 3:05 mark. This might be due to the fact that the song is well-meaning and emotional. In 2007, while performing the song Prince was said to have gotten emotional. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Prince/1999\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
