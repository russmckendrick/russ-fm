  "biography": "The Velvet Underground were an American rock band formed in New York City. First active from 1964 to 1973, their best-known members were Lou Reed and John Cale, who both went on to find success as solo artists. Although experiencing little commercial success while together, the band is often cited by many critics as one of the most important and influential groups of the 1960s. An often-repeated statement, usually attributed to Brian Eno or Peter Buck, is that \"The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band.\"\nAndy Warhol managed the Velvet Underground and it was the house band at his studio, the Factory, and his Exploding Plastic Inevitable events. The provocative lyrics of some of the band's songs gave a nihilistic outlook to some of their music.\nTheir 1967 debut album, titled The Velvet Underground & Nico (which featured German singer Nico, with whom the band collaborated) was named the 13th Greatest Album of All Time, and the \"most prophetic rock album ever made\" by Rolling Stone in 2003. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the band #19 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, by Patti Smith.",

It originally comprised singer and guitarist Lou Reed, Welsh multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus MacLise. In 1965 MacLise was replaced by Moe Tucker, who played on most of the band\\'s recordings. Though their integration of rock and the avant-garde resulted in little commercial success, they became one of the most influential bands in rock, underground, experimental, and alternative music. \\n\\n“The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band!” — Brian Eno.\\n\\nKnown by many as \"The Velvets\", the band was formed in New York City and first active from 1965 to 1973. Their best-known lineup consisted of vocalist/guitarist Lou Reed, bassist/violist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker. The band also collaborated with Nico for their debut album in 1967, under the supervision of producer and pop artist Andy Warhol. \\n\\nSome see The Velvet Underground as being a bridge between the pacifist themes of the late 60s and the sheer chaos and indifference of the mid-70s punk movement. \\n\\nThe Velvet Underground was one of the first rock music groups to experiment heavily with the form by incorporating avant-garde influences. The group\\'s often raw, sometimes difficult sound would influence many later punk, noise rock, and alternative music performers, and singer Lou Reed\\'s lyrics brought new levels of social realism and sleaze to rock. Critics Scott Isler and Ira Robbins argue that \"The Velvet Underground marked a turning point in rock history. After the release of The Velvet Underground & Nico knowing the power of which it was capable, the music could never be as innocent, as unselfconscious as before.\" \\n\\nPre-history (1964-1965) \\n\\nThe foundations for what would become The Velvet Underground were laid in late 1964. Lou Reed had performed with a few short-lived garage bands and had worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, a job Reed described as \"a poor man\\'s Carole King\". Reed met John Cale, a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music. Cale had worked with John Cage and La Monte Young, but was also interested in rock music. (Young\\'s use of extended drones would be a profound influence on the early Velvet\\'s sound). The pair rehearsed and performed together, and their partnership and shared interests steered the early direction of what would become the Velvet Underground.\\n\\nReed\\'s first group with Cale was the short-lived The Primitives, assembled to support a Reed-penned single, \"The Ostrich\". Reed and Cale recruited Sterling Morrison – a college classmate of Reed\\'s who had already played with him a few times – to play guitar, and Angus MacLise to play percussion. This quartet was first called The Warlocks, then The Falling Spikes.\\n\\nWhile moving into his New York City apartment Reed found the book The Velvet Underground by Michael Leigh, a book about sadomasochism, left by previous tenant Tony Conrad. Reed and Morrison have reported the group liked the name, considering it evocative of \"underground cinema,\" and fitting, due to Reed\\'s already having written \"Venus In Furs\", inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch\\'s book of the same name, also dealing with sadomasochism. The band immediately and unanimously adopted the book\\'s title for its new name.\\n\\nEarly stages (1965-1966)\\n\\nThe newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of beatnik poetry, with MacLise playing gentle \"pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone\".\\n\\nIn July of 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a demo tape. When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale gave a copy of the tape to Marianne Faithfull, hoping she\\'d pass it on to Mick Jagger. Nothing ever came of the demo. The demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See.\\n\\nWhen the group accepted an offer of $75 for their first paying performance at Summit High School, in Summit, NJ, MacLise left the group, protesting what he considered a sell out. \"Angus was in it for art\", Morrison reported.\\n\\nMacLise was replaced by Maureen Tucker, Jim Tucker\\'s younger sister. Tucker\\'s abbreviated drum kit was rather unusual: She generally played on tom toms and an upturned bass drum, using mallets rather than drumsticks, and she rarely used cymbals. The band having asked her to \\'do something unusual\\', she turned her bass drum on its side, and played standing up. When her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans, brought in from outside. Her driving rhythms were at once simple yet exotic, influenced by Babatunde Olatunji and Bo Diddley records, and became an essential part of the group\\'s music. The group earned a regular paying gig at a club, and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble.\\n\\nWhile the American west coast was undergoing the Summer of Love, psychedelia and flower power, the typically east coast Velvets concerned themselves with darker subject matter: transvestites, heroin addiction, and sadomasochism. Also setting them apart from their contemporaries was their use of feedback and amplifier noise in a musical context, exemplified by the seventeen minute track \"Sister Ray\" from their White Light/White Heat album.\\n\\nAndy Warhol and the Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable (1966-1967)\\n\\nAndy Warhol became the band\\'s manager in 1965, and suggested they feature the German-born singer Nico on several songs. Warhol\\'s reputation certainly helped the band gain a higher profile. Though Reed eventually fired Warhol, he praised the integrity of his early efforts with the group. Warhol helped the band land a coveted recording contract with MGM\\'s Verve Records, with himself as nominal \\'producer\\', and gave the Velvets unprecedented free reign over the sound they created.\\n\\nDuring their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable., for which they provided the musical part. This show played a couple of months in New York City, then took to the road all over the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967.\\n\\nIn 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few E.P.I. shows when Reed was suffering from hepatitis and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ and Tucker switched to bass guitar. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed \"The Booker T\", after the leader of the musical group Booker T & the MG\\'s; the jam later became the music for \"The Gift\" on White Light/White Heat. Some of these performances have been released as a bootleg; they remain the only recordings of MacLise with the Velvet Underground.\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground and Nico (1967)\\n\\nAt Warhol\\'s insistence, Nico sang with the Velvet Underground on four songs off their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The album was recorded in one or two days — there is some uncertainty between the band members\\' memories — at TT&G Studios during the November of 1966, and released by MGM Records in March of 1967.\\n\\nThe album cover was famous for its simple, suggestive Warhol design: a bright yellow banana with \"Peel Slowly and See\" printed near a perforated tab. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, phallic, peeled banana beneath. This would later be used as the cover to their boxed set, appropriately titled \"Peel Slowly and See,\" released in 1995.\\n\\nEleven songs showcased their stylistic range, veering from the pounding attacks of \"I\\'m Waiting For The Man\" and \"Run Run Run,\" the droning \"Venus In Furs\" and \"Heroin\" to the quiet \"Femme Fatale\" and the tender \"I\\'ll Be Your Mirror\".\\n\\nThe overall sound was propelled by Reed\\'s strong deadpan vocals, Cale\\'s droning or shrieking viola, Morrison\\'s often rhythm and blues or country-influenced guitar, and Tucker\\'s hypnotically simple but steady, propulsive beat.\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico peaked at number 171 on Billboard Magazine\\'s top 200 charts, but the promising debut was dampened somewhat by legal complications: The album\\'s back cover featured a still from a Warhol motion picture, Chelsea Girls. The film\\'s cinematographer, Eric Emerson, had been arrested for drug possession and, desperate for money, claimed the still had been included on the album without his permission. MGM Records pulled all copies of the album until the legal problems were settled (by which time the record had lost its modest commercial momentum), and the still was airbrushed out.\\n\\nWhite Light/White Heat (1968)\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground performed live often, and their performances became louder, harsher and often featured extended improvisations. Cale reports that at about this time, The Velvet Underground were one of the first groups to receive an endorsement from Vox. The company pioneered a number of special effects, which the Velvet Underground utilized on White Light/White Heat.\\n\\nReed fired Warhol as manager, and Nico was jettisoned, partly due to her unreliability. In September 1967, the VU recorded what would become their second album, White Light/White Heat, with Tom Wilson as producer. It was released January 1968.\\n\\nThe recording was raw and oversaturated, one of the harshest, loudest records yet released. Cale has stated that while the debut had some moments of fragility and beauty, White Light/White Heat was \"consciously anti-beauty\". Isler and Robbins suggest that the record \"is almost unbearably intense.\"\\n\\nThe title track and first song starts things off with Reed pounding on piano like a demented Jerry Lee Lewis. The eerie, hallucinatory \"Lady Godiva\\'s Operation\" remains Reed\\'s favorite track on the album.\\n\\nDespite the dominance of noisefests like \"Sister Ray\", and \"I Heard Her Call My Name\", there was room for the darkly comic \"The Gift\", a Reed-penned short story narrated in Cale\\'s deadpan Welsh accent. The meditative \"Here She Comes Now\" was later covered by Galaxie 500, Cabaret Voltaire, and Nirvana.\\n\\nIn 1968, a year after Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Are You Experienced, there was an experimental feeling throughout rock music, while it should be noted that the Velvets are arguably the foremost pioneers in this realm. There were a few other experimenters with noise, but few were tackling noise with as much apparent glee as the V.U. White Light/White Heat was hugely important, and \"Sister Ray\" is arguably one of the most significant rock songs of the late 1960s. The songs\\' simple 3-chord progression along with screeching organ and lead guitar, all distorted perhaps beyond the bounds of tastefulness, coupled with William Burroughs-influenced lyrics, was completely unique. \"Sister Ray\" is often seen as one of the earliest precursors of punk and Alternative rock, with its blistering instrumentation and alarming lyrics.\\n\\nThe second album\\'s cover was a subtle black-on-black picture of the tattooed arm of Billy Name, one of Warhol\\'s \"Factory\" members. White Light/White Heat entered the Billboard top 200 chart for 2 weeks, at number 199.\\n\\nTensions were growing: the group was tired of receiving little recognition for their hard work, and Reed and Cale were pulling the Velvet Underground in different directions. The differences showed in the last recording session the band had with John Cale in February 1968: two pop-like songs in Reed\\'s direction (\"Temptation Inside Your Heart\" and \"Stephanie Says\"), and a viola-driven drone in Cale\\'s direction (\"Hey Mr Rain\"). None of these songs were released until they were included on the VU and Another View compilation albums.\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground (1969)\\n\\nBefore work on their third album started, Reed fired Cale, and replaced him with Doug Yule. The Velvet Underground was recorded in late 1968, and released in March of 1969.\\n\\nIt\\'s often been reported that the early edition of the Velvet Underground was a struggle between Reed and Cale\\'s creative impulses: Reed\\'s rather conventional approach contrasted with Cale\\'s experimentalist tendencies. The Velvet Underground would seem to prove the truth of these claims, as the harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by folk music, prescient of the songwriting style that would form Reed\\'s solo career (another factor in the change of sound was the band\\'s amplifiers being stolen from an airport while they were on tour; they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with Sunn).\\n\\nMorrison\\'s ringing guitar parts and Yule\\'s melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are featured prominently on the album. Reed\\'s songs and singing are subdued and confessional, and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress. A rare Maureen Tucker vocal is featured on \"After Hours,\" a song that Reed said was so innocent and pure he couldn\\'t possibly sing it himself. The album\\'s influence can be heard in many later indie rock and lo-fi recordings.\\n\\nA year on the road and the \"lost\" fourth album (1969)\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road, feeling they were not accepted in their hometown of New York City and not making much headway commercially. During the same year, the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of material that was never officially released due to disputes with their record label. What many consider the prime of these sessions was released many years later as VU. This album has a transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the pop-rock anthems of their final record, Loaded.\\n\\nThe rest of the recordings, as well as some alternate takes, were bundled on Another View. After Reed\\'s departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records (\"Stephanie Says\", \"Ocean\", \"I Can\\'t Stand It\", \"Lisa Says\", \"She\\'s My Best Friend\"). Indeed, most of Reed\\'s early solo career\\'s more successful hits were reworked Velvet Underground tracks, released for the first time in their original version on VU, Another View, and later on Peel Slowly and See. The standout from VU is considered by many to be \"One of These Days,\" part torch song and part slide-guitar freakout.\\n\\nLoaded (1970)\\n\\nIn 1969, MGM Records president Mike Curb wanted to purge any drug- or hippie-related bands from MGM, and the V.U. were on his list, along with Frank Zappa\\'s Mothers of Invention. (Nonetheless, MGM insisted on keeping the tapes of their unissued recordings.)\\n\\nAtlantic Records signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album, Loaded, released on Atlantic\\'s subsidiary label Cotillion. The album\\'s title refers to Atlantic\\'s request that the band produce an album \"loaded with hits.\" Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the V.U. had performed, and several of Reed\\'s best-known songs, including \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\".\\n\\nThough Tucker had temporarily retired from the group due to her pregnancy, she received a performance credit on Loaded. Drums were actually played by several people, including Yule, engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanaro, and Doug Yule\\'s brother Billy, who was still in high school.\\n\\nDisillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making and pressured by manager Sesnick, Reed decided to quit the band and did so in August 1970. The band essentially broke while recording the album, and Reed walked off before it was finished. Doug Yule finished the album, singing parts to some of Reed\\'s vocal tracks. Lou Reed has often said he was completely surprised months later when he saw Loaded in stores. He also said, bitterly, \"I left them to their album full of hits that I made.\"\\n\\nReed was particularly bitter about the truncation of a verse from \"Sweet Jane\". \"New Age\" was changed as well: as originally recorded, its closing line (\"It\\'s the beginning of a new age\") was repeated many more times. A brief interlude in \"Rock and Roll\" was also removed. (Years later, the album would be reissued with the edits restored.) On the other hand, Yule has pointed that the album was to all intents and purposes finished when Reed left the band and that Reed had been aware of most if not all of the edits. The few weeks between Reed\\'s departure in late August and Loaded’s arrival in the shops in September of the same year also would have left little room for the whole process of editing, reviewing, mastering and pressing.\\n\\n1970 onwards\\n\\nAlthough Loaded\\'s spin-off single \"Who Loves the Sun\" did nothing, the album itself is something of a muted triumph. \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\" became U.S. radio favorites, and the band, featuring Walter Powers III on bass, and Doug Yule promoted to lead vocals and guitar, went on the road once more, playing the East Coast of the U.S. and Europe. By that time, however, Sterling Morrison had obtained a B.A. degree in English, and left the group for an academic career with the University of Texas at Austin. His replacement was singer/keyboard player Willie Alexander. The band played shows in England, Wales, and the Netherlands, some of which are collected on the 2001 box set Final V.U. (Longtime fans began mocking the new lineup as the \"Velveteen Underground\", perhaps unfairly.)\\n\\nIn 1972 Atlantic released Live at Max\\'s Kansas City, a live bootleg of one of the Velvet Underground\\'s final performances with Reed, recorded by fan Brigid Polk. By this time Doug Yule was once again touring the United Kingdom, this time backed with hired hands as Sesnick had sent home Tucker, Powers and Alexander, effectively ending their time with the band. Later that year, Sesnick managed to secure a recording contract with Polydor Records in England, and Yule recorded Squeeze under the Velvet Underground name with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice. Squeeze is a controversial item among Velvet fans, most of whom flatly decline to consider any post-Lou Reed material as worthwhile. Rarely heard before the advent of Internet audio file sharing, the album\\'s perceived Middle of the road content is sometimes dismissed out of hand by Velvets fans. Although the album technically is a Velvet Underground release, it is properly Doug Yule\\'s debut solo album and it might have fared far better if it had been labeled as such, given the actual quality of most of the tracks, some of which would not have been out of place on Loaded. (Interestingly, Yule was actually in the group longer than Cale.)\\n\\nPost-VU developments (1973-1990)\\n\\nReed and Cale, in the meantime, developed solo careers. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a tugboat captain for several years. Maureen Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in a number of touring bands, among others with Tucker\\'s band. In 1988, erstwhile singer Nico died of a brain hemorrhage while bicycling on the island of Ibiza.\\n\\nReunions (1990 and 1992-1994)\\n\\nIn 1990, Reed and Cale released Songs for Drella, dedicated to the recently deceased Andy Warhol. (\"Drella\" was a nickname Warhol had adopted, a combination of \"Dracula\" and \"Cinderella\".) Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the V.U. broke up, Songs for Drella was the first time the mercurial pair had worked together in decades, and rumors of a reunion began to circulate, fueled by the one-off appearance by Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker to play \"Heroin\" as the encore to a brief Songs for Drella set in Jouy-en-Josas, France.\\n\\nThe same lineup briefly reunited from 1992–1994, resulting in a European tour — both headlining and opening a few concerts for U2 — and a live album, Live MCMXCIII. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had performed with the group.\\n\\nBefore the band could tour the U.S. or record — an MTV Unplugged album was proposed — Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more. The definitive end to the band\\'s checkered career came when Sterling Morrison died of cancer in 1995. Reed\\'s death in 2013 put a permanent end to any hopes of further Velvet Underground reunions; tributes poured out from all corners of the internet upon the news.\\n\\nIn recent years, the band\\'s first four albums have been reissued with expanded box sets featuring two to five discs\\' worth of bonus content. An archival series of live recordings has also been issued as The Complete Matrix Tapes, which has been praised both for its audio fidelity and for the quality of the performances (many of the recordings here were initially the source of the band\\'s acclaimed 1969 Live album, but the sound quality has been further cleaned up).\\n\\nSelected discography:\\n\\n1967 - The Velvet Underground & Nico\\n1968 - White Light/White Heat\\n1969 - The Velvet Underground\\n1970 - Loaded\\n1972 - Live at Max\\'s Kansas City\\n1973 - Squeeze\\n1974 - 1969: The Velvet Underground Live\\n1985 - VU (rarities compilation)\\n1986 - Another View (rarities compilation)\\n1993 - Live MCMXCIII\\n1995 - Peel Slowly and See (box set)\\n2001 - Final V.U. 1971-1973 (live)\\n2001 - The Quine Tapes (live)\\n2015 - The Complete Matrix Tapes (live) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It originally comprised singer and guitarist Lou Reed, Welsh multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus MacLise. In 1965 MacLise was replaced by Moe Tucker, who played on most of the band\\'s recordings. Though their integration of rock and the avant-garde resulted in little commercial success, they became one of the most influential bands in rock, underground, experimental, and alternative music. \\n\\n“The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band!” — Brian Eno.\\n\\nKnown by many as \"The Velvets\", the band was formed in New York City and first active from 1965 to 1973. Their best-known lineup consisted of vocalist/guitarist Lou Reed, bassist/violist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker. The band also collaborated with Nico for their debut album in 1967, under the supervision of producer and pop artist Andy Warhol. \\n\\nSome see The Velvet Underground as being a bridge between the pacifist themes of the late 60s and the sheer chaos and indifference of the mid-70s punk movement. \\n\\nThe Velvet Underground was one of the first rock music groups to experiment heavily with the form by incorporating avant-garde influences. The group\\'s often raw, sometimes difficult sound would influence many later punk, noise rock, and alternative music performers, and singer Lou Reed\\'s lyrics brought new levels of social realism and sleaze to rock. Critics Scott Isler and Ira Robbins argue that \"The Velvet Underground marked a turning point in rock history. After the release of The Velvet Underground & Nico knowing the power of which it was capable, the music could never be as innocent, as unselfconscious as before.\" \\n\\nPre-history (1964-1965) \\n\\nThe foundations for what would become The Velvet Underground were laid in late 1964. Lou Reed had performed with a few short-lived garage bands and had worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, a job Reed described as \"a poor man\\'s Carole King\". Reed met John Cale, a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music. Cale had worked with John Cage and La Monte Young, but was also interested in rock music. (Young\\'s use of extended drones would be a profound influence on the early Velvet\\'s sound). The pair rehearsed and performed together, and their partnership and shared interests steered the early direction of what would become the Velvet Underground.\\n\\nReed\\'s first group with Cale was the short-lived The Primitives, assembled to support a Reed-penned single, \"The Ostrich\". Reed and Cale recruited Sterling Morrison – a college classmate of Reed\\'s who had already played with him a few times – to play guitar, and Angus MacLise to play percussion. This quartet was first called The Warlocks, then The Falling Spikes.\\n\\nWhile moving into his New York City apartment Reed found the book The Velvet Underground by Michael Leigh, a book about sadomasochism, left by previous tenant Tony Conrad. Reed and Morrison have reported the group liked the name, considering it evocative of \"underground cinema,\" and fitting, due to Reed\\'s already having written \"Venus In Furs\", inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch\\'s book of the same name, also dealing with sadomasochism. The band immediately and unanimously adopted the book\\'s title for its new name.\\n\\nEarly stages (1965-1966)\\n\\nThe newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of beatnik poetry, with MacLise playing gentle \"pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone\".\\n\\nIn July of 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a demo tape. When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale gave a copy of the tape to Marianne Faithfull, hoping she\\'d pass it on to Mick Jagger. Nothing ever came of the demo. The demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See.\\n\\nWhen the group accepted an offer of $75 for their first paying performance at Summit High School, in Summit, NJ, MacLise left the group, protesting what he considered a sell out. \"Angus was in it for art\", Morrison reported.\\n\\nMacLise was replaced by Maureen Tucker, Jim Tucker\\'s younger sister. Tucker\\'s abbreviated drum kit was rather unusual: She generally played on tom toms and an upturned bass drum, using mallets rather than drumsticks, and she rarely used cymbals. The band having asked her to \\'do something unusual\\', she turned her bass drum on its side, and played standing up. When her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans, brought in from outside. Her driving rhythms were at once simple yet exotic, influenced by Babatunde Olatunji and Bo Diddley records, and became an essential part of the group\\'s music. The group earned a regular paying gig at a club, and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble.\\n\\nWhile the American west coast was undergoing the Summer of Love, psychedelia and flower power, the typically east coast Velvets concerned themselves with darker subject matter: transvestites, heroin addiction, and sadomasochism. Also setting them apart from their contemporaries was their use of feedback and amplifier noise in a musical context, exemplified by the seventeen minute track \"Sister Ray\" from their White Light/White Heat album.\\n\\nAndy Warhol and the Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable (1966-1967)\\n\\nAndy Warhol became the band\\'s manager in 1965, and suggested they feature the German-born singer Nico on several songs. Warhol\\'s reputation certainly helped the band gain a higher profile. Though Reed eventually fired Warhol, he praised the integrity of his early efforts with the group. Warhol helped the band land a coveted recording contract with MGM\\'s Verve Records, with himself as nominal \\'producer\\', and gave the Velvets unprecedented free reign over the sound they created.\\n\\nDuring their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable., for which they provided the musical part. This show played a couple of months in New York City, then took to the road all over the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967.\\n\\nIn 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few E.P.I. shows when Reed was suffering from hepatitis and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ and Tucker switched to bass guitar. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed \"The Booker T\", after the leader of the musical group Booker T & the MG\\'s; the jam later became the music for \"The Gift\" on White Light/White Heat. Some of these performances have been released as a bootleg; they remain the only recordings of MacLise with the Velvet Underground.\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground and Nico (1967)\\n\\nAt Warhol\\'s insistence, Nico sang with the Velvet Underground on four songs off their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The album was recorded in one or two days — there is some uncertainty between the band members\\' memories — at TT&G Studios during the November of 1966, and released by MGM Records in March of 1967.\\n\\nThe album cover was famous for its simple, suggestive Warhol design: a bright yellow banana with \"Peel Slowly and See\" printed near a perforated tab. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, phallic, peeled banana beneath. This would later be used as the cover to their boxed set, appropriately titled \"Peel Slowly and See,\" released in 1995.\\n\\nEleven songs showcased their stylistic range, veering from the pounding attacks of \"I\\'m Waiting For The Man\" and \"Run Run Run,\" the droning \"Venus In Furs\" and \"Heroin\" to the quiet \"Femme Fatale\" and the tender \"I\\'ll Be Your Mirror\".\\n\\nThe overall sound was propelled by Reed\\'s strong deadpan vocals, Cale\\'s droning or shrieking viola, Morrison\\'s often rhythm and blues or country-influenced guitar, and Tucker\\'s hypnotically simple but steady, propulsive beat.\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico peaked at number 171 on Billboard Magazine\\'s top 200 charts, but the promising debut was dampened somewhat by legal complications: The album\\'s back cover featured a still from a Warhol motion picture, Chelsea Girls. The film\\'s cinematographer, Eric Emerson, had been arrested for drug possession and, desperate for money, claimed the still had been included on the album without his permission. MGM Records pulled all copies of the album until the legal problems were settled (by which time the record had lost its modest commercial momentum), and the still was airbrushed out.\\n\\nWhite Light/White Heat (1968)\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground performed live often, and their performances became louder, harsher and often featured extended improvisations. Cale reports that at about this time, The Velvet Underground were one of the first groups to receive an endorsement from Vox. The company pioneered a number of special effects, which the Velvet Underground utilized on White Light/White Heat.\\n\\nReed fired Warhol as manager, and Nico was jettisoned, partly due to her unreliability. In September 1967, the VU recorded what would become their second album, White Light/White Heat, with Tom Wilson as producer. It was released January 1968.\\n\\nThe recording was raw and oversaturated, one of the harshest, loudest records yet released. Cale has stated that while the debut had some moments of fragility and beauty, White Light/White Heat was \"consciously anti-beauty\". Isler and Robbins suggest that the record \"is almost unbearably intense.\"\\n\\nThe title track and first song starts things off with Reed pounding on piano like a demented Jerry Lee Lewis. The eerie, hallucinatory \"Lady Godiva\\'s Operation\" remains Reed\\'s favorite track on the album.\\n\\nDespite the dominance of noisefests like \"Sister Ray\", and \"I Heard Her Call My Name\", there was room for the darkly comic \"The Gift\", a Reed-penned short story narrated in Cale\\'s deadpan Welsh accent. The meditative \"Here She Comes Now\" was later covered by Galaxie 500, Cabaret Voltaire, and Nirvana.\\n\\nIn 1968, a year after Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Are You Experienced, there was an experimental feeling throughout rock music, while it should be noted that the Velvets are arguably the foremost pioneers in this realm. There were a few other experimenters with noise, but few were tackling noise with as much apparent glee as the V.U. White Light/White Heat was hugely important, and \"Sister Ray\" is arguably one of the most significant rock songs of the late 1960s. The songs\\' simple 3-chord progression along with screeching organ and lead guitar, all distorted perhaps beyond the bounds of tastefulness, coupled with William Burroughs-influenced lyrics, was completely unique. \"Sister Ray\" is often seen as one of the earliest precursors of punk and Alternative rock, with its blistering instrumentation and alarming lyrics.\\n\\nThe second album\\'s cover was a subtle black-on-black picture of the tattooed arm of Billy Name, one of Warhol\\'s \"Factory\" members. White Light/White Heat entered the Billboard top 200 chart for 2 weeks, at number 199.\\n\\nTensions were growing: the group was tired of receiving little recognition for their hard work, and Reed and Cale were pulling the Velvet Underground in different directions. The differences showed in the last recording session the band had with John Cale in February 1968: two pop-like songs in Reed\\'s direction (\"Temptation Inside Your Heart\" and \"Stephanie Says\"), and a viola-driven drone in Cale\\'s direction (\"Hey Mr Rain\"). None of these songs were released until they were included on the VU and Another View compilation albums.\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground (1969)\\n\\nBefore work on their third album started, Reed fired Cale, and replaced him with Doug Yule. The Velvet Underground was recorded in late 1968, and released in March of 1969.\\n\\nIt\\'s often been reported that the early edition of the Velvet Underground was a struggle between Reed and Cale\\'s creative impulses: Reed\\'s rather conventional approach contrasted with Cale\\'s experimentalist tendencies. The Velvet Underground would seem to prove the truth of these claims, as the harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by folk music, prescient of the songwriting style that would form Reed\\'s solo career (another factor in the change of sound was the band\\'s amplifiers being stolen from an airport while they were on tour; they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with Sunn).\\n\\nMorrison\\'s ringing guitar parts and Yule\\'s melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are featured prominently on the album. Reed\\'s songs and singing are subdued and confessional, and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress. A rare Maureen Tucker vocal is featured on \"After Hours,\" a song that Reed said was so innocent and pure he couldn\\'t possibly sing it himself. The album\\'s influence can be heard in many later indie rock and lo-fi recordings.\\n\\nA year on the road and the \"lost\" fourth album (1969)\\n\\nThe Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road, feeling they were not accepted in their hometown of New York City and not making much headway commercially. During the same year, the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of material that was never officially released due to disputes with their record label. What many consider the prime of these sessions was released many years later as VU. This album has a transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the pop-rock anthems of their final record, Loaded.\\n\\nThe rest of the recordings, as well as some alternate takes, were bundled on Another View. After Reed\\'s departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records (\"Stephanie Says\", \"Ocean\", \"I Can\\'t Stand It\", \"Lisa Says\", \"She\\'s My Best Friend\"). Indeed, most of Reed\\'s early solo career\\'s more successful hits were reworked Velvet Underground tracks, released for the first time in their original version on VU, Another View, and later on Peel Slowly and See. The standout from VU is considered by many to be \"One of These Days,\" part torch song and part slide-guitar freakout.\\n\\nLoaded (1970)\\n\\nIn 1969, MGM Records president Mike Curb wanted to purge any drug- or hippie-related bands from MGM, and the V.U. were on his list, along with Frank Zappa\\'s Mothers of Invention. (Nonetheless, MGM insisted on keeping the tapes of their unissued recordings.)\\n\\nAtlantic Records signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album, Loaded, released on Atlantic\\'s subsidiary label Cotillion. The album\\'s title refers to Atlantic\\'s request that the band produce an album \"loaded with hits.\" Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the V.U. had performed, and several of Reed\\'s best-known songs, including \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\".\\n\\nThough Tucker had temporarily retired from the group due to her pregnancy, she received a performance credit on Loaded. Drums were actually played by several people, including Yule, engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanaro, and Doug Yule\\'s brother Billy, who was still in high school.\\n\\nDisillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making and pressured by manager Sesnick, Reed decided to quit the band and did so in August 1970. The band essentially broke while recording the album, and Reed walked off before it was finished. Doug Yule finished the album, singing parts to some of Reed\\'s vocal tracks. Lou Reed has often said he was completely surprised months later when he saw Loaded in stores. He also said, bitterly, \"I left them to their album full of hits that I made.\"\\n\\nReed was particularly bitter about the truncation of a verse from \"Sweet Jane\". \"New Age\" was changed as well: as originally recorded, its closing line (\"It\\'s the beginning of a new age\") was repeated many more times. A brief interlude in \"Rock and Roll\" was also removed. (Years later, the album would be reissued with the edits restored.) On the other hand, Yule has pointed that the album was to all intents and purposes finished when Reed left the band and that Reed had been aware of most if not all of the edits. The few weeks between Reed\\'s departure in late August and Loaded’s arrival in the shops in September of the same year also would have left little room for the whole process of editing, reviewing, mastering and pressing.\\n\\n1970 onwards\\n\\nAlthough Loaded\\'s spin-off single \"Who Loves the Sun\" did nothing, the album itself is something of a muted triumph. \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\" became U.S. radio favorites, and the band, featuring Walter Powers III on bass, and Doug Yule promoted to lead vocals and guitar, went on the road once more, playing the East Coast of the U.S. and Europe. By that time, however, Sterling Morrison had obtained a B.A. degree in English, and left the group for an academic career with the University of Texas at Austin. His replacement was singer/keyboard player Willie Alexander. The band played shows in England, Wales, and the Netherlands, some of which are collected on the 2001 box set Final V.U. (Longtime fans began mocking the new lineup as the \"Velveteen Underground\", perhaps unfairly.)\\n\\nIn 1972 Atlantic released Live at Max\\'s Kansas City, a live bootleg of one of the Velvet Underground\\'s final performances with Reed, recorded by fan Brigid Polk. By this time Doug Yule was once again touring the United Kingdom, this time backed with hired hands as Sesnick had sent home Tucker, Powers and Alexander, effectively ending their time with the band. Later that year, Sesnick managed to secure a recording contract with Polydor Records in England, and Yule recorded Squeeze under the Velvet Underground name with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice. Squeeze is a controversial item among Velvet fans, most of whom flatly decline to consider any post-Lou Reed material as worthwhile. Rarely heard before the advent of Internet audio file sharing, the album\\'s perceived Middle of the road content is sometimes dismissed out of hand by Velvets fans. Although the album technically is a Velvet Underground release, it is properly Doug Yule\\'s debut solo album and it might have fared far better if it had been labeled as such, given the actual quality of most of the tracks, some of which would not have been out of place on Loaded. (Interestingly, Yule was actually in the group longer than Cale.)\\n\\nPost-VU developments (1973-1990)\\n\\nReed and Cale, in the meantime, developed solo careers. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a tugboat captain for several years. Maureen Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in a number of touring bands, among others with Tucker\\'s band. In 1988, erstwhile singer Nico died of a brain hemorrhage while bicycling on the island of Ibiza.\\n\\nReunions (1990 and 1992-1994)\\n\\nIn 1990, Reed and Cale released Songs for Drella, dedicated to the recently deceased Andy Warhol. (\"Drella\" was a nickname Warhol had adopted, a combination of \"Dracula\" and \"Cinderella\".) Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the V.U. broke up, Songs for Drella was the first time the mercurial pair had worked together in decades, and rumors of a reunion began to circulate, fueled by the one-off appearance by Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker to play \"Heroin\" as the encore to a brief Songs for Drella set in Jouy-en-Josas, France.\\n\\nThe same lineup briefly reunited from 1992–1994, resulting in a European tour — both headlining and opening a few concerts for U2 — and a live album, Live MCMXCIII. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had performed with the group.\\n\\nBefore the band could tour the U.S. or record — an MTV Unplugged album was proposed — Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more. The definitive end to the band\\'s checkered career came when Sterling Morrison died of cancer in 1995. Reed\\'s death in 2013 put a permanent end to any hopes of further Velvet Underground reunions; tributes poured out from all corners of the internet upon the news.\\n\\nIn recent years, the band\\'s first four albums have been reissued with expanded box sets featuring two to five discs\\' worth of bonus content. An archival series of live recordings has also been issued as The Complete Matrix Tapes, which has been praised both for its audio fidelity and for the quality of the performances (many of the recordings here were initially the source of the band\\'s acclaimed 1969 Live album, but the sound quality has been further cleaned up).\\n\\nSelected discography:\\n\\n1967 - The Velvet Underground & Nico\\n1968 - White Light/White Heat\\n1969 - The Velvet Underground\\n1970 - Loaded\\n1972 - Live at Max\\'s Kansas City\\n1973 - Squeeze\\n1974 - 1969: The Velvet Underground Live\\n1985 - VU (rarities compilation)\\n1986 - Another View (rarities compilation)\\n1993 - Live MCMXCIII\\n1995 - Peel Slowly and See (box set)\\n2001 - Final V.U. 1971-1973 (live)\\n2001 - The Quine Tapes (live)\\n2015 - The Complete Matrix Tapes (live) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_nl": "The Velvet Underground was een experimentele rockgroep uit New York die actief was van 1964 tot 1973. Hoewel de groep destijds geen noemenswaardig commercieel succes boekte, geldt The Velvet Underground tegenwoordig als een van de meest vooruitstrevende en invloedrijkste rockgroepen aller tijden.\n\nDe klassieke bezetting van de groep bestond uit zanger en gitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, gitarist Sterling Morrison en drummer Maureen Tucker. In 1967 verscheen hun debuutalbum The Velvet Underground & Nico, onder toeziend oog van kunstenaar Andy Warhol en met een gastrol voor zangeres Nico. Dit album wordt gezien als een mijlpaal in de rockgeschiedenis vanwege diens innovatieve combinatie van rockmuziek met aleatorische muziek, microtonaliteit en minimale muziek, begeleid door taboedoorbrekende poëzie over de duistere kant van het leven, met onderwerpen als drugsgebruik, sadomasochisme en decadentisme.\n\nOp hun tweede album, White light/White heat uit 1968, klonk de groep nog rauwer en compromislozer dan voorheen. Vanwege meningsverschillen met Reed verliet Cale de groep in 1968 en werd hij vervangen door Doug Yule.

      "biography_pt": "The Velvet Underground foi uma influente banda de rock norte-americana, formada em 1964 por Lou Reed (voz e guitarra), Sterling Morrison (guitarra), John Cale (baixo), Doug Yule (que substituiu Cale em 1968), Nico (voz), Angus MacAlise (bateria) e Maureen Tucker (que substituiu Angus MacAlise).\n\nO Velvet Underground foi uma banda de vanguarda da década de 60, caracterizada por um estilo experimental, pouco comercial para a época. A banda alcançou, por este motivo, durante seus poucos anos de existência, apenas uma pequena fração do reconhecimento público quanto ao grande mérito criativo e inventivo que hoje a faz ser citada unanimemente pela crítica especializada como um dos poucos grupos realmente essenciais da história do rock'n'roll. Parte deste pouco reconhecimento experimentado, no entanto, deve-se ao contato dos membros do grupo com outros grandes nomes da vanguarda artística novaiorquina, e, em especial, com o artista plástico norte-americano Andy Warhol, que se dizia cansado da pintura e promovia incursões por outros campos artísticos como a música e o cinema em sua The Factory.\n\nWarhol agregou a seu redor um grande grupo de artistas independentes daquele período através desta postura, incluindo Lou Reed, Nico, e todo o grupo; mas sua influência sobre a banda por vezes é mal interpretada: há uma tendência equivocada a considerá-lo uma espécie de \"mentor intelectual\" do grupo quando, na verdade, grande parte das canções deste já haviam sido escritas (e por consequência, sua proposta artística já estava definida) antes do contato com ele. Andy Warhol, apesar de financiador, nunca exerceu grande influência sobre os temas a serem abordados nas músicas ou sobre a estética melódica em si, de forma que uma relação entre a música de Lou Reed e a Pop Art de Warhol seria, na melhor das hipóteses, extremamente sutil; um reflexo da convivência entre os artistas, apenas. No entanto ele teve forte influência em um importante episódio da história da banda: inclusão de Nico como vocalista em seu álbum de estréria, que ocorreu por imposição de Andy Warhol, mesmo sob protestos de membros do grupo. Como uma forma de objeção o nome do grupo no primeiro álbum foi \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\", excluindo-a, de certa forma, da banda.\n\nLogo após o lançamento do álbum \"White Light/White Heat\" a banda se desligaria tanto de Nico quanto de Andy, no entanto.\n\nO primeiro disco, The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967), notabilizou-se por uma banana na capa (feita por Andy Warhol), e também pelas composições completamente vanguardistas para os padrões da época, tratando de temas como drogas (\"I'm Waiting For The Man\" e \"Heroin\"), sadomasoquismo (\"Venus In Furs\"), prostitutas (\"There She Goes Again\"), e até ocultismo (\"The Black Angel's Death Song\"). As vendas do LP, no entanto, foram pífias, mas existe uma lenda na qual quem o comprou montou uma banda após ouvi-lo - por exemplo, artistas como Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Sonic Youth, Jesus and Mary Chain, Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead e The Strokes foram influenciados pelo Velvet Underground.\n\nGravado em poucos dias, \"White Light/White Heat\" foi lançado no início de 1968. Após esse álbum (que é mais barulhento e tão ousado quanto o seu antecessor, e conta com clássicos como a faixa-título, \"Here She Comes Now\" e \"Sister Ray\", John Cale, responsável pelos experimentalismos musicais, saiu da banda, que passou a ter Lou Reed, de maior apelo artístico e poético, como único líder.\n\nNo ano seguinte, veio o 3º álbum, chamado simplesmente de \"The Velvet Underground\". Ele expõe um som mais acústico e introspectivo do que os anteriores, e é recheado de ótimas composições como \"Candy Says\", \"What Goes On\", \"Beginning To See The Light\".\n\nO derradeiro trabalho com Lou Reed ainda na banda foi \"Loaded\", que conta com três das músicas mais famosas do VU: \"Who Loves The Sun\", \"Sweet Jane\" e \"Rock and Roll\". Após a saída do vocalista em 71, a banda ainda continuou na ativa pelos dois anos seguintes e até lançou um LP (\"Squeeze\"), mas o mesmo sequer é considerado parte de sua discografia oficial.\n\nO ambiente natural de criação e trabalho do VU era a chamada \"The Factory\", prédio alugado por Warhol e decorado por Billy Name, para reunir seus companheiros exóticos.\n\nO interesse pela banda voltou a crescer no fim dos anos 1980, quando John Cale e Lou Reed voltaram a trabalhar juntos e gravaram, em 1989, um disco em homenagem a Andy Warhol chamado \"Songs For Drella\" (que era um apelido do artista, uma corruptela \"Drácula\" com \"Cinderella\") Durante um dos shows para mostrar o disco em Paris, em julho de 1990, a dupla convidou Sterling Morrison e Maureen Tucker para tocarem, juntos, a clássica \"Heroin\". Em 1993 o Velvet se reuniu para alguns shows, que culminaram num álbum duplo, \"Live MCMXCIII\", com as principais músicas da carreira da banda.\n\nO VU sempre foi conhecido pelo som alternativo, desvinculado de interesses comerciais e que focalizava quase sempre temas relacionados ao submundo (narcóticos, prostituição, criminalidade, etc). Demoraram anos para serem reconhecidos pelo grande trabalho, o que só prova o quanto a sonoridade deles estava bem à frente de sua época.",

      "bio_content": "The Velvet Underground were an American rock band formed in New York City in 1964. It originally comprised singer and guitarist Lou Reed, Welsh multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus MacLise. In 1965 MacLise was replaced by Moe Tucker, who played on most of the band's recordings. Though their integration of rock and the avant-garde resulted in little commercial success, they became one of the most influential bands in rock, underground, experimental, and alternative music. \n\n“The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band!” — Brian Eno.\n\nKnown by many as \"The Velvets\", the band was formed in New York City and first active from 1965 to 1973. Their best-known lineup consisted of vocalist/guitarist Lou Reed, bassist/violist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker. The band also collaborated with Nico for their debut album in 1967, under the supervision of producer and pop artist Andy Warhol. \n\nSome see The Velvet Underground as being a bridge between the pacifist themes of the late 60s and the sheer chaos and indifference of the mid-70s punk movement. \n\nThe Velvet Underground was one of the first rock music groups to experiment heavily with the form by incorporating avant-garde influences. The group's often raw, sometimes difficult sound would influence many later punk, noise rock, and alternative music performers, and singer Lou Reed's lyrics brought new levels of social realism and sleaze to rock. Critics Scott Isler and Ira Robbins argue that \"The Velvet Underground marked a turning point in rock history. After the release of The Velvet Underground & Nico knowing the power of which it was capable, the music could never be as innocent, as unselfconscious as before.\" \n\nPre-history (1964-1965) \n\nThe foundations for what would become The Velvet Underground were laid in late 1964. Lou Reed had performed with a few short-lived garage bands and had worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, a job Reed described as \"a poor man's Carole King\". Reed met John Cale, a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music. Cale had worked with John Cage and La Monte Young, but was also interested in rock music. (Young's use of extended drones would be a profound influence on the early Velvet's sound). The pair rehearsed and performed together, and their partnership and shared interests steered the early direction of what would become the Velvet Underground.\n\nReed's first group with Cale was the short-lived The Primitives, assembled to support a Reed-penned single, \"The Ostrich\". Reed and Cale recruited Sterling Morrison – a college classmate of Reed's who had already played with him a few times – to play guitar, and Angus MacLise to play percussion. This quartet was first called The Warlocks, then The Falling Spikes.\n\nWhile moving into his New York City apartment Reed found the book The Velvet Underground by Michael Leigh, a book about sadomasochism, left by previous tenant Tony Conrad. Reed and Morrison have reported the group liked the name, considering it evocative of \"underground cinema,\" and fitting, due to Reed's already having written \"Venus In Furs\", inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's book of the same name, also dealing with sadomasochism. The band immediately and unanimously adopted the book's title for its new name.\n\nEarly stages (1965-1966)\n\nThe newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of beatnik poetry, with MacLise playing gentle \"pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone\".\n\nIn July of 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a demo tape. When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale gave a copy of the tape to Marianne Faithfull, hoping she'd pass it on to Mick Jagger. Nothing ever came of the demo. The demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See.\n\nWhen the group accepted an offer of $75 for their first paying performance at Summit High School, in Summit, NJ, MacLise left the group, protesting what he considered a sell out. \"Angus was in it for art\", Morrison reported.\n\nMacLise was replaced by Maureen Tucker, Jim Tucker's younger sister. Tucker's abbreviated drum kit was rather unusual: She generally played on tom toms and an upturned bass drum, using mallets rather than drumsticks, and she rarely used cymbals. The band having asked her to 'do something unusual', she turned her bass drum on its side, and played standing up. When her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans, brought in from outside. Her driving rhythms were at once simple yet exotic, influenced by Babatunde Olatunji and Bo Diddley records, and became an essential part of the group's music. The group earned a regular paying gig at a club, and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble.\n\nWhile the American west coast was undergoing the Summer of Love, psychedelia and flower power, the typically east coast Velvets concerned themselves with darker subject matter: transvestites, heroin addiction, and sadomasochism. Also setting them apart from their contemporaries was their use of feedback and amplifier noise in a musical context, exemplified by the seventeen minute track \"Sister Ray\" from their White Light/White Heat album.\n\nAndy Warhol and the Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable (1966-1967)\n\nAndy Warhol became the band's manager in 1965, and suggested they feature the German-born singer Nico on several songs. Warhol's reputation certainly helped the band gain a higher profile. Though Reed eventually fired Warhol, he praised the integrity of his early efforts with the group. Warhol helped the band land a coveted recording contract with MGM's Verve Records, with himself as nominal 'producer', and gave the Velvets unprecedented free reign over the sound they created.\n\nDuring their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable., for which they provided the musical part. This show played a couple of months in New York City, then took to the road all over the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967.\n\nIn 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few E.P.I. shows when Reed was suffering from hepatitis and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ and Tucker switched to bass guitar. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed \"The Booker T\", after the leader of the musical group Booker T & the MG's; the jam later became the music for \"The Gift\" on White Light/White Heat. Some of these performances have been released as a bootleg; they remain the only recordings of MacLise with the Velvet Underground.\n\nThe Velvet Underground and Nico (1967)\n\nAt Warhol's insistence, Nico sang with the Velvet Underground on four songs off their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The album was recorded in one or two days — there is some uncertainty between the band members' memories — at TT&G Studios during the November of 1966, and released by MGM Records in March of 1967.\n\nThe album cover was famous for its simple, suggestive Warhol design: a bright yellow banana with \"Peel Slowly and See\" printed near a perforated tab. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, phallic, peeled banana beneath. This would later be used as the cover to their boxed set, appropriately titled \"Peel Slowly and See,\" released in 1995.\n\nEleven songs showcased their stylistic range, veering from the pounding attacks of \"I'm Waiting For The Man\" and \"Run Run Run,\" the droning \"Venus In Furs\" and \"Heroin\" to the quiet \"Femme Fatale\" and the tender \"I'll Be Your Mirror\".\n\nThe overall sound was propelled by Reed's strong deadpan vocals, Cale's droning or shrieking viola, Morrison's often rhythm and blues or country-influenced guitar, and Tucker's hypnotically simple but steady, propulsive beat.\n\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico peaked at number 171 on Billboard Magazine's top 200 charts, but the promising debut was dampened somewhat by legal complications: The album's back cover featured a still from a Warhol motion picture, Chelsea Girls. The film's cinematographer, Eric Emerson, had been arrested for drug possession and, desperate for money, claimed the still had been included on the album without his permission. MGM Records pulled all copies of the album until the legal problems were settled (by which time the record had lost its modest commercial momentum), and the still was airbrushed out.\n\nWhite Light/White Heat (1968)\n\nThe Velvet Underground performed live often, and their performances became louder, harsher and often featured extended improvisations. Cale reports that at about this time, The Velvet Underground were one of the first groups to receive an endorsement from Vox. The company pioneered a number of special effects, which the Velvet Underground utilized on White Light/White Heat.\n\nReed fired Warhol as manager, and Nico was jettisoned, partly due to her unreliability. In September 1967, the VU recorded what would become their second album, White Light/White Heat, with Tom Wilson as producer. It was released January 1968.\n\nThe recording was raw and oversaturated, one of the harshest, loudest records yet released. Cale has stated that while the debut had some moments of fragility and beauty, White Light/White Heat was \"consciously anti-beauty\". Isler and Robbins suggest that the record \"is almost unbearably intense.\"\n\nThe title track and first song starts things off with Reed pounding on piano like a demented Jerry Lee Lewis. The eerie, hallucinatory \"Lady Godiva's Operation\" remains Reed's favorite track on the album.\n\nDespite the dominance of noisefests like \"Sister Ray\", and \"I Heard Her Call My Name\", there was room for the darkly comic \"The Gift\", a Reed-penned short story narrated in Cale's deadpan Welsh accent. The meditative \"Here She Comes Now\" was later covered by Galaxie 500, Cabaret Voltaire, and Nirvana.\n\nIn 1968, a year after Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Are You Experienced, there was an experimental feeling throughout rock music, while it should be noted that the Velvets are arguably the foremost pioneers in this realm. There were a few other experimenters with noise, but few were tackling noise with as much apparent glee as the V.U. White Light/White Heat was hugely important, and \"Sister Ray\" is arguably one of the most significant rock songs of the late 1960s. The songs' simple 3-chord progression along with screeching organ and lead guitar, all distorted perhaps beyond the bounds of tastefulness, coupled with William Burroughs-influenced lyrics, was completely unique. \"Sister Ray\" is often seen as one of the earliest precursors of punk and Alternative rock, with its blistering instrumentation and alarming lyrics.\n\nThe second album's cover was a subtle black-on-black picture of the tattooed arm of Billy Name, one of Warhol's \"Factory\" members. White Light/White Heat entered the Billboard top 200 chart for 2 weeks, at number 199.\n\nTensions were growing: the group was tired of receiving little recognition for their hard work, and Reed and Cale were pulling the Velvet Underground in different directions. The differences showed in the last recording session the band had with John Cale in February 1968: two pop-like songs in Reed's direction (\"Temptation Inside Your Heart\" and \"Stephanie Says\"), and a viola-driven drone in Cale's direction (\"Hey Mr Rain\"). None of these songs were released until they were included on the VU and Another View compilation albums.\n\nThe Velvet Underground (1969)\n\nBefore work on their third album started, Reed fired Cale, and replaced him with Doug Yule. The Velvet Underground was recorded in late 1968, and released in March of 1969.\n\nIt's often been reported that the early edition of the Velvet Underground was a struggle between Reed and Cale's creative impulses: Reed's rather conventional approach contrasted with Cale's experimentalist tendencies. The Velvet Underground would seem to prove the truth of these claims, as the harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by folk music, prescient of the songwriting style that would form Reed's solo career (another factor in the change of sound was the band's amplifiers being stolen from an airport while they were on tour; they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with Sunn).\n\nMorrison's ringing guitar parts and Yule's melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are featured prominently on the album. Reed's songs and singing are subdued and confessional, and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress. A rare Maureen Tucker vocal is featured on \"After Hours,\" a song that Reed said was so innocent and pure he couldn't possibly sing it himself. The album's influence can be heard in many later indie rock and lo-fi recordings.\n\nA year on the road and the \"lost\" fourth album (1969)\n\nThe Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road, feeling they were not accepted in their hometown of New York City and not making much headway commercially. During the same year, the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of material that was never officially released due to disputes with their record label. What many consider the prime of these sessions was released many years later as VU. This album has a transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the pop-rock anthems of their final record, Loaded.\n\nThe rest of the recordings, as well as some alternate takes, were bundled on Another View. After Reed's departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records (\"Stephanie Says\", \"Ocean\", \"I Can't Stand It\", \"Lisa Says\", \"She's My Best Friend\"). Indeed, most of Reed's early solo career's more successful hits were reworked Velvet Underground tracks, released for the first time in their original version on VU, Another View, and later on Peel Slowly and See. The standout from VU is considered by many to be \"One of These Days,\" part torch song and part slide-guitar freakout.\n\nLoaded (1970)\n\nIn 1969, MGM Records president Mike Curb wanted to purge any drug- or hippie-related bands from MGM, and the V.U. were on his list, along with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. (Nonetheless, MGM insisted on keeping the tapes of their unissued recordings.)\n\nAtlantic Records signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album, Loaded, released on Atlantic's subsidiary label Cotillion. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album \"loaded with hits.\" Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the V.U. had performed, and several of Reed's best-known songs, including \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\".\n\nThough Tucker had temporarily retired from the group due to her pregnancy, she received a performance credit on Loaded. Drums were actually played by several people, including Yule, engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanaro, and Doug Yule's brother Billy, who was still in high school.\n\nDisillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making and pressured by manager Sesnick, Reed decided to quit the band and did so in August 1970. The band essentially broke while recording the album, and Reed walked off before it was finished. Doug Yule finished the album, singing parts to some of Reed's vocal tracks. Lou Reed has often said he was completely surprised months later when he saw Loaded in stores. He also said, bitterly, \"I left them to their album full of hits that I made.\"\n\nReed was particularly bitter about the truncation of a verse from \"Sweet Jane\". \"New Age\" was changed as well: as originally recorded, its closing line (\"It's the beginning of a new age\") was repeated many more times. A brief interlude in \"Rock and Roll\" was also removed. (Years later, the album would be reissued with the edits restored.) On the other hand, Yule has pointed that the album was to all intents and purposes finished when Reed left the band and that Reed had been aware of most if not all of the edits. The few weeks between Reed's departure in late August and Loaded’s arrival in the shops in September of the same year also would have left little room for the whole process of editing, reviewing, mastering and pressing.\n\n1970 onwards\n\nAlthough Loaded's spin-off single \"Who Loves the Sun\" did nothing, the album itself is something of a muted triumph. \"Sweet Jane\" and \"Rock and Roll\" became U.S. radio favorites, and the band, featuring Walter Powers III on bass, and Doug Yule promoted to lead vocals and guitar, went on the road once more, playing the East Coast of the U.S. and Europe. By that time, however, Sterling Morrison had obtained a B.A. degree in English, and left the group for an academic career with the University of Texas at Austin. His replacement was singer/keyboard player Willie Alexander. The band played shows in England, Wales, and the Netherlands, some of which are collected on the 2001 box set Final V.U. (Longtime fans began mocking the new lineup as the \"Velveteen Underground\", perhaps unfairly.)\n\nIn 1972 Atlantic released Live at Max's Kansas City, a live bootleg of one of the Velvet Underground's final performances with Reed, recorded by fan Brigid Polk. By this time Doug Yule was once again touring the United Kingdom, this time backed with hired hands as Sesnick had sent home Tucker, Powers and Alexander, effectively ending their time with the band. Later that year, Sesnick managed to secure a recording contract with Polydor Records in England, and Yule recorded Squeeze under the Velvet Underground name with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice. Squeeze is a controversial item among Velvet fans, most of whom flatly decline to consider any post-Lou Reed material as worthwhile. Rarely heard before the advent of Internet audio file sharing, the album's perceived Middle of the road content is sometimes dismissed out of hand by Velvets fans. Although the album technically is a Velvet Underground release, it is properly Doug Yule's debut solo album and it might have fared far better if it had been labeled as such, given the actual quality of most of the tracks, some of which would not have been out of place on Loaded. (Interestingly, Yule was actually in the group longer than Cale.)\n\nPost-VU developments (1973-1990)\n\nReed and Cale, in the meantime, developed solo careers. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a tugboat captain for several years. Maureen Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in a number of touring bands, among others with Tucker's band. In 1988, erstwhile singer Nico died of a brain hemorrhage while bicycling on the island of Ibiza.\n\nReunions (1990 and 1992-1994)\n\nIn 1990, Reed and Cale released Songs for Drella, dedicated to the recently deceased Andy Warhol. (\"Drella\" was a nickname Warhol had adopted, a combination of \"Dracula\" and \"Cinderella\".) Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the V.U. broke up, Songs for Drella was the first time the mercurial pair had worked together in decades, and rumors of a reunion began to circulate, fueled by the one-off appearance by Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker to play \"Heroin\" as the encore to a brief Songs for Drella set in Jouy-en-Josas, France.\n\nThe same lineup briefly reunited from 1992–1994, resulting in a European tour — both headlining and opening a few concerts for U2 — and a live album, Live MCMXCIII. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had performed with the group.\n\nBefore the band could tour the U.S. or record — an MTV Unplugged album was proposed — Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more. The definitive end to the band's checkered career came when Sterling Morrison died of cancer in 1995. Reed's death in 2013 put a permanent end to any hopes of further Velvet Underground reunions; tributes poured out from all corners of the internet upon the news.\n\nIn recent years, the band's first four albums have been reissued with expanded box sets featuring two to five discs' worth of bonus content. An archival series of live recordings has also been issued as The Complete Matrix Tapes, which has been praised both for its audio fidelity and for the quality of the performances (many of the recordings here were initially the source of the band's acclaimed 1969 Live album, but the sound quality has been further cleaned up).\n\nSelected discography:\n\n1967 - The Velvet Underground & Nico\n1968 - White Light/White Heat\n1969 - The Velvet Underground\n1970 - Loaded\n1972 - Live at Max's Kansas City\n1973 - Squeeze\n1974 - 1969: The Velvet Underground Live\n1985 - VU (rarities compilation)\n1986 - Another View (rarities compilation)\n1993 - Live MCMXCIII\n1995 - Peel Slowly and See (box set)\n2001 - Final V.U. 1971-1973 (live)\n2001 - The Quine Tapes (live)\n2015 - The Complete Matrix Tapes (live) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_nl": "The Velvet Underground was een experimentele rockgroep uit New York die actief was van 1964 tot 1973. Hoewel de groep destijds geen noemenswaardig commercieel succes boekte, geldt The Velvet Underground tegenwoordig als een van de meest vooruitstrevende en invloedrijkste rockgroepen aller tijden.\n\nDe klassieke bezetting van de groep bestond uit zanger en gitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, gitarist Sterling Morrison en drummer Maureen Tucker. In 1967 verscheen hun debuutalbum The Velvet Underground & Nico, onder toeziend oog van kunstenaar Andy Warhol en met een gastrol voor zangeres Nico. Dit album wordt gezien als een mijlpaal in de rockgeschiedenis vanwege diens innovatieve combinatie van rockmuziek met aleatorische muziek, microtonaliteit en minimale muziek, begeleid door taboedoorbrekende poëzie over de duistere kant van het leven, met onderwerpen als drugsgebruik, sadomasochisme en decadentisme.\n\nOp hun tweede album, White light/White heat uit 1968, klonk de groep nog rauwer en compromislozer dan voorheen. Vanwege meningsverschillen met Reed verliet Cale de groep in 1968 en werd hij vervangen door Doug Yule.

      "biography_pt": "The Velvet Underground foi uma influente banda de rock norte-americana, formada em 1964 por Lou Reed (voz e guitarra), Sterling Morrison (guitarra), John Cale (baixo), Doug Yule (que substituiu Cale em 1968), Nico (voz), Angus MacAlise (bateria) e Maureen Tucker (que substituiu Angus MacAlise).\n\nO Velvet Underground foi uma banda de vanguarda da década de 60, caracterizada por um estilo experimental, pouco comercial para a época. A banda alcançou, por este motivo, durante seus poucos anos de existência, apenas uma pequena fração do reconhecimento público quanto ao grande mérito criativo e inventivo que hoje a faz ser citada unanimemente pela crítica especializada como um dos poucos grupos realmente essenciais da história do rock'n'roll. Parte deste pouco reconhecimento experimentado, no entanto, deve-se ao contato dos membros do grupo com outros grandes nomes da vanguarda artística novaiorquina, e, em especial, com o artista plástico norte-americano Andy Warhol, que se dizia cansado da pintura e promovia incursões por outros campos artísticos como a música e o cinema em sua The Factory.\n\nWarhol agregou a seu redor um grande grupo de artistas independentes daquele período através desta postura, incluindo Lou Reed, Nico, e todo o grupo; mas sua influência sobre a banda por vezes é mal interpretada: há uma tendência equivocada a considerá-lo uma espécie de \"mentor intelectual\" do grupo quando, na verdade, grande parte das canções deste já haviam sido escritas (e por consequência, sua proposta artística já estava definida) antes do contato com ele. Andy Warhol, apesar de financiador, nunca exerceu grande influência sobre os temas a serem abordados nas músicas ou sobre a estética melódica em si, de forma que uma relação entre a música de Lou Reed e a Pop Art de Warhol seria, na melhor das hipóteses, extremamente sutil; um reflexo da convivência entre os artistas, apenas. No entanto ele teve forte influência em um importante episódio da história da banda: inclusão de Nico como vocalista em seu álbum de estréria, que ocorreu por imposição de Andy Warhol, mesmo sob protestos de membros do grupo. Como uma forma de objeção o nome do grupo no primeiro álbum foi \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\", excluindo-a, de certa forma, da banda.\n\nLogo após o lançamento do álbum \"White Light/White Heat\" a banda se desligaria tanto de Nico quanto de Andy, no entanto.\n\nO primeiro disco, The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967), notabilizou-se por uma banana na capa (feita por Andy Warhol), e também pelas composições completamente vanguardistas para os padrões da época, tratando de temas como drogas (\"I'm Waiting For The Man\" e \"Heroin\"), sadomasoquismo (\"Venus In Furs\"), prostitutas (\"There She Goes Again\"), e até ocultismo (\"The Black Angel's Death Song\"). As vendas do LP, no entanto, foram pífias, mas existe uma lenda na qual quem o comprou montou uma banda após ouvi-lo - por exemplo, artistas como Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Sonic Youth, Jesus and Mary Chain, Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead e The Strokes foram influenciados pelo Velvet Underground.\n\nGravado em poucos dias, \"White Light/White Heat\" foi lançado no início de 1968. Após esse álbum (que é mais barulhento e tão ousado quanto o seu antecessor, e conta com clássicos como a faixa-título, \"Here She Comes Now\" e \"Sister Ray\", John Cale, responsável pelos experimentalismos musicais, saiu da banda, que passou a ter Lou Reed, de maior apelo artístico e poético, como único líder.\n\nNo ano seguinte, veio o 3º álbum, chamado simplesmente de \"The Velvet Underground\". Ele expõe um som mais acústico e introspectivo do que os anteriores, e é recheado de ótimas composições como \"Candy Says\", \"What Goes On\", \"Beginning To See The Light\".\n\nO derradeiro trabalho com Lou Reed ainda na banda foi \"Loaded\", que conta com três das músicas mais famosas do VU: \"Who Loves The Sun\", \"Sweet Jane\" e \"Rock and Roll\". Após a saída do vocalista em 71, a banda ainda continuou na ativa pelos dois anos seguintes e até lançou um LP (\"Squeeze\"), mas o mesmo sequer é considerado parte de sua discografia oficial.\n\nO ambiente natural de criação e trabalho do VU era a chamada \"The Factory\", prédio alugado por Warhol e decorado por Billy Name, para reunir seus companheiros exóticos.\n\nO interesse pela banda voltou a crescer no fim dos anos 1980, quando John Cale e Lou Reed voltaram a trabalhar juntos e gravaram, em 1989, um disco em homenagem a Andy Warhol chamado \"Songs For Drella\" (que era um apelido do artista, uma corruptela \"Drácula\" com \"Cinderella\") Durante um dos shows para mostrar o disco em Paris, em julho de 1990, a dupla convidou Sterling Morrison e Maureen Tucker para tocarem, juntos, a clássica \"Heroin\". Em 1993 o Velvet se reuniu para alguns shows, que culminaram num álbum duplo, \"Live MCMXCIII\", com as principais músicas da carreira da banda.\n\nO VU sempre foi conhecido pelo som alternativo, desvinculado de interesses comerciais e que focalizava quase sempre temas relacionados ao submundo (narcóticos, prostituição, criminalidade, etc). Demoraram anos para serem reconhecidos pelo grande trabalho, o que só prova o quanto a sonoridade deles estava bem à frente de sua época.",
