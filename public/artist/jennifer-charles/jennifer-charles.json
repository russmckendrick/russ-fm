  "biography": "Jennifer Charles (b. November 15, 1968, Washington, D.C.) is a singer and composer. Along with Oren Bloedow, she co-founded the New York band Elysian Fields.\n\nBiography\n\nWhile Charles was growing up, her mother was a singer in Washington clubs and her father had a radio show that played jazz songs. Charles studied theater; She appeared in plays and experimental theatre at places like The Studio and The Source.\nUpon graduating from N.Y.U. (B.F.A. Tisch Sch of Arts), besides acting, she supported herself with a variety of jobs such as waitressing, working as an artists model, singing jazz and torch songs in a piano bar, and curating a performance/poetry series at the original Knitting Factory.\nElysian Fields were founded in 1995, and have released four full length records (five counting one produced by Steve Albini that was suppressed). They have also contributed to many compilation CDs including the first song on John Zorn's Serge Gainsbourg album. This song, their rendition of \"Les Amours Perdues\", also appeared in Lea Pool's film \"Emporte Moi\".\nBesides co-leading Elysian Fields, Charles also works on other projects. She and Bloedow recorded La Mar Enfortuna featuring renditions of Sephardic and Ladino songs. [1]\nCharles also makes up one third of the band Lovage , along with Dan the Automator and Mike Patton; they recorded an album called \"Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By\" for which she co-wrote and sung most of the material, which became something of a cult album favorite.
