      "biography": "Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band formed in 1967 in London.\nThe only original member present in the band is its eponymous drummer, Mick Fleetwood. Despite band founder Peter Green naming the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood, McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts. The keyboardist, Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.\nThe two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, with more pop-orientation, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song \"Dreams\", which was the band's first and only U.S. number one) and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth highest selling album of all time.\nThe band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with the line-up including Bob Welch, and also during the 1990s which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997, and more recently, the departure of Christine McVie.",

      "editorial_notes": "When Mick Fleetwood walked into Sound City studios in 1974, he wasn’t just looking for a place to record, he was looking for a place to start over. The band had lost four vocalists in as many years, and were on the wane both critically and commercially. So when producer Ken Olsen played Fleetwood an album by a middling folk-rock duo called Buckingham Nicks (just to test the sound), and Fleetwood liked the guitar playing, he figured, why not? Even when Buckingham said he and Nicks were a package deal, Fleetwood was unfazed: After all, they’d met, gotten along, and figured it might be interesting to have two female singer-songwriters in a band, not to mention two couples.\n\nWhy does <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> work so well? Balance. Fleetwood and John McVie—the band’s rhythm section—came from blues, but never quite crossed the threshold into hard rock, and they took to their new pop material without friction. Buckingham the chippy perfectionist (“Monday Morning”) is a foil for Nicks the mystic (“Rhiannon”), and Nicks the West Coast Earth mama (“Landslide”) a foil for Christine McVie the sophisticate (“Warm Ways”). Together they resolve the oxymoron not just of ”soft rock”, but of “folk pop”, creating, as though through spontaneous combustion, a sound commercial enough to sell millions, and personal enough to make those millions feel like the music is whispering something secret about their own lives.\n\nOn being reminded by John McVie that they were supposed to be a blues band, Olsen famously assured him that what they were doing now was a much faster way to the bank. But the beauty of the album’s creation is that nobody in the band seemed to expect it, and everyone shared in it equally. As Mick Fleetwood later put it, Buckingham Nicks didn’t join Fleetwood Mac—the two bands became one.",

            "content": "It's unfair to say that Fleetwood Mac had no pop pretensions prior to the addition of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to the lineup in 1975. When they were led by Bob Welch they often flirted with pop, even recording the first version of the unabashedly smooth and sappy \"Sentimental Lady,\" which would later be one of the defining soft rock hits of the late '70s. Still, there's no denying that 1975's Fleetwood Mac represents not just the rebirth of the band, but in effect a second debut for the group -- the introduction of a band that would dominate the sound of American and British mainstream pop for the next seven years. In fact, in retrospect, it's rather stunning how thoroughly Buckingham and Nicks, who had previously recorded as a duo and were romantically entangled in the past, overtook the British blues band. As soon as the Californian duo came onboard, Fleetwood Mac turned into a West Coast pop/rock band, transforming the very identity of the band and pushing the band's other songwriter, keyboardist Christine McVie, to a kindred soft rock sound. It could have all been too mellow if it weren't for the nervy, restless spirit of Buckingham, whose insistent opener, \"Monday Morning,\" sets the tone for the rest of the album, as well the next few years of the group's career. Surging with a pushily melodic chorus and a breezy Californian feel, the song has little to do with anything the Mac had done before this, and it is a positively brilliant slice of pop songwriting, simultaneously urgent and timeless. After that barnstorming opener, Buckingham lies back a bit, contributing only two other songs -- a cover of Richard Curtis' \"Blue Letter,\" the second best up-tempo song here, and the closer, \"I'm So Afraid\" -- while the rest of the album is given over to the wily spirits of Nicks and McVie, whose singles \"Rhiannon,\" \"Say You Love Me,\" and \"Over My Head\" deservedly made this into a blockbuster. But a bandmember's contribution can never be reduced to his own tracks, and Buckingham not only gives the production depth, he motivates the rest of the band, particularly Nicks and McVie, to do great work, not just on the hit singles but the album tracks that give this record depth. It was diverse without being forced, percolating with innovative ideas, all filtered through an accessible yet sophisticated sensibility. While Rumours had more hits and Tusk was an inspired work of mad genius, Fleetwood Mac wrote the blueprint for Californian soft rock of the late '70s and was the standard the rest were judged by. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Fleetwood+Mac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
