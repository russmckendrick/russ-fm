      "biography": "Cat Stevens became a convert to Islam in 1977, after a near-death experience. He adopted the name Yusuf Islam in 1979, and became an outspoken advocate for the religion.\nRecently in Nov. 2006, his first pop album after 28 years, \"An Other Cup\", was released under the name Yusuf.\nHe currently lives in London with his wife and children, where he is an active member of the Muslim community.\nFollowing Ayatollah Khomeini's February 14, 1989 death fatwa against author Salman Rushdie, he made statements that were interpreted as endorsing the killing of Rushdie. This generated a furor among a number of celebrities and free-speech activists in the West who spoke out about his comments on radio stations and newspaper editorials. On February 21, 1989, Yusuf Islam addressed students at Kingston University in London about his conversion to Islam and was asked about the controversy in the Muslim world and the fatwa calling for Salman Rushdie's execution. He replied, \"He must be killed. The Qur'an makes it clear - if someone defames the prophet, then he must die.\"\n He founded, and is chairman of, the Small Kindness charity, which initially assisted famine victims in Africa and now supports thousands of orphans and families in the Balkans, Indonesia, and Iraq. Islam also founded the charity Muslim Aid, but left as founding Chairman in 1999. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Yusuf+Islam\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His 1972 album Catch Bull at Four sold half a million copies in the first two weeks of release alone and was Billboard's number-one LP for three consecutive weeks. He also earned two ASCAP songwriting awards in consecutive years for \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\"; the song has been a hit single for four different artists. Some of his other hit songs include, \"Father and Son\", \"Wild World\", \"Peace Train\", \"Moonshadow\" and \"Morning Has Broken\".\n\nIn December 1977, Stevens converted to Islam and adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all his guitars for charity and left his music career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community.Stevens became a convert to Islam in 1978 after a near-death experience. He adopted the name Yusuf Islam and became an outspoken advocate for the religion. Following his conversion, Yusuf abandoned his previous career as a pop star, with which he had always been uncomfortable.
