      "biography": "Rush were a Canadian rock band formed in 1968 in Toronto, that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their 1974 self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.\n\nRush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with Fly by Night (1975), 2112 (1976), A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984) and Counterparts (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.\n\nRush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.\n\nAs of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nRush (1974)\nFly by Night (1975)\nCaress of Steel (1975)\n2112 (1976)\nA Farewell to Kings (1977)\nHemispheres (1978)\nPermanent Waves (1980)\nMoving Pictures (1981)\nSignals (1982)\nGrace Under Pressure (1984)\nPower Windows (1985)\nHold Your Fire (1987)\nPresto (1989)\nRoll the Bones (1991)\nCounterparts (1993)\nTest for Echo (1996)\nVapor Trails (2002)\nSnakes & Arrows (2007)\nClockwork Angels (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Grace Under Pressure is the tenth studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1984 (see 1984 in music). A nickname for the album is \"P/G\" (grace under pressure).\n\nThe album is notable for the radical new influences it displayed, especially reggae and ska. It is also notable as being the first Rush album that had no program music.\n\nFollowing the amicable departure of Terry Brown as producer, Rush initially approached Steve Lillywhite to produce the album. All three members of Rush and Lillywhite were in agreement, but shortly before recording sessions were to begin, Lillywhite pulled out, saying he was not right for the band. Rush eventually produced the album themselves, with assistance from Peter Henderson, whose previous credits included Supertramp, Frank Zappa and King Crimson. Lillywhite apparently pulled out due to his desire to produce an album for the NYC band Crossfire Choir, who had agreed to record in London where Lillywhite could be close to his new wife, Kirsty MacColl.\n\nOne track, \"Red Sector A\", is notable for its allusions to The Holocaust, inspired by Geddy Lee's memories of his mother's stories about the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, where she was held prisoner. \"Between the Wheels\" is one of the band's most synth-driven songs since Subdivisions from Signals. While the album's opening track, \"Distant Early Warning\", has been interpreted as dealing with the pressure involving the aftermath of nuclear holocaust, Peart deumurred in a contemporaneous interview, saying, \"It's about a lot of stuff.\" \n\n\"The Enemy Within\" is part one of the \"Fear\" series of songs that started with Part III on Moving Pictures released in 1981. This track incorporates ska influences into their music.\n\nGrace Under Pressure reached #10 on The Billboard 200 and went Platinum in the US upon its 1984 release. On the back cover is a remarkable band portrait by the photographer Yousuf Karsh. The original vinyl pressing also featured a photo depicting an egg being held in a C-clamp.\n\nIn the liner notes (in which parts are written in French), Rush included a small phrase, which states, \"et toujours notre bon vielle ami — Broon\". Broon was a nickname given to former Rush producer Terry Brown, who produced all of Rush's albums up from Fly By Night to their previous album, Signals. The quote translates to \"and always our good old friend\"; it is a special thanks to the producer who helped Rush break out into the mainstream.\n\nBackground\nDuring the Signals tour, Rush began by meeting with producer Terry Brown in Miami, calmly informing him that they wanted to move on. They had become increasingly unhappy with the sound of the Signals album, and they were also keen to see how they would work with someone other than Brown.\n\nThey began going through credits on various albums to search for the right producer to contact. They met with various producers on the 1983 European tour, who were mostly English. One unknown producer decided to work with them and later changed his mind. Steve Lillywhite was to work with them but also pulled out.\n\nIn the meantime, Rush began to jam on what would become \"Between the Wheels\", created demos of \"Red Sector A\" and \"The Body Electric\", and wrote \"Kid Gloves\" and \"Afterimage\". Still without a producer, \"Distant Early Warning\" and \"The Enemy Within\" were recorded and they began work on \"Red Lenses\". They played these to production candidates and discussed certain songs, eventually settling on Peter Henderson.\n\nThey headed to Le Studio, deciding on the title Grace Under Pressure for the album. They tweaked the sounds of the instruments and started on \"Distant Early Warning\". Lyrics were inspired by the various current events found in the Toronto Globe & Mail, mainly inspiring \"Distant Early Warning\", \"Red Lenses\", and \"Between the Wheels\". After a few months, the mixing stage had begun, and Neil Peart discussed the details of the cover art with Hugh Syme. Fourteen hour days were the norm in the studio. The final discussion was on who would direct the music videos.\n\n\n\nTrack listing\nMusic and lyrics by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart.\n\n Side one\n\"Distant Early Warning\" – 4:56 \n\"Afterimage\" – 5:03 \n\"Red Sector A\" – 5:09 \n\"The Enemy Within (Part I of Fear)\" – 4:34 \n\nSide two\n\"The Body Electric\" – 4:59 \n\"Kid Gloves\" – 4:17 \n\"red lenses\" – 4:41 \nWritten as \"red lenses\" on the lyric sheet.
