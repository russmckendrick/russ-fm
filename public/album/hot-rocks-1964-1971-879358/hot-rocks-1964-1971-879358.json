      "biography": "The Rolling Stones is an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, got them gigs, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.\n\nRooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" (1965), \"Get Off of My Cloud\" (1965), and \"Paint It Black\" (1966) became international number-one hits. Aftermath (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by The Daily Telegraph to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit \"Ruby Tuesday\"/\"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and experimented with psychedelic rock on Their Satanic Majesties Request. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1968) and \"Honky Tonk Women\" (1969), and albums such as Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and \"Gimme Shelter\". Let It Bleed was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.\n\nJones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as \"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\". Sticky Fingers (1971), which yielded \"Brown Sugar\" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. Exile on Main St. (1972), featuring \"Tumbling Dice\", and Goats Head Soup (1973), yielding the hit ballad \"Angie\", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ron Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: Some Girls (1978), featuring \"Miss You\", and Tattoo You (1981), featuring \"Start Me Up\". Steel Wheels (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by Voodoo Lounge (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts' death. Their 2016 album, Blue & Lonesome, became their twelfth UK number-one album.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Billboard magazine and Rolling Stone have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones\n\nStudio albums\nThe Rolling Stones / England's Newest Hit Makers (1964)\n12 X 5 (1964)\nThe Rolling Stones No. 2 / The Rolling Stones, Now!

It became the Rolling Stones' best-selling release of their career and an enduring and popular retrospective. While the album carries most of the band's biggest hits during their first decade, it does drop a few of them to include standout album tracks such as \"Play With Fire\", \"Under My Thumb\" and \"Gimme Shelter\" giving listeners a more well-rounded impression of the Rolling Stones' music in this era. The iconic cover photo of silhouettes within silhouettes is by photographer Ron Raffaelli.\n\nHot Rocks 1964–1971 peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart and, as of February 2020, the album has spent 324 weeks on the chart. The album was certified 12× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album was not released in the UK until 21 May 1990, to coincide with the Urban Jungle Tour, reaching No. 3 and, as of March 2020, it has spent 241 weeks on the UK Top 200.\n\nRobert Christgau rated the album a B-, writing \"If you don't like the Stones, this might serve as a sampler... Look, here's how it works. Except for Satanic Majesties, which isn't represented here, all of their '60s studio albums are musts.\"\n\nIn August 2002, Hot Rocks 1964–1971 was reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Hot+Rocks+1964-1971\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
