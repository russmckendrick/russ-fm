      "biography": "Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.\n\nFollowing personal tensions, Wright was pushed out of Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters decision to leave in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was created using unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions, along with new recordings. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason released the most recent Pink Floyd recording, the song \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" in protest of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  As of 2024, the band is back on hiatus, with Gilmour stating his willingness to reconvene under the right circumstances.\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Album Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \"Money\" (1973), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), \"Not Now John\" (1983), \"On the Turning Away\" (1987) and \"High Hopes\" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd\n\nStudio albums\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)\nA Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\nMore (1969)\nUmmagumma (1969)\nAtom Heart Mother (1970)\nMeddle (1971)\nObscured by Clouds (1972)\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973)\nWish You Were Here (1975)\nAnimals (1977)\nThe Wall (1979)\nThe Final Cut (1983)\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)\nThe Division Bell (1994)\nThe Endless River (2014) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "A Collection of Great Dance Songs is a compilation album by Pink Floyd released on 23 November 1981 on Harvest/EMI in the UK and Columbia Records in the U.S. originally. The album was released against the will of Roger Waters.\n\nThe title is facetious, given that Pink Floyd is not known for making particularly danceable music. This is perhaps evidenced by the album art, which featured a photograph of ballroom dancers guyed to the ground so they cannot move. The Hipgnosis design team did the cover under the pseudonym TCP after falling out with Roger Waters a few years earlier. The inner sleeve had pictures of dancers in either a white (UK) or black (U.S.) background. The picture labels were a black background with blue lines and red sketch lined dancers on side one and reverse on side two.\n\nThe album contains alternate mixes of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" (which comprises parts 1, 2, 4 and 7) and \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\" (which combines the intro from the single mix with the album version which fades out during the \"if you don't eat your meat\" ending). Also, the track \"Money\" was re-recorded as Capitol Records refused to let Columbia Records in the U.S. use the track. David Gilmour re-recorded the track himself playing all of the drums, guitars, keyboards, bass guitar and vocals and co-producing the song with James Guthrie. Dick Parry reprised his saxophone role on the track. There are some slight differences between the re-recorded version and original, mainly in certain sections of the saxophone and guitar solos. The drumming is noticeably different from Nick Mason's.\n\nThe album was certified Gold by the RIAA on 29 January 1982 and Platinum on 6 July 1989 and Double Platinum in August, 2001. The album reached #37 on the UK charts and #31 in the U.S.. Columbia issued the remastered CD in 1997 in the U.S. and most of the world save Europe. Then a 1997 remastered CD was re-released in 2000 on Capitol Records in the U.S. and EMI for the rest of the world including Europe. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/A+Collection+of+Great+Dance+Songs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
