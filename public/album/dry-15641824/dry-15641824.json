Born in Dorset, England, Harvey first gained widespread acclaim in the early 1990s with her debut album \"Dry,\" establishing herself as a powerful voice in the music scene. Over the years, her work has earned her multiple awards, including the Mercury Prize for her albums \"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea\" and \"Let England Shake.\"\n\nIn 2023, Harvey released her 10th studio album, \"I Inside the Old Year Dying,\" a work deeply inspired by her epic poem Orlam. The album explores themes of first love, loss, and the search for meaning, showcasing her continuous evolution as an artist. Produced by longtime collaborators Flood and John Parish, the album features tracks like \"A Child’s Question, August\" and \"Seem an I,\" blending haunting melodies with introspective lyrics.\n\nAlongside her music career, Harvey has explored various creative avenues. She has worked on soundtracks, poetry, and even collaborated on theatrical projects, demonstrating her versatility as an artist. Harvey's ability to seamlessly navigate between different forms of expression has solidified her status as a multifaceted creator.",

The album was recorded at The Icehouse, a local studio in Yeovil, United Kingdom. The first 5000 LPs and first 1000 CDs included demo versions of the album's tracks, being subsequently released in the United States on Indigo Records in the US. Both versions were released in 1992.\n\nSpeaking to Filter magazine in 2004, Harvey said of her debut album: \"\"Dry\" is the first chance I ever had to make a record and I thought it would be my last. So, I put everything I had into it. It was a very extreme record. It was a great joy for me to be able to make it. I never thought I'd have that opportunity, so I felt like I had to get everything on it as well as I possibly could, because it was probably my only chance. It felt very extreme for that reason.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/PJ+Harvey/Dry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
