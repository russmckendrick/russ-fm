      "biography": "Pulp is a British band formed in Sheffield in 1978, fronted by lead singer and songwriter Jarvis Cocker. The group is known for their sharp, observational lyrics and a blend of pop, rock, and disco elements. They rose to fame in the mid-1990s as part of the Britpop movement, achieving significant success with their fifth album, His 'n' Hers (1994). However, it was their 1995 album, Different Class, that cemented their place in music history, featuring iconic tracks like \"Common People\" and \"Disco 2000.\" These songs offered witty and incisive commentaries on British life and class issues, resonating with a wide audience.\n\nFollowing Different Class, Pulp continued to explore darker and more introspective themes with albums like This Is Hardcore (1998) and We Love Life (2001). These later works demonstrated the band's versatility and depth, exploring complex emotional landscapes and societal critiques. Jarvis Cocker's charismatic presence and lyrical storytelling have been central to Pulp's enduring appeal, making them one of the most influential bands of their era. Their music continues to be celebrated for its intelligence, humor, and cultural relevance.",

However, the Sheffield troupe weren’t necessarily interested in joining (or conforming to) any sort of movement. That was obvious from the <i>Different Class</i> album artwork, which contained a prominent plea: “Please understand. We don’t want no trouble. We just want the right to be different. That’s all.” It was also obvious from the pointed lyrics penned by vocalist Jarvis Cocker, a lanky presence known for arch statements, Bowie-esque vocal tone and unsparing social commentary.<br />\nLook no further than the neon-hued, synth-punk dance-floor anthem “Common People”, a cutting portrayal of a rich clubber who wants to “do whatever common people do”, which Cocker told <i>The Face</i> targeted “a certain voyeurism on the part of the middle classes, a certain romanticism of working-class culture, and a desire to slum it a bit”. Other songs were just as direct, whether slamming empty hedonism (“Sorted for E’s & Wizz”) or praising the value of smarts over wealth when faced with class warfare (“Mis-Shapes”). <br />\nSonically, <i>Different Class</i> was equally refined. Although other Britpop stars drew inspiration from The Beatles and the Stones, ’70s power pop and colourful ’80s New Wave, Pulp favoured debonair textures indebted to noir music and moody art rock—as heard on the strings-swept, ’60s-mod-pop homage “Something Changed” and the eerie, Leonard Cohen-reminiscent “F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.” <i>Different Class</i> was a commercial hit whose anthems for misfits and outsiders elevated the quality of mainstream music discourse.",
