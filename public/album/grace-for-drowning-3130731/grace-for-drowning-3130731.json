      "biography": "Steven Wilson (born Steven John Wilson on November 3, 1967, in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and record producer, most closely associated with the progressive rock genre. Currently a solo artist, he became known as the founder, lead guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter of the British rock band Porcupine Tree, as well as being a member of several other bands.\n\nWilson is self-taught as a producer, audio engineer, multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter. Under his own name, he has released the albums Insurgentes  (2008), Grace for Drowning  (2011), The Raven That Refused to Sing (and Other Stories)  (2013), Hand. Cannot. Erase.  (2015), To the Bone (2017), and The Future Bites  (2021). He also released a EP, 4 ½  (2016), as well as a series of singles titled Cover Version (released online between 2003 and 2010; released worldwide as a compilation in 2014). His other solo projects can also be found attributed to monikers of his, such as Bass Communion and Incredible Expanding Mindfuck.\n\nHe is perhaps best known as the frontman for progressive rock band, Porcupine Tree, for whom he was the sole member during the 1980s and early 1990s. His projects are numerous however, including collaboration with Aviv Geffen as Blackfield; a long-running partnership with Tim Bowness, known as No-Man; teaming up with Dirk Serries in Continuum; as well as a joint album with Opeth's frontman, Mikael Åkerfeldt in Storm Corrosion.\n\n\nWilson employs synthesizers and programmed music along with live instruments to create a unique atmosphere for each song he works on, including otherwise-simple pop tunes. In addition to his prolific musical output, Steven has crafted a reputation for the high production quality of his music, and has undertaken production duties with such high-profile artists as Opeth, Dream Theater, Jim Matheos of Fates Warning, Anathema, Orphaned Land,  Marillion, Fish, Pendulum, Yoko Ono, and friend Robert Fripp. He is also part way through remixing the albums of King Crimson and other classic artists' back catalogues into surround sound and new stereo mixes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steven+Wilson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Grace for Drowning is the second studio solo album by Steven Wilson, producer, songwriter, and frontman of Porcupine Tree. It was released by Kscope Music Records on September 26, 2011.\n\nAfter the release of his first solo album, Insurgentes, Steven Wilson spent time on a number of his other projects. These include Porcupine Tree's album The Incident in 2009, Blackfield's third album Welcome to My DNA, on March 28, 2011, and an on-going project with Mikael Åkerfeldt, the lead singer of the band Opeth, tentatively named \"Storm Corrosion\". However, amongst these projects, in 2010, he announced that he had started working on his second solo album as well.\n\nIn early June 2011, Wilson launched a minisite for the new album revealing the album's name and album art photographed by his long time collaborator Lasse Hoile. Additionally, a free download of the track \"Remainder the Black Dog\" was also added. Sound and Vision magazine's website premiered the video of \"Track One\" on August 10, 2011. Not long after, Yahoo! Music debuted the music video for \"Index\". On August 16, WNYC's website premiered a free download for the radio edit of \"Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye\". A videoclip for \"Remainder the Black Dog\" was finally released on August 31, through Guitar World magazine's website.\n\nUpon completion of the album, Wilson said:\n\"'Insurgentes' was an important step for me into something new. This record takes that as a starting point, but it’s more experimental and more eclectic. For me the golden period for music was the late sixties and early seventies, when the album became the primary means of artistic expression, when musicians liberated themselves from the 3 minute pop song format, and started to draw on jazz and classical music especially, combining it with the spirit of psychedelia to create “journeys in sound” I guess you could call them. So without being retro, my album is a kind of homage to that spirit. There’s everything from  Morricone-esque film themes to choral music to piano ballads to a 23 minute progressive jazz –inspired piece.

It was released by Kscope Music Records on September 26, 2011.\n\nAfter the release of his first solo album, Insurgentes, Steven Wilson spent time on a number of his other projects. These include Porcupine Tree's album The Incident in 2009, Blackfield's third album Welcome to My DNA, on March 28, 2011, and an on-going project with Mikael Åkerfeldt, the lead singer of the band Opeth, tentatively named \"Storm Corrosion\". However, amongst these projects, in 2010, he announced that he had started working on his second solo album as well.\n\nIn early June 2011, Wilson launched a minisite for the new album revealing the album's name and album art photographed by his long time collaborator Lasse Hoile. Additionally, a free download of the track \"Remainder the Black Dog\" was also added. Sound and Vision magazine's website premiered the video of \"Track One\" on August 10, 2011. Not long after, Yahoo! Music debuted the music video for \"Index\". On August 16, WNYC's website premiered a free download for the radio edit of \"Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye\". A videoclip for \"Remainder the Black Dog\" was finally released on August 31, through Guitar World magazine's website.\n\nUpon completion of the album, Wilson said:\n\"'Insurgentes' was an important step for me into something new. This record takes that as a starting point, but it’s more experimental and more eclectic. For me the golden period for music was the late sixties and early seventies, when the album became the primary means of artistic expression, when musicians liberated themselves from the 3 minute pop song format, and started to draw on jazz and classical music especially, combining it with the spirit of psychedelia to create “journeys in sound” I guess you could call them. So without being retro, my album is a kind of homage to that spirit. There’s everything from  Morricone-esque film themes to choral music to piano ballads to a 23 minute progressive jazz –inspired piece. I've actually used a few jazz musicians this time, which is something I picked up from my work remixing the King Crimson records\"\n\nThe special edition of the album is going to release on Blu-Ray video disc with the music playing in 5.1 surround sound and accompanying visuals and videos for each track, making it the first-ever rock album released primarily as a Blu-Ray video disc.\n\nMentioned collaborations to the album so far include Nic France on drums, Steve Hackett on lead guitar, Robert Fripp, Tony Levin, Nick Beggs and Trey Gunn on warr guitar, Theo Travis and Jordan Rudess, and some jazz musicians as mentioned above.\n\nDisc 1: Deform to Form a Star\n1. \t\"Grace for Drowning\" \n2. \t\"Sectarian\"\n3. \t\"Deform to Form a Star\"\n4. \t\"No Part of Me\"\n5. \t\"Postcard\"\n6. \t\"Raider Prelude\"\n7. \t\"Remainder the Black Dog\"\n\nDisc 2: Like Dust I Have Cleared from My Eye\n1. \t\"Belle de Jour\"\n2. \t\"Index\"\n3. \t\"Track One\"\n4. \t\"Raider II\"\n5. \t\"Like Dust I Have Cleared from My Eye\"\n\nDisc 3: The Map (Deluxe Edition only; Demos + Out-Takes)\n1. \t\"Home in Negative\"\n2. \t\"Fluid Tap\"\n3. \t\"The Map\"\n4. \t\"Raider Acceleration\"\n5. \t\"Black Dog Throwbacks\"\n6. \t\"Raider II (Demo Version)\"\n\nDeluxe Edition also contains:\n- 120 page hardback book.\n- Blu-Ray with 5.1 surround sound mix, high resolution stereo and additional demos.\n- Blu-Ray also contains films for five tracks (directed by Lasse Hoile), Photo galleries, hand written notes and lyrics.\n\nReception:\nBen Bland of Steroboard was postive on album and wrote: \"For a work so defiantly widescreen in its intentions as this, it is truly remarkable that there is nothing that could, or rather should, be accused of being filler or being over the top.\" Sea of Tranquility reviewer Murat Batmaz praised the production of the album, calling it \"possibly Wilson's best.\"\n\nTour:\nAccording to the Porcupine Tree fan site StarsDie.com, there will be no support acts for the ‘Grace for Drowning’ Tour. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steven+Wilson/Grace+for+Drowning\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
