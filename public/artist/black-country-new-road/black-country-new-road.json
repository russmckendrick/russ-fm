  "biography": "Black Country, New Road (commonly abbreviated to BCNR or BC,NR) is an English  experimental rock band formed in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom in 2018, consisting of Tyler Hyde (bass, vocals), May Kershaw (keyboard, accordion, vocals), Georgia Ellery (violin, vocals), Lewis Evans (saxophone, flute, vocals), Charlie Wayne (drums, backing vocals), and Luke Mark (guitar, backing vocals). The band's first two albums featured lead vocalist Isaac Wood, who left the band in 2022. Their sound has been described as experimental rock, post-punk and post-rock, drawing comparisons to bands such as Slint, Arcade Fire, and black midi.\n\nThe founding members of the band originally came from the band Nervous Conditions, alongside vocalist Connor Browne and drummer Jonny Pyke. However, due to sexual assault allegations against Browne, Nervous Conditions disbanded in early 2018 and reformed later that year as Black Country, New Road without Browne and Pyke.\n\nLater adding second (at the time) guitarist Luke Mark, the band gained initial attention through debut singles Athens, France and Sunglasses in 2019. Their debut album, For the first time, released in 2021, received widespread critical acclaim, was nominated for the Mercury Prize and reached No. 4 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart. Four days before the release of their 2022 second album Ants from Up There, Wood left the band, citing mental health struggles. The album received further critical acclaim, reaching No. 3 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart.\n\nThe band workshopped new material in the months following Wood's departure, eventually releasing a live album, Live at Bush Hall, in 2023.\n\nThe band's first studio album since Wood's departure, Forever Howlong, was released in April 2025.\n\nhttp://www.blackcountrynewroad.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Country,+New+Road\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
