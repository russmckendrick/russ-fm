  "biography": "There are multiple artists using this name.\n\n1. Darkside is Dave Harrington, Nicolas Jaar and Tlacael Sparza.\n2. Darkside is  an Austrian death metal band.\n3. A doomcore musician from the UK.\n4. Short lived US Rock band.\n\n1. Darkside is a musical duo composed of guitarist Dave Harrington and electronic producer Nicolas Jaar. Despite having different musical backgrounds, they found common ground through touring together and have created a unique fusion of electronic and psychedelic rock music. Nicolas Jaar rose to fame in New York City's underground techno scene and has since incorporated rock music into his work. Dave Harrington started as a bass player in experimental jazz and has expanded his skills to include other instruments and film scoring. Together, they started experimenting in the studio and produced the album \"Psych\", which explores the intersection of rock and 21st-century dance music. The album is a breakthrough for the duo and showcases their uncompromising creativity. And in 2025 a fundamental shift from their first dozen years as a band, the duo recruited their longtime friend and collaborator, the drummer and instrument designer Tlacael Esparza, to become a full-time member. The outcome is magnetic and hieroglyphic. Their third  \"Nothing\" album slips through the cracks of convention with serpentine guitars, extraterrestrial static, and cavernous drums.\n\n\n2. Darkside is an Austrian death metal band that formed in 1991. It was initially founded by bassplayer Peter Böhm and drummer Robert Grögler, who started composing and rehearsing their music. They were soon joined by Peter Durst who added vocals and guitar to the band. In spring of 1992, the trio recorded their first demo, \"Depression,\" which was a collection of four powerful death metal tracks. The band later added a keyboard player, Wolfgang Süssenbeck, to bring more melody and variety to their music.\n\nHowever, just before they were ready to record their second demo, Durst started experiencing health problems with his right arm and the band was forced to look for a substitute. Herbert Knöchel filled in the vacant place and eventually became the fifth member of Darkside. The second demo, \"Herbst,\" showed the progression of the band's style and received excellent reviews in the Czech press.\n\nThanks to their friendship with Krabathor, a death metal band, Darkside had the opportunity to perform in a series of concerts in Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 1994, they recorded and released their first full-length album, \"Melancholia of a Dying World,\" which received critical acclaim in both foreign countries and the Czech Republic. The band went on tour with Carcass, Vader, and Krabathor, among others. However, Herbert Knöchel left the band in early 1995 due to personal issues.\n\nIn 1995, Darkside signed with the German record label Impact Records, which founded a sublabel, System Shock, specifically for them. Their album \"Melancholia of a Dying World\" was later licensed by the Florida-based independent label Conquest Music for the USA, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nDarkside then began work on their second album, \"Shadowfields,\" which was recorded in the Past Studio under the production of Vincent Dijkers, a Dutch producer. The album contained orchestral arrangements mixed with death metal. Throughout their career, Darkside performed in concerts and festivals, including the Attack of Fire and the legendary Horepnik-Slamdance.\n\n\n3. A doomcore musician from the UK. Has some releases with legendary Fifth Era and is also a part of Fifth Era Records and Fifth Era DJ Squad. He has also started up his own record label called Hellfire Records.\n\n\n4. A short-lived incarnation of desert rock force Yawning Man. Featuring Mario Lalli, Alfredo Hernandez, Scott Reeder & Herb Lineau. They delivered one track called 'Right's Right' for the soundtrack to the 1984 movie 'Desperate Teenage Lovedolls'. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Darkside\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "bio_content": "There are multiple artists using this name.\n\n1. Darkside is Dave Harrington, Nicolas Jaar and Tlacael Sparza.\n2. Darkside is  an Austrian death metal band.\n3. A doomcore musician from the UK.\n4. Short lived US Rock band.\n\n1. Darkside is a musical duo composed of guitarist Dave Harrington and electronic producer Nicolas Jaar. Despite having different musical backgrounds, they found common ground through touring together and have created a unique fusion of electronic and psychedelic rock music. Nicolas Jaar rose to fame in New York City's underground techno scene and has since incorporated rock music into his work. Dave Harrington started as a bass player in experimental jazz and has expanded his skills to include other instruments and film scoring. Together, they started experimenting in the studio and produced the album \"Psych\", which explores the intersection of rock and 21st-century dance music. The album is a breakthrough for the duo and showcases their uncompromising creativity. And in 2025 a fundamental shift from their first dozen years as a band, the duo recruited their longtime friend and collaborator, the drummer and instrument designer Tlacael Esparza, to become a full-time member. The outcome is magnetic and hieroglyphic. Their third  \"Nothing\" album slips through the cracks of convention with serpentine guitars, extraterrestrial static, and cavernous drums.\n\n\n2. Darkside is an Austrian death metal band that formed in 1991. It was initially founded by bassplayer Peter Böhm and drummer Robert Grögler, who started composing and rehearsing their music. They were soon joined by Peter Durst who added vocals and guitar to the band. In spring of 1992, the trio recorded their first demo, \"Depression,\" which was a collection of four powerful death metal tracks. The band later added a keyboard player, Wolfgang Süssenbeck, to bring more melody and variety to their music.\n\nHowever, just before they were ready to record their second demo, Durst started experiencing health problems with his right arm and the band was forced to look for a substitute. Herbert Knöchel filled in the vacant place and eventually became the fifth member of Darkside. The second demo, \"Herbst,\" showed the progression of the band's style and received excellent reviews in the Czech press.\n\nThanks to their friendship with Krabathor, a death metal band, Darkside had the opportunity to perform in a series of concerts in Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 1994, they recorded and released their first full-length album, \"Melancholia of a Dying World,\" which received critical acclaim in both foreign countries and the Czech Republic. The band went on tour with Carcass, Vader, and Krabathor, among others. However, Herbert Knöchel left the band in early 1995 due to personal issues.\n\nIn 1995, Darkside signed with the German record label Impact Records, which founded a sublabel, System Shock, specifically for them. Their album \"Melancholia of a Dying World\" was later licensed by the Florida-based independent label Conquest Music for the USA, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nDarkside then began work on their second album, \"Shadowfields,\" which was recorded in the Past Studio under the production of Vincent Dijkers, a Dutch producer. The album contained orchestral arrangements mixed with death metal. Throughout their career, Darkside performed in concerts and festivals, including the Attack of Fire and the legendary Horepnik-Slamdance.\n\n\n3. A doomcore musician from the UK. Has some releases with legendary Fifth Era and is also a part of Fifth Era Records and Fifth Era DJ Squad. He has also started up his own record label called Hellfire Records.\n\n\n4. A short-lived incarnation of desert rock force Yawning Man. Featuring Mario Lalli, Alfredo Hernandez, Scott Reeder & Herb Lineau. They delivered one track called 'Right's Right' for the soundtrack to the 1984 movie 'Desperate Teenage Lovedolls'. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Darkside\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
