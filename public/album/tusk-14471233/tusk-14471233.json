      "biography": "Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band formed in 1967 in London.\nThe only original member present in the band is its eponymous drummer, Mick Fleetwood. Despite band founder Peter Green naming the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood, McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts. The keyboardist, Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.\nThe two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, with more pop-orientation, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song \"Dreams\", which was the band's first and only U.S. number one) and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth highest selling album of all time.\nThe band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with the line-up including Bob Welch, and also during the 1990s which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997, and more recently, the departure of Christine McVie.",

      "editorial_notes": "The myth of <i>Tusk</i> as a gloriously self-destructive failure on which the band’s excess got the better of them is at best partly true. Yes, Lindsey Buckingham felt challenged by the energy and innovation of punk rock. Yes, he recorded vocal takes in a push-up position on the tiled floor because he thought it’d make them sound more aggressive. And if you were one of the 10 million people who bought into the smoothness of <i>Rumours</i>, the geometric abrasions of ”The Ledge”, “What Makes You Think You’re the One” and “Tusk” might make your skin crawl. As Stevie Nicks puts it, Buckingham is the kind of person who would die on his cross to make a point. So when the band’s record company encouraged them to stay their extremely lucrative course, Buckingham not only declined, he went off-road.\n\nBut to write off an album that had three Top 20 singles (“Tusk”, “Sara”, “Think About Me”) and sold several million copies says more about the band’s success than any perception of their failure. Buckingham’s contributions are amazing—a bridge between punk, art-rock and the highly constructed pop of early Brian Eno. But what makes <i>Tusk</i> remarkable as an album is hearing the band’s songwriters—Buckingham, Nicks and Christine McVie—push further into their differences without losing a shared centre. Where <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> and <i>Rumours</i> made them sound uniform and balanced, <i>Tusk</i> works like a prism, splitting their sound into its constituent parts: The mellow romanticism of McVie (“Over & Over”, “Brown Eyes”, “Honey Hi”), the ethereality of Nicks (“Sara”, “Sisters of the Moon”, “Beautiful Child”), the itchiness of Buckingham.\n\nIf you’re coming from the underground, you could wonder whether <i>Tusk</i> holds its own with Talking Heads, The Clash, Wire or even Neil Young, whose <i>Rust Never Sleeps</i> incorporated punk in an even more direct way. But most people are listening to <i>Tusk</i> because it’s an album by Fleetwood Mac, and will leave with their expectations duly screwed up.",

Buckingham’s contributions are amazing—a bridge between punk, art-rock and the highly constructed pop of early Brian Eno. But what makes <i>Tusk</i> remarkable as an album is hearing the band’s songwriters—Buckingham, Nicks and Christine McVie—push further into their differences without losing a shared centre. Where <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> and <i>Rumours</i> made them sound uniform and balanced, <i>Tusk</i> works like a prism, splitting their sound into its constituent parts: The mellow romanticism of McVie (“Over & Over”, “Brown Eyes”, “Honey Hi”), the ethereality of Nicks (“Sara”, “Sisters of the Moon”, “Beautiful Child”), the itchiness of Buckingham.\n\nIf you’re coming from the underground, you could wonder whether <i>Tusk</i> holds its own with Talking Heads, The Clash, Wire or even Neil Young, whose <i>Rust Never Sleeps</i> incorporated punk in an even more direct way. But most people are listening to <i>Tusk</i> because it’s an album by Fleetwood Mac, and will leave with their expectations duly screwed up."

            "content": "More than any other Fleetwood Mac album, Tusk is born of a particular time and place -- it could only have been created in the aftermath of Rumours, which shattered sales records, which in turn gave the group a blank check for its next album. But if they were falling apart during the making of Rumours, they were officially broken and shattered during the making of Tusk, and that disconnect between bandmembers resulted in a sprawling, incoherent, and utterly brilliant 20-track double album. At the time of its release, it was a flop, never reaching the top of the charts and never spawning a true hit single, despite two well-received Top Ten hits. Coming after the monumental Rumours, this was a huge disappointment, but the truth of the matter is that Fleetwood Mac couldn't top that success no matter how hard they tried, so it was better for them to indulge themselves and come up with something as unique as Tusk. Lindsey Buckingham directed both Fleetwood Mac and Rumours, but he dominates here, composing nearly half the album, and giving Christine McVie's and Stevie Nicks' songs an ethereal, floating quality that turns them into welcome respites from the seriously twisted immersions into Buckingham's id. This is the ultimate cocaine album -- it's mellow for long stretches, and then bursts wide open in manic, frantic explosions, such as the mounting tension on \"The Ledge\" or the rampaging \"That's Enough for Me,\" or the marching band-driven paranoia of the title track, all of which are relieved by smooth, reflective work from all three songwriters. While McVie and Nicks contribute some excellent songs, Buckingham owns this record with his nervous energy and obsessive production, winding up with a fussily detailed yet wildly messy record unlike any other. This is mainstream madness, crazier than Buckingham's idol Brian Wilson and weirder than any number of cult classics. Of course, that's why it bombed upon its original release, but Tusk is a bracing, weirdly affecting work that may not be as universal or immediate as Rumours, but is every bit as classic. As a piece of pop art, it's peerless. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Tusk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
