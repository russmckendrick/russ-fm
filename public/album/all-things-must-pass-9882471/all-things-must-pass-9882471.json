      "biography": "George Harrison MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) born in Liverpool, UK, was an English rock musician, singer-songwriter and film producer who achieved international fame as lead guitarist in The Beatles, along with mainstream success as a solo artist. George contributed to the songwriting talents of his Beatles band mates, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, firstly by adding ideas and guitar parts, and later with his distinctive style of music inspired by Eastern spirituality. Ten years after Harrison's death, and forty-two years after its first release, his classic \"Here Comes the Sun\" is the number one Beatles download on iTunes.\n\nAfter the Beatles stopped touring in 1966, George started writing more songs than could be fitted onto the albums so that by the time of the split he had built up a collection of songs, some used on his debut solo album, All Things Must Pass. The album, released in 1970, contains the two-time number one hit, \"My Sweet Lord\".\n\nHarrison is also credited for creating music benefits, notably the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh. Harrison played beside Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr, and Leon Russell to a crowd of 40,000 in Madison Square Garden, New York. The show raised over $240,000 benefiting the George Harrison Fund for Bangladesh relief.\n\nHarrison went on to release several successful solo albums, and in the late 1980s collaborated with Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, in a group called Traveling Wilburys. The group released two albums. Later, Harrison reunited with the other two surviving Beatles, after John Lennon's murder in 1980, to produce two final Beatles records, \"Free As a Bird\" and \"Real Love\" featuring the voice of Lennon, taken from home demos provided by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. The three Beatles also co-wrote a massive autobiography and television special, both titled \"The Beatles Anthology.\"\n\nBefore his death, Harrison conceived of a Cirque du Soleil show, \"Love,\" featuring remixes of Beatles music which were overseen by Beatles producer George Martin.\n\nHarrison died on November 29, 2001 after a battle with cancer, leaving behind a wife and son, Olivia and Dhani Harrison. His last album, Brainwashed, was released posthumously and featured the single \"Any Road\".\n\nA benefit concert in Harrison's memory was played on 29 November 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall. The star-studded event (featuring Eric Clapton and Monty Python, as well as former band mates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr) was released on the DVD double-album, Concert for George. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "All Things Must Pass is a triple album by English musician George Harrison. Released in November 1970, it includes the hit singles \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"What Is Life\", as well as songs such as \"Isn't It a Pity\" and the title track that were turned down by Harrison's former band, the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of his musical activities outside the Beatles during 1968–70 – with Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney & Bonnie, Billy Preston and others – and Harrison's growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The album introduced Harrison's signature sound, the slide guitar, and the spiritual themes that would be implicit throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams, titled Apple Jam. Commentators interpret Barry Feinstein's album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.\n\nProduction began at London's Abbey Road Studios in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unreleased.\n\nAll Things Must Pass was critically acclaimed on release and, with long stays at number 1 on charts around the world, commercially successful. The album was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs the latter's Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as \"Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Reflecting the general surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's post-Beatles debut, Melody Maker's Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo's first role in a talking picture and declared: \"Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!\" Several critics consider All Things Must Pass to be the best of all the Beatles' solo albums.\n\nIn March 2001, following a successful reissue campaign coinciding with its 30th anniversary, the album was certified 6x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2012, Rolling Stone placed All Things Must Pass 433rd on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\n\nCorrect track listing:\n\nA1. I'd Have You Anytime - 3:00\nA2. My Sweet Lord - 4:43\nA3. Wah-Wah - 5:38\nA4. Isn't It a Pity (version one) - 7:14\nB1. What Is Life - 4:27\nB2. If Not for You - 3:33\nB3. Behind That Locked Door - 3:10\nB4. Let It Down - 5:01\nB5. Run of the Mill - 2:53\nC1. Beware of Darkness - 3:51\nC2. Apple Scruffs - 3:09\nC3. Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll) - 3:53\nC4. Awaiting on You All - 2:47\nC5. All Things Must Pass - 2:47\nD1. I Dig Love - 4:59\nD2. Art of Dying - 3:42\nD3. Isn't It a Pity (version two) - 4:50\nD4. Hear Me Lord - 5:51\nE1. Out of the Blue - 11:17\nE2. It's Johnny's Birthday - 0:50\nE3. Plug Me In - 3:20\nF1. I Remember Jeep - 8:09\nF2. Thanks for the Pepperoni - 5:32\n\nThe remaster from 2001 moved \"Out of the Blue\" to the end of the album and inserted five bonus tracks after the first LP. The insertion of the bonus tracks into the middle of the album's running order was regarded as an unwelcome addition to the album, particularly since there was enough space to include the album's first two LPs on the first CD and the last LP with the bonus tracks on the second. The running order on this edition is as follows:\n\nDisc 1:\n1. I'd Have You Anytime - 3:00\n2. My Sweet Lord - 4:43\n3. Wah-Wah - 5:38\n4. Isn't It a Pity (version one) - 7:14\n5. What Is Life - 4:27\n6. If Not for You - 3:33\n7. Behind That Locked Door - 3:10\n8. Let It Down - 5:01\n9. Run of the Mill - 2:53\n10. I Live for You - 3:35\n11. Beware of Darkness (acoustic demo) - 3:19\n12. Let It Down (alternate version) - 3:54\n13. What Is Life (backing track/alternate mix) - 4:27\n14. My Sweet Lord (2000) - 4:57\n\nDisc 2:\n1. Beware of Darkness - 3:51\n2. Apple Scruffs - 3:09\n3. Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll) - 3:53\n4. Awaiting on You All - 2:47\n5. All Things Must Pass - 2:47\n6. I Dig Love - 4:59\n7. Art of Dying - 3:42\n8. Isn't It a Pity (version two) - 4:50\n9. Hear Me Lord - 5:51\n11. It's Johnny's Birthday - 0:50\n12. Plug Me In - 3:20\n13. I Remember Jeep - 8:09\n13.

The album reflects the influence of his musical activities outside the Beatles during 1968–70 – with Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney & Bonnie, Billy Preston and others – and Harrison's growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The album introduced Harrison's signature sound, the slide guitar, and the spiritual themes that would be implicit throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams, titled Apple Jam. Commentators interpret Barry Feinstein's album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.\n\nProduction began at London's Abbey Road Studios in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unreleased.\n\nAll Things Must Pass was critically acclaimed on release and, with long stays at number 1 on charts around the world, commercially successful. The album was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs the latter's Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as \"Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Reflecting the general surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's post-Beatles debut, Melody Maker's Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo's first role in a talking picture and declared: \"Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!\" Several critics consider All Things Must Pass to be the best of all the Beatles' solo albums.\n\nIn March 2001, following a successful reissue campaign coinciding with its 30th anniversary, the album was certified 6x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2012, Rolling Stone placed All Things Must Pass 433rd on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\n\nCorrect track listing:\n\nA1. I'd Have You Anytime - 3:00\nA2. My Sweet Lord - 4:43\nA3. Wah-Wah - 5:38\nA4. Isn't It a Pity (version one) - 7:14\nB1. What Is Life - 4:27\nB2. If Not for You - 3:33\nB3. Behind That Locked Door - 3:10\nB4. Let It Down - 5:01\nB5. Run of the Mill - 2:53\nC1. Beware of Darkness - 3:51\nC2. Apple Scruffs - 3:09\nC3. Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll) - 3:53\nC4. Awaiting on You All - 2:47\nC5. All Things Must Pass - 2:47\nD1. I Dig Love - 4:59\nD2. Art of Dying - 3:42\nD3. Isn't It a Pity (version two) - 4:50\nD4. Hear Me Lord - 5:51\nE1. Out of the Blue - 11:17\nE2. It's Johnny's Birthday - 0:50\nE3. Plug Me In - 3:20\nF1. I Remember Jeep - 8:09\nF2. Thanks for the Pepperoni - 5:32\n\nThe remaster from 2001 moved \"Out of the Blue\" to the end of the album and inserted five bonus tracks after the first LP. The insertion of the bonus tracks into the middle of the album's running order was regarded as an unwelcome addition to the album, particularly since there was enough space to include the album's first two LPs on the first CD and the last LP with the bonus tracks on the second. The running order on this edition is as follows:\n\nDisc 1:\n1. I'd Have You Anytime - 3:00\n2. My Sweet Lord - 4:43\n3. Wah-Wah - 5:38\n4. Isn't It a Pity (version one) - 7:14\n5. What Is Life - 4:27\n6. If Not for You - 3:33\n7. Behind That Locked Door - 3:10\n8. Let It Down - 5:01\n9. Run of the Mill - 2:53\n10. I Live for You - 3:35\n11. Beware of Darkness (acoustic demo) - 3:19\n12. Let It Down (alternate version) - 3:54\n13. What Is Life (backing track/alternate mix) - 4:27\n14. My Sweet Lord (2000) - 4:57\n\nDisc 2:\n1. Beware of Darkness - 3:51\n2. Apple Scruffs - 3:09\n3. Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll) - 3:53\n4. Awaiting on You All - 2:47\n5. All Things Must Pass - 2:47\n6. I Dig Love - 4:59\n7.
