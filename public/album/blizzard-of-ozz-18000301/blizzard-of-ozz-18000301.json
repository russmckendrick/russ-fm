      "biography": "John Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English heavy metal vocalist and songwriter, whose musical career has spanned over 40 years. Osbourne rose to prominence as lead singer of the pioneering English band Black Sabbath, whose dark and hard sound helped spawn the heavy metal genre. Due to Sabbath's dark style, Osbourne became known as the \"Prince of Darkness\". Osbourne is also known as the \"Godfather of Heavy Metal\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne's career expanded when he became a star in his own reality show The Osbournes, alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. A documentary about his life and career, God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, premiered in April 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released on DVD in November 2011. Osbourne has achieved multi-platinum status as a solo artist and with Black Sabbath and has sold over 100 million albums worldwide.",

      "editorial_notes": "No one expected much from Ozzy Osbourne after he was booted from Black Sabbath in 1979. Holed up in an LA hotel, slowly drinking himself to death, he was widely regarded as washed up. Enter Sharon Arden, daughter of Don Arden, the mobster-manager who’d helped Sabbath secure fame and fortune. Convinced Ozzy was finished, Don Arden gifted the singer’s contract to his daughter—and soon, the future Sharon Osbourne swooped in to help Ozzy get his act together.\n\nSaid act was largely based around Quiet Riot guitarist Randy Rhoads, who was considered Eddie Van Halen’s only real competition in the shred-lord revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Rhoads was young, classically trained and ferociously talented—all qualities that made him <i>exactly</i> the kind of nitro-boost Ozzy needed to reignite his flagging career. Along with Aussie bassist and lyricist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake—both veterans of the UK hard-rock wizards Uriah Heep—Rhoads and Ozzy recorded one of the most important albums in heavy metal history: The 1980 classic <i>Blizzard of Ozz</i>.\n\nDecades since the album’s release, its raucous lead single “Crazy Train” is <i>still</i> Ozzy’s most recognisable solo track. Propelled by an unstoppable Rhoads riff—as well as by lyrics about the Cold War arms race that somehow doubled as a metaphor for Ozzy’s unpredictable personality—the song announced a bold new era for the singer. Its follow-up single, “Mr. Crowley”, only underscored Ozzy’s remarkable rebirth, even as his mispronunciation of infamous English occultist Aleister Crowley’s name became immortalised for the ages. The intro by Rainbow keyboardist Don Airey is straight out of a vintage Hammer horror flick, and the song’s doomy pace is reminiscent of Ozzy’s work with Black Sabbath—but what <i>really</i> sends the song into the stratosphere is Rhoads’ searing neo-classical solos.\n\nElsewhere on the album, “I Don’t Know” provides a sharp contrast to circa-1970s Sabbath: Alternately aggressive and melancholy, decorated with a dizzying Rhoads performance, it’s as much a declaration of agnosticism as it is a statement of musical intent. “Revelation (Mother Earth)”, meanwhile, is a pro-environment song written long before such topics were in vogue; its power comes in an instrumental maelstrom, led by Rhoads and Airey, in the song’s latter half. And the moralist anti-porn anthem “No Bone Movies” is a catchy boogie rock oddity that also discourages masturbation.\n\n“Goodbye to Romance” was reportedly the first song written for the album. A kiss-off to Ozzy’s glory days with Sabbath, the vocal melody recalls his beloved Beatles, as Rhoads plays a delicate baroque figure. It’s followed by “Dee”, Rhoads’ classical acoustic instrumental dedicated to—and named after—his mother. And the rip-roaring “Suicide Solution” became controversial five years later, when the parents of a suicidal teenager sued Ozzy and the record label, claiming their son killed himself immediately after listening to the song (Daisley, who wrote most of the lyrics, has said they’re actually about Ozzy drinking himself to death).\n\n<i>Blizzard of Ozz</i> became a lightning rod again in 2002, when Sharon Osbourne enlisted Ozzy’s then-current bassist Robert Trujillo (later of Metallica) and drummer Mike Bordin (Faith No More) to re-record Daisley and Kerslake’s parts for a reissue. After significant public backlash, the original bass and drum tracks were restored for a 2011 remaster. That release, along with later editions, also include the non-LP “Crazy Train” B-side “You Looking at Me, Looking at You”.",

            "content": "Blizzard of Ozz is a heavy metal album by Ozzy Osbourne, recorded in Surrey, U.K. and released on September 20, 1980 in the UK and on January 15, 1981 in the US.\n\nThis is Osbourne's first solo album and one of the two studio albums he recorded before guitarist Randy Rhoads' death in March 1982. The tracks \"Crazy Train\" and \"Mr. Crowley\" were released as singles. The former peaked at #9 on the Mainstream Rock Charts and has remained a staple of pop, hard-rock, and classic-rock radio for more than 25 years; it remains Ozzy's most recognizable song.\n\nBlizzard of Ozz remains Osbourne's highest-selling album to date, shifting over 4.1 million copies in the U.S. alone.\n\n\nReception\nThe album reached #21 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, and is on the list of the top 100 best-selling albums of the 1980s. It is notable for having achieved multi-platinum success even without the benefit of a Mainstream Top 40 single.\n\nUncut (8/02, p.112) - 3.5 out of 5 - \"Surprisingly melodic.\"\n\nKerrang! (p.53) - \" work of genius.... some superb songs, many of which are now regarded as timeless classics.\"\n\n\nControversy\nThe song \"Suicide Solution\" has been criticized for its lyrics that allegedly encouraged suicide, and was alleged to be a direct cause in the October 1984 suicide of John McCollum, a fourteen year-old fan who shot himself while listening to Osbourne's records. The boy's parents sued Osbourne and CBS Records for \"encouraging self-destructive behavior\" in young persons who were \"especially susceptible\" to dangerous influences (McCollum et al. v. CBS, Inc., et al.). In his defence, Osbourne said that the song was really about the untimely death of AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, who perished due to alcohol-related causes just months before Blizzard of Ozz was released. Bassist Bob Daisley, however, contradicts this, claiming that he wrote the song about Osbourne's own dangerous abuse of alcohol and drugs. The McCollums' complaint was dismissed on the grounds that the First Amendment protected Osbourne's right to free artistic expression.\n\nIn 1986, Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake sued Osbourne for unpaid royalties, eventually winning songwriting credits on Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. The 2002 reissues of these albums are derided by fans due to the substitution of the original bass and drum tracks of Daisley and Kerslake for new ones by Osbourne's then-current drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Robert Trujillo. Fans and critics generally felt the move was dishonest, especially as no indication of the changes appears on the exterior packaging or sleeves of the altered albums (although stickers indicating this were later added.) Osbourne's wife and manager, Sharon, explained the re-recordings in a press conference: \"Because of Daisley and Kerslake's abusive and unjust behaviour, Ozzy wanted to remove them from these recordings. We turned a negative into a positive by adding a fresh sound to the original albums.\" Daisley and Kerslake deny the allegations of \"abusive behaviour\" and continue to battle for royalties owed them for their work on Blizzard of Ozz.\n\nOn the 2002 re-release, on the non-label side of the cd there is a backwards phrase which can be read by reading from a mirror - 'lostprophetsstartsomething'.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Ozzy Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, and Bob Daisley except where noted.\n\n\nSide one\n\"I Don't Know\" – 5:16 \n\"Crazy Train\" – 4:56 \n\"Goodbye to Romance\" – 5:36 \n\"Dee\" (Instrumental) (Rhoads) – 0:50 \n\"Suicide Solution\" – 4:21 \n\nSide two\n\"Mr. Crowley\" – 4:55 \n\"No Bone Movies\" (Osbourne, Rhoads, Daisley, Lee Kerslake) – 3:53 \n\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\" – 6:09 \n\"Steal Away (The Night)\" – 3:28 \n\n2002 Bonus Track\n\"You Lookin' at Me Lookin' at You\" – 4:16 \n\nPersonnel\nOzzy Osbourne - Vocals, Harmony Vocals, Producer \nRandy Rhoads - Guitar, Producer \nBob Daisley - Bass, Gong, backing vocals, Harmony Vocals, Producer \nLee Kerslake - Drums, percussion, Bells, Tympani , Producer \n\n Additional personnel\nDon Airey - Keyboards \nRudy Sarzo - Bass \n\n Production\nMax Norman - Engineer \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ozzy+Osbourne/Blizzard+of+Ozz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

We turned a negative into a positive by adding a fresh sound to the original albums.\" Daisley and Kerslake deny the allegations of \"abusive behaviour\" and continue to battle for royalties owed them for their work on Blizzard of Ozz.\n\nOn the 2002 re-release, on the non-label side of the cd there is a backwards phrase which can be read by reading from a mirror - 'lostprophetsstartsomething'.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Ozzy Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, and Bob Daisley except where noted.\n\n\nSide one\n\"I Don't Know\" – 5:16 \n\"Crazy Train\" – 4:56 \n\"Goodbye to Romance\" – 5:36 \n\"Dee\" (Instrumental) (Rhoads) – 0:50 \n\"Suicide Solution\" – 4:21 \n\nSide two\n\"Mr. Crowley\" – 4:55 \n\"No Bone Movies\" (Osbourne, Rhoads, Daisley, Lee Kerslake) – 3:53 \n\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\" – 6:09 \n\"Steal Away (The Night)\" – 3:28 \n\n2002 Bonus Track\n\"You Lookin' at Me Lookin' at You\" – 4:16 \n\nPersonnel\nOzzy Osbourne - Vocals, Harmony Vocals, Producer \nRandy Rhoads - Guitar, Producer \nBob Daisley - Bass, Gong, backing vocals, Harmony Vocals, Producer \nLee Kerslake - Drums, percussion, Bells, Tympani , Producer \n\n Additional personnel\nDon Airey - Keyboards \nRudy Sarzo - Bass \n\n Production\nMax Norman - Engineer \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ozzy+Osbourne/Blizzard+of+Ozz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_summary": "Blizzard of Ozz is a heavy metal album by Ozzy Osbourne, recorded in Surrey, U.K. and released on September 20, 1980 in the UK and on January 15, 1981 in the US.

The former peaked at #9 on the Mainstream Rock Charts and has remained a staple of pop, hard-rock, and classic-rock radio for more than 25 years; it remains Ozzy's most recognizable song.
