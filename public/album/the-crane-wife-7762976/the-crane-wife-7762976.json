      "biography": "The Decemberists are an indie folk rock band from Portland, Oregon, United States, fronted by singer/songwriter Colin Meloy. The other members of the band are Chris Funk (guitar, multi-instrumentalist), Jenny Conlee (Hammond organ, accordion, melodica, piano, keyboards, harmonica), Nate Query (bass guitar, string bass), and John Moen (drums, backing vocals, melodica, guitar).\n\nIn addition to their lyrics, which often focus on historical incidents and/or folklore, The Decemberists are also well known for their eclectic live shows. Audience participation is often a part of each performance, typically during encores. The band stages whimsical reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd. During their European tour in the winter of 2010, the band performed \"The Mariner's Revenge Song\" at the conclusion of each date. The audience was encouraged to scream as if they were being consumed by a whale mentioned in the track's narrative while the band pretended to die on stage. In 2011, the track \"Down by the Water\" from the album The King is Dead was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards.\n\nThe group's songs range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads, and often employ instruments like the accordion, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer organ, and upright bass. In its lyrics, the band eschews the introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as \"My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist\" from the 5 Songs EP and \"The Mariner's Revenge Song\" on Picaresque. The band's songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (\"The Sporting Life\") to epic (\"The Tain\") to dark (\"Odalisque\", \"The Rake's Song\"), and often invoke historical events and themes from around the world (\"Yankee Bayonet\", \"The Bagman's Gambit\").\n\nOn their website, the group claim that their official drink is Orangina, that they love the video-game Bioshock and \"adore\" the bands Norfolk & Western, Explosions In The Sky, The Postal Service, The Long Winters, Death Cab for Cutie, Dokken, Ulrich Schnauss, El Ten Eleven, The Shins, The Octopus Project, Electrelane, Camera Obscura, Clearlake, The Thermals, Modest Mouse, Swords and Earlimart. The band's official biography, keeping up their reputation for grandiloquence, also describes how they met in a Turkish bath. A footnote following the biography claims, \"The Decemberists travel exclusively by Dr. Herring's Brand Dirigible Balloons.\" Colin Meloy has listed Anne Briggs, Nic Jones, and Shirley Collins – who led the 1960s British folk revival – as major influences on The Hazards of Love. Meloy has also confessed a \"slavish love\" for Morrissey, one of his principal influences. The band has also cited their liking for Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the pop tunes of R.E.M. and XTC. The band also draws inspiration from British and Irish folk music.",

But on <i>The Crane Wife</i>, the band toys with a different sort of nostalgia. A series of arena-style power chords ring out at the end of the sublime opener, \"The Crane Wife 3\", an oddly sequenced finale to a three-part song cycle for a Japanese folktale. Those chords presage the head-scratcher to come:  yet another themed song cycle,\"The Island,\" nearly thirteen minutes long and enthusiastically channeling the ghosts of early Yes, Pink Floyd, even (seriously) Jethro Tull. Studded with swirling organ fills and Meloy's impassioned yips, this is prog rock at its most earnest and grandiose, and the song grows on you - as does the album's other curiosity, the Steely Dan-style white-boy funk of \"The Perfect Crime\". Not every song is such a departure: witness the bubbly \"O Valencia\", or \"Yankee Bayonet\", a lovely, lovelorn duet with Laura Veirs. .  <i>The Crane Wife</i> shows a band in transition: dark, brooding, and ambitious.",

            "content": "The Crane Wife is an album by The Decemberists, released in 2006. It was produced by Tucker Martine and Chris Walla, and is the band's first album on the Capitol Records label. The album was inspired by a Japanese folk tale, and centers on two song cycles, The Crane Wife and The Island, the latter of which was inspired by William Shakespeare's The Tempest. National Public Radio listeners voted The Crane Wife the best album of 2006.\n\nThe album cover was made by Portland artist Carson Ellis, long-time girlfriend (and now wife) of Colin Meloy, who has created artwork for each of their albums.\n\nThe Crane Wife is an old Japanese tale. While there are many variations of the tale, a common version is that a poor man finds an injured crane on his doorstep (or outside with an arrow in it), takes it in and nurses it back to health. After he releases the crane, a woman appears at his doorstep with whom he falls in love and marries. Because they need money, his wife offers to weave wondrous clothes out of silk that they can sell at the market, but only if he agrees never to watch her making them. They begin to sell them and live a comfortable life, but he soon makes her weave them more and more. Oblivious to his wife's diminishing health, his greed increases. He eventually peeks in to see what she is doing to make the silk she weaves so desirable. He is shocked to discover that at the loom is a crane plucking feathers from her own body and weaving them into the loom. The crane, seeing him, flies away and never returns.\n\nBand leader Colin Meloy found a version of this story and decided to write music based on it.\n\nIn a January 2007 interview given on the NPR show Fresh Air, Colin Meloy gave this synopsis of the story:\n\n    \"It's a story about a peasant in rural Japan who finds a wounded crane on an evening walk; there's an arrow in its wing. He revives the crane and the crane flies away. A couple days later, a mysterious woman shows up at his door and he takes her in. Eventually they fall in love and get married. But they're very poor, so she suggests that she start weaving this cloth which he can in turn sell at the market—the condition being that when she's weaving it, she has to do it behind closed doors and he can't look in. So this goes on for a while and they actually become kind of wealthy. But eventually, his curiosity gets the best of him and he looks in at her while she's weaving and it turns out that she's a crane and she's been pulling feathers from her wings and putting it into the cloth, which is what makes it so beautiful. But him having seen her breaks the spell, and she turns back into a crane and flies away.
