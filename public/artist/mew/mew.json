  "biography": "Formed in 1994 in Hellerup, an upper-class suburb of Copenhagen, they had a profound impact on the Danish indie scene, emerging alongside the likes of Carpark North, Swan Lee and Saybia, amongst others, in 2003. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year\".\nTheir first major commercial success came with Frengers, released in 2003, described as \"a work of quiet brilliance, aiming for the epic without straying into the bombastic, offering cerebral arrangements while keeping things accessible.\" The album was well received. After a European tour supporting R.E.M. they began to attract wider attention. Their next album And the Glass Handed Kites was released in Denmark on 19 September 2005, in the United Kingdom and rest of Europe on 26 September, and in the United States on 25 July 2006. The album received critical acclaim, with Mew described as making \"dreamy thunderstorm pop\". They were MTV Asia \"Buzz-Worthy\" as of January, 2006, and at the DMA06 (Danish Music Awards) they took home 4 statuettes.\nOn 11 April 2006, Wohlert left the band to spend more time with his girlfriend, Pernille Rosendahl from the now dissolved band Swan Lee, who was to give birth to their baby boy in May 2006. The two would later go on to form a duo, The Storm.\nThe band tours with Nick Watts (formerly of UK indie band Headswim) as their keyboardist, and Bastian Juel (who used to act as a studio and live bassist for Swan Lee and also played bass on Tina Dico's EP Far) recently joined them as their live bassist. However, he is not an official replacement for Johan and the band has said they will return to the studio with just the three original members.\nThe band finished touring for And the Glass Handed Kites in the summer of 2007. They returned to Brooklyn, New York in May 2008 in order to begin recording their next record, and tapped Rich Costey (who produced their breakthrough album, Frengers) once again as producer.\nThe band's fifth album No More Stories / Are Told Today / I'm Sorry / They Washed Away // No More Stories / The World Is Grey / I'm Tired / Let's Wash Away was released on August 17, 2009 in Scandinavia, August 24 in the UK, and August 25 in the US.\nIn 2009, the band supported Nine Inch Nails for various tour dates across Europe and the United States.\nOn October 25, 2010, Mew released their first compilation album entitled, Eggs Are Funny, which featured 14 songs from previous albums as well as one new song, \"Do You Love It?\". The track list was compiled of what Mew consider to be their \"best work\".\nOn an episode of HBO's Eastbound and Down, airing 10/31/2010, \"Comforting Sounds\" from the album \"Frengers\" played over the end of the show and into the closing credits.\nOn February 9th, Mew hinted that they have begun writing new material in a Twitter post. They confirmed this in another Twitter post on February 29th.",

When on tour, Mew is supported by Dr. Nick Watts (Headswim) on keyboard, and Mads Wegner on guitar  (original guitarist Bo Madsen (guitar) left the band in 2015.) The band\\'s music can be described as experimental pop or as singer Jonas Bjerre mentioned in a recent interview: \"I think that we combine pop music with something that\\'s much more experimental, in our own way. I don\\'t think I would even try and describe it. It\\'s difficult.\" Guitarist Bo Madsen has also classified Mew\\'s music as \"indie stadium\".\\n\\nThe members of Mew started playing music together in 1995.  Mew first achieved success in Denmark with their album Frengers, although their debut album, A Triumph for Man, had been met with much critical acclaim back in 1997. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year.\" Until this point Mew was relatively unknown outside of Denmark; however after a European tour supporting R.E.M. Mew began to attract wider attention. After releasing the critically-acclaimed album And The Glass Handed Kites, featuring contributions from J Mascis from Dinosaur Jr, Mew has built on their success in Denmark as well as attracting attention from other countries in Europe and Asia. In the summer of 2006, they toured as the supporting act for Bloc Party in the U.S. as well as for Kasabian in the U.S. and Canada in the fall. After these tours, they returned to Denmark to work on new material.  \\n\\nOn March 14th, 2007, Mew embarked on their first ever headlining tour in America with Oh No! Oh My! as the supporting act. Their fifth studio album, No More Stories/Are Told Today/I\\'m Sorry/They Washed Away//No More Stories/The World Is Grey/I\\'m Tired/Let\\'s Wash Away, was released in August 25, 2009. They\\'ve also toured with Nine Inch Nails, Kings of Leon and Sigur Rós. In 2010, they released a greatest hits compilation called Eggs are Funny. They began performing new material in 2012 at Roskilde Festival, and released their sixth studio album, +- in 2015. Madsen left the band the same year, and the band began writing new material for their new album shortly after they concluded their tour. They released their seventh studio album, Visuals, after releasing a few singles in the months preceding its release. They embarked on tours for the album, as well as a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of their breakthrough album Frengers in 2018. \\n\\nDiscography:\\n    * A Triumph for Man (1997, re-released 2006)\\n    * Half the World Is Watching Me (2000, re-released Aug 2007)\\n    * Frengers (2003)\\n    * And the Glass Handed Kites (2005)\\n    * No More Stories...

At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year\".\nTheir first major commercial success came with Frengers, released in 2003, described as \"a work of quiet brilliance, aiming for the epic without straying into the bombastic, offering cerebral arrangements while keeping things accessible.\" The album was well received. After a European tour supporting R.E.M. they began to attract wider attention. Their next album And the Glass Handed Kites was released in Denmark on 19 September 2005, in the United Kingdom and rest of Europe on 26 September, and in the United States on 25 July 2006. The album received critical acclaim, with Mew described as making \"dreamy thunderstorm pop\". They were MTV Asia \"Buzz-Worthy\" as of January, 2006, and at the DMA06 (Danish Music Awards) they took home 4 statuettes.\nOn 11 April 2006, Wohlert left the band to spend more time with his girlfriend, Pernille Rosendahl from the now dissolved band Swan Lee, who was to give birth to their baby boy in May 2006. The two would later go on to form a duo, The Storm.\nThe band tours with Nick Watts (formerly of UK indie band Headswim) as their keyboardist, and Bastian Juel (who used to act as a studio and live bassist for Swan Lee and also played bass on Tina Dico's EP Far) recently joined them as their live bassist. However, he is not an official replacement for Johan and the band has said they will return to the studio with just the three original members.\nThe band finished touring for And the Glass Handed Kites in the summer of 2007. They returned to Brooklyn, New York in May 2008 in order to begin recording their next record, and tapped Rich Costey (who produced their breakthrough album, Frengers) once again as producer.\nThe band's fifth album No More Stories / Are Told Today / I'm Sorry / They Washed Away // No More Stories / The World Is Grey / I'm Tired / Let's Wash Away was released on August 17, 2009 in Scandinavia, August 24 in the UK, and August 25 in the US.\nIn 2009, the band supported Nine Inch Nails for various tour dates across Europe and the United States.\nOn October 25, 2010, Mew released their first compilation album entitled, Eggs Are Funny, which featured 14 songs from previous albums as well as one new song, \"Do You Love It?\". The track list was compiled of what Mew consider to be their \"best work\".\nOn an episode of HBO's Eastbound and Down, airing 10/31/2010, \"Comforting Sounds\" from the album \"Frengers\" played over the end of the show and into the closing credits.\nOn February 9th, Mew hinted that they have begun writing new material in a Twitter post. They confirmed this in another Twitter post on February 29th.",

      "biography_en": "Formed in 1994 in Hellerup, an upper-class suburb of Copenhagen, they had a profound impact on the Danish indie scene, emerging alongside the likes of Carpark North, Swan Lee and Saybia, amongst others, in 2003. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year\".\nTheir first major commercial success came with Frengers, released in 2003, described as \"a work of quiet brilliance, aiming for the epic without straying into the bombastic, offering cerebral arrangements while keeping things accessible.\" The album was well received. After a European tour supporting R.E.M. they began to attract wider attention. Their next album And the Glass Handed Kites was released in Denmark on 19 September 2005, in the United Kingdom and rest of Europe on 26 September, and in the United States on 25 July 2006. The album received critical acclaim, with Mew described as making \"dreamy thunderstorm pop\". They were MTV Asia \"Buzz-Worthy\" as of January, 2006, and at the DMA06 (Danish Music Awards) they took home 4 statuettes.\nOn 11 April 2006, Wohlert left the band to spend more time with his girlfriend, Pernille Rosendahl from the now dissolved band Swan Lee, who was to give birth to their baby boy in May 2006. The two would later go on to form a duo, The Storm.\nThe band tours with Nick Watts (formerly of UK indie band Headswim) as their keyboardist, and Bastian Juel (who used to act as a studio and live bassist for Swan Lee and also played bass on Tina Dico's EP Far) recently joined them as their live bassist. However, he is not an official replacement for Johan and the band has said they will return to the studio with just the three original members.\nThe band finished touring for And the Glass Handed Kites in the summer of 2007. They returned to Brooklyn, New York in May 2008 in order to begin recording their next record, and tapped Rich Costey (who produced their breakthrough album, Frengers) once again as producer.\nThe band's fifth album No More Stories / Are Told Today / I'm Sorry / They Washed Away // No More Stories / The World Is Grey / I'm Tired / Let's Wash Away was released on August 17, 2009 in Scandinavia, August 24 in the UK, and August 25 in the US.\nIn 2009, the band supported Nine Inch Nails for various tour dates across Europe and the United States.\nOn October 25, 2010, Mew released their first compilation album entitled, Eggs Are Funny, which featured 14 songs from previous albums as well as one new song, \"Do You Love It?\". The track list was compiled of what Mew consider to be their \"best work\".\nOn an episode of HBO's Eastbound and Down, airing 10/31/2010, \"Comforting Sounds\" from the album \"Frengers\" played over the end of the show and into the closing credits.\nOn February 9th, Mew hinted that they have begun writing new material in a Twitter post. They confirmed this in another Twitter post on February 29th.",
