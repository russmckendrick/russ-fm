He has been an editor, writer, and photographer for the magazine, and has also done work and been featured in magazines like Vibe magazine and The Source.\n\nBobbito is the author of Where’d You Get Those?: New York City’s Sneaker Culture 1960-1987. He has hosted a show on ESPN called It's The Shoes, where he interviewed celebrities about their sneaker collection. He was also featured centrally in the sneaker documentary [For Kicks].\n\nHe performed the announcer's voice in the video games NBA Street Vol. 2 and NBA Street V3.\n\nIn 2006, Madison Square Garden Network (MSG-TV) hired Bobbito to do the \"Hot Minute At The Half\" reports with celebrities in the crowd during Knicks home games. He became the first Latino broadcast member in the 60-year history of the franchise.\n\nIn 2007, Bobbito worked with Nike on limited edition Nike Air Force 1 and Air Force 25 models featuring a logo and colors/fabrics that he selected. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bobbito\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
