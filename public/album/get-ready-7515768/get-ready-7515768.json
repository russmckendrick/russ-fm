      "biography": "New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 by Bernard Sumner (vocals, guitars, synthesisers), Peter Hook (bass, synthesisers) and Stephen Morris (drums, electronic drums, synthesisers) - the remaining members of Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis - with the addition of Gillian Gilbert (keyboards, guitars, synthesisers). In 1993 the band broke-up amidst tension between bandmembers, but reformed in 1998. In 2001, Phil Cunningham (guitars, synthesisers) replaced Gilbert, who left the group due to family commitments. In 2007, Peter Hook left the band and the band broke-up again, with Sumner saying in 2009 that he no longer wishes to make music as New Order. The band reunited in 2011 without Hook, with Gilbert returning to the fold and Tom Chapman replacing Hook on bass. During the band's career and inbetween lengthy breaks, bandmembers have immersed themselves on number of solo projects, such as Sumner's Electronic and Bad Lieutenant; Hook's Monaco and Revenge and Gilbert's and Morris' The Other Two.\nBy combining New Wave and electronic music, New Order became one of the most critically acclaimed and highly influential bands of the 1980s. Though the band's early years were shadowed by the legacy and basic sound of Joy Division, their immersion in the early 1980s New York City club scene increased their knowledge of dance music and enabled them to incorporate elements of that style into their work. The band's 1983 hit \"Blue Monday\", the best-selling 12-inch single of all time, is one example of how the band transformed their sound.\nNew Order were the flagship band for Factory Records. Their minimalist album sleeves and \"non-image\" (the band rarely gave interviews and were known for performing short concert sets with no encores) reflected the label's aesthetic of doing whatever the relevant parties wanted to do, including an aversion to including singles as album tracks. The band has often been acclaimed by fans, critics and other musicians as a highly influential force in the alternative rock, dance and rave music scenes.",

      "editorial_notes": "As a new century was getting underway, New Order returned with its hardest-rocking album yet: 2001’s <i>Get Ready</i>. The shift in sound was largely due to the fact that Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris—traditionally the more electronic-leaning members—were absent from the studio, leaving the rock-centric bassist Peter Hook and guitarist-singer Bernard Sumner on their own. They’d get assistance from producer Steve Osborne, who’d helped Lush transcend their shoegaze style on 1996’s <i>Lovelife</i> before working with rockers like U2, Starsailor and Doves. Osborne was also an accomplished remixer, one who was comfortable at the exact intersection of rock and dance. As a result, <i>Get Ready</i> would fit in neatly with the emerging rock revival of the early 2000s, with the album‘s slashing, guitar-sharpened lead single “Crystal” arriving right around the time The Strokes released their debut album. Once again, New Order was in the middle of the zeitgeist.\n\nThis new approach wasn’t completely out of nowhere. The more muscular tone found on <i>Get Ready</i> was already evident when Osborne and the band recorded the song “Brutal”—an artefact of late-stage alternative music and late-90s electronica if there ever was one—for Danny Boyle’s 2000 film, <i>The Beach</i>. And the aggro spirit of <i>Get Ready</i> was amplified by cameos from the likes of Billy Corgan, the guitar god and alt-rock outcast who lent his voice for “Turn My Way”, and who toured with the band for several <i>Get Ready</i> dates (though he sometimes hid at the back of the stage, his iconic dome hidden by a large hat). Another boost came from Primal Scream guitarist Andrew Innes, who added wailing wah-wah to “Rock the Shack”, while his bandmate Bobby Gillespie added vocals. The resulting noise was unlike anything New Order had done before—or since.",
