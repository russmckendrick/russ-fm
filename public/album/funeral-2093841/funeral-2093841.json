      "biography": "Arcade Fire is an indie rock band based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It consists of the husband and wife duo of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, along with Will Butler, Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury, Jeremy Gara, and Sarah Neufeld. Win Butler attended McGill and Régine Chassagne attended Concordia University, where he pursued religious studies and she studied jazz. Arcade Fire came to prominence with the release of their debut album, Funeral, in 2004 to critical acclaim. The band plays guitar, drums, bass guitar, piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, keyboard, French horn, accordion, harp, mandolin, and hurdy-gurdy. Most of their instruments are taken on tour, and the multi-instrumentalist band members switch duties throughout shows.\n\nArcade Fire has won numerous awards, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year, and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album for their third studio album, The Suburbs, released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success. In earlier years they won the 2008 Meteor Music Award for Best International Album and the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year for their second studio album, Neon Bible. They also received nominations for the Best Alternative Music Album Grammy for all three of their studio albums. The band's work has also been twice named as a short list nominee for the Polaris Music Prize in 2007 for Neon Bible and in 2011 for The Suburbs, winning the award for The Suburbs.\n\nWin Butler and Josh Deu began performing in Boston as Arcade Fire before moving to Montreal in 2001, recording the \"2001 Demos\" prior to their arrival in the city. The earliest Montreal-based incarnation of Arcade Fire began performing in the summer/fall of 2001, almost entirely in lofts and art galleries. One of the earliest shows took place at a Christian music festival, Inside Out Soul Festival, and later at a Montreal battle of the bands (other early shows took place at Concordia University's Faculty of Fine Arts VAV Gallery; later the group played the 2001 Christmas party of that faculty's MFA programme). At that time, the band consisted of future husband and wife Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, singer, guitarist, collaborator and original band co-founder Josh Deu, bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot), and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001-2003).\n\nThe initial Montreal structure of the band began to dissolve in the summer of 2002, when they travelled to Butler's family ranch in Maine to record their self-titled EP. Tension between Butler and Broscoe led the latter to exit the band following the recording session. Richard Reed Parry, who had been enlisted to help the band record, began to collaborate with them during the sessions and would go on to join the band shortly afterwards. In the winter of 2003, the band celebrated the release of its EP with a show at Montreal's Casa del Popolo. Before a crowd packed beyond capacity, the band's set ended (in the middle of an encore) with an argument between Butler and Reed, who quit the band on-stage. Mills told gathered friends in the crowd immediately thereafter that he considered the band to have broken up, as such resigning from the band as well. Following the on-stage implosion, Win's brother William Butler (subject of the early Arcade Fire song \"William Pierce Butler\") and Tim Kingsbury were brought in to replace Reed and Mills so that the band could continue, and they set out to promote the self-titled EP. The eponymous release (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) was sold at early shows. After the band achieved fame, the EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release.\n\nThe promise shown by the new band in its early live shows allowed them to land a record contract with the independent record label, Merge Records, before the end of its first year together.\n\nWhen asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: \"It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.\"",

            "content": "Funeral is the debut full-length album by Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire, released on September 14, 2004 in North America by Merge Records and on February 28, 2005 in Europe by Rough Trade Records. It was given its title because several band members had recently lost members of their families: Régine Chassagne's grandmother died in June 2003, Win and William Butler's grandfather (swing musician Alvino Rey) in March 2004, and Richard Reed Parry's aunt in April 2004.\n\nPreliminary recordings for Funeral were made during the course of a week in August 2003 at the Hotel2Tango in Montreal, Quebec, and the recording was completed later that year.\n\nThe album produced 5 singles. The most successful, \"Rebellion (Lies)\", peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Alternative Music Album. It received wide critical acclaim and topped many year-end lists. It was ranked eighth in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums, and #2 on Pitchfork's 200 Top Albums of the 2000s\n\nInitial critical response to Funeral was very positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 90, based on 30 reviews. Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger gave the album a rating of four and a half stars out of five. He described it as \"brave, empowering, and dusted with something that many of the indie-rock genre's more contrived acts desperately lack: an element of real danger.\" Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A-, saying that Funeral was \"...too fond of drama, but aware of its small place in the big world, and usually beautiful.\" Pitchfork Media ranked the album #2 on their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s list, after Radiohead's Kid A.\n\nDrowned in Sound also highly praised Funeral. Reviewer Jesus Chigley called the album \"...empowering and hopeful and euphoric all at once\", saying that \"it says everything there is to say about mortality and it does it in 10 tracks.\" Stylus's Josh Drimmer gave Funeral an A, calling it \"celebratory, emotionally rich and life-affirming\" Dave Simpson of The Guardian called it \"one of the year's best already, by a mile.\" Zeth Lundy of PopMatters complimented Funeral on its eccentricity, calling it \"bizarre at turns and recognizable elsewhere, equally beautiful and harrowing, theatrical and sincere, defying categorization while attempting to create new genres.\n\nTracklist\n01 Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) 4:48\n02 Neighborhood #2 (Laïka) 3:32\n03 Une Année Sans Lumière 3:41\n04 Neighborhood #3 (Power Out) 5:12\n05 Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles) 4:49\n06 Crown Of Love 4:42\n07 Wake Up 5:35\n08 Haïti 4:07\n09 Rebellion (Lies) 5:12\n10 In The Backseat 6:20 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire/Funeral\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Funeral is the debut full-length album by Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire, released on September 14, 2004 in North America by Merge Records and on February 28, 2005 in Europe by Rough Trade Records. It was given its title because several band members had recently lost members of their families: Régine Chassagne's grandmother died in June 2003, Win and William Butler's grandfather (swing musician Alvino Rey) in March 2004, and Richard Reed Parry's aunt in April 2004.\n\nPreliminary recordings for Funeral were made during the course of a week in August 2003 at the Hotel2Tango in Montreal, Quebec, and the recording was completed later that year.\n\nThe album produced 5 singles. The most successful, \"Rebellion (Lies)\", peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Alternative Music Album. It received wide critical acclaim and topped many year-end lists. It was ranked eighth in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums, and #2 on Pitchfork's 200 Top Albums of the 2000s\n\nInitial critical response to Funeral was very positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 90, based on 30 reviews. Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger gave the album a rating of four and a half stars out of five. He described it as \"brave, empowering, and dusted with something that many of the indie-rock genre's more contrived acts desperately lack: an element of real danger.\" Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A-, saying that Funeral was \"...too fond of drama, but aware of its small place in the big world, and usually beautiful.\" Pitchfork Media ranked the album #2 on their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s list, after Radiohead's Kid A.\n\nDrowned in Sound also highly praised Funeral. Reviewer Jesus Chigley called the album \"...empowering and hopeful and euphoric all at once\", saying that \"it says everything there is to say about mortality and it does it in 10 tracks.\" Stylus's Josh Drimmer gave Funeral an A, calling it \"celebratory, emotionally rich and life-affirming\" Dave Simpson of The Guardian called it \"one of the year's best already, by a mile.\" Zeth Lundy of PopMatters complimented Funeral on its eccentricity, calling it \"bizarre at turns and recognizable elsewhere, equally beautiful and harrowing, theatrical and sincere, defying categorization while attempting to create new genres.\n\nTracklist\n01 Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) 4:48\n02 Neighborhood #2 (Laïka) 3:32\n03 Une Année Sans Lumière 3:41\n04 Neighborhood #3 (Power Out) 5:12\n05 Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles) 4:49\n06 Crown Of Love 4:42\n07 Wake Up 5:35\n08 Haïti 4:07\n09 Rebellion (Lies) 5:12\n10 In The Backseat 6:20 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire/Funeral\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
