      "biography": "Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and humanitarian. He is best known for his work with his E Street Band. Nicknamed \"The Boss,\" Springsteen is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, Americana, working class and sometimes political sentiments centered on his native New Jersey, his distinctive voice and his lengthy and energetic stage performances, with concerts from the 1970s to the present decade running over three hours in length.\nSpringsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the U.S.A. (1984), showcase a talent for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life; he has sold more than 64 million albums in the United States and more than 120 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award as well as being inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999.",

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> Bruce Springsteen’s third album is as close to a perfect record as he would ever make. His first two efforts had featured epic tales, populated with wild characters. But with <i>Born to Run</i>, released in 1975, he finally cracked the cypher on how to compress and tighten those long-form stories—making the songs easier for listeners to absorb, and for radio DJs to spin.\n\nSpringsteen envisioned <i>Born to Run</i> as a song cycle, one that starts at daybreak and ends at dawn, with the harmonica in “Thunder Road” acting as reveille, and with “Jungleland” at the end bringing the curtain down—in more ways than one. In between, there’s plenty of drama and noir, with Springsteen’s vivid characters getting into trouble down dark alleys, where they fight for freedom (or, at least, redemption). The mid-album highlight is the title track, which Springsteen would later pinpoint as the moment he learned to successfully combine power and emotion—lyrically <i>and</i> musically—in a shorter form, while still delivering the same impact his longer epics did. “Born to Run” became an anthem for FM rock radio, with stations in cities like Cleveland and New York playing it at 5 pm on Fridays to commemorate the start of the weekend.\n\n<i>Born To Run</i> also marks the first record in which Springsteen had more impact on the album’s overall sound. He sought help in its arrangement and production from his good friend Steven Van Zandt, as well as the music writer Jon Landau (who’d later become Springsteen’s manager). Together, they fashioned a record that sounded like a grittier, more fantastical version of Phil Spector’s infamous Wall of Sound. Perhaps most importantly, though, <i>Born to Run</i> was the album that solidified the lineup of the E Street Band: Pianist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg had recently joined the group, giving Springsteen a backing team that not only had solid musical chops, but also an energy that matched the challenge in front of them. <i>Born to Run</i> manages to feel exhilarating, heartbreaking, thoughtful and tragic—the truly defining moment for Springsteen as a performer and as a songwriter.",

            "content": "Born to Run is the third album by the American rock singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen. It was released on August 25, 1975 through Columbia Records. It captured the heaviness of Springsteen's earlier releases while displaying a more diverse range of influences.\n\nBorn to Run was a critical and commercial success and became Springsteen's breakthrough album. It peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and reached high positions on charts worldwide. Two singles were released from the album: \"Born to Run\" and \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\", the first helped Springsteen to reach mainstream popularity. The tracks \"Thunder Road\" and \"Jungleland\" became staples of album-oriented rock radio and Springsteen concert high points. The album has been placed on several \"best ever\" lists and is listed in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of historic recordings.\n\nOn November 14, 2005, a \"30th Anniversary\" remaster of the album was released as a box set including two DVDs: a production diary film and a concert movie. Being ranked number 18 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it is probably his magnum opus, although Born in the U.S.A. also received as much critical acclaim and as much success.\n\nSpringsteen began work on the album after touring in support of its previous album, The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, released in 1973. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a wall of sound production. But, fed by the release of an early mix of \"Born to Run\" to progressive rock radio, anticipation built toward the album's release. All in all the album took more than 14 months to record, with six months alone spent on the song \"Born To Run\" itself. During this time Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard \"sounds in  head\" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. During the process, Springsteen brought in Jon Landau to help with production. This was the beginning of the breakup of Springsteen's relationship with producer and manager Mike Appel, after which Landau assumed both roles.\n\nOnce released, Born to Run was a breakthrough hit and catapulted his career from a northeast regional act to an acclaimed national and worldwide recording artist. This was his first album to feature pianist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg. Born to Run was released to overwhelming critical acclaim which swiftly spiralled into hype. While his previous two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, received good reviews, popular success had been scarce; Born to Run cemented Springsteen's reputation among critics and established his first mainstream fanbase.\n\nThe album is noted for its use of introductions to set the tone of each song (all of the record was composed on piano, not guitar), and for the Phil Spector-like \"Wall of Sound\" arrangements and production. Indeed, Springsteen has said that he wanted \"Born to Run\" to sound like \"Roy Orbison singing Bob Dylan, produced by Spector.\" Most of the tracks were first recorded with a core rhythm section band comprising Springsteen, Weinberg, Bittan, and bassist Garry Tallent, with other members' contributions then added on.\n\nIn terms of the original LP's sequencing, Springsteen eventually adopted a \"four corners\" approach, as the songs beginning each side (\"Thunder Road\", \"Born to Run\") were uplifting odes to escape, while the songs ending each side (\"Backstreets\", \"Jungleland\") were sad epics of loss, betrayal, and defeat (Originally, he had planned to begin and end the album with alternative versions of \"Thunder Road\".)\n\nAlso, original pressings have \"Meeting Across the River\" billed as \"The Heist\". The original album cover has the title printed in a graffiti style font. These copies are very rare and considered to be the \"holy grail\" for Springsteen collectors.\n\nThe album's release was accompanied by a $250,000 promotional campaign by Columbia directed at both consumers and the music industry, making good use of Landau's \"I saw rock 'n' roll's future—and its name is Bruce Springsteen\" quote. With much publicity, Born to Run vaulted into the top 10 in its second week on the charts and soon went Gold. Time and Newsweek magazines put Springsteen on the cover in the same week (October 27, 1975) – in Time, Jay Cocks praised Springsteen, while the Newsweek article took a cynical look at the \"next Dylan\" hype that haunted Springsteen until his breakthrough. The question of hype became a story in itself as critics began wondering if Springsteen was for real or the product of record company promotion.\n\nUpset with Columbia's promotion department, Springsteen said the decision to label him as the \"future of rock was a very big mistake and I would like to strangle the guy who thought that up.\" When Springsteen arrived for his first UK concert at the Hammersmith Odeon, he personally tore down the \"Finally the world is ready for Bruce Springsteen\" posters in the lobby and ordered that the buttons with \"I have seen the future of rock 'n' roll at the Hammersmith Odeon\" printed on them not be given out. Now fearing the hype might backfire, Columbia suspended all press interviews with Springsteen. When the hype died down, sales tapered off and the album was off the chart after 29 weeks. But the album had established a solid national fan base for Springsteen which he would build on with each subsequent release.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard Album Charts on September 13 1975 at #84. The following made an impressive increase entering the Top 10 at #8, then spent two weeks at #4, and finally, during the weeks of October 11 and October 18, Born to Run reached his peak position of #3. Those two weeks, the #1 album was John Denver's Windsong and the #2 was Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.\n\nBorn to Run continued to be a strong catalog seller through the years, re-entering the Billboard chart in late 1980 after The River was released, and again after the blockbuster success of Born in the U.S.A., spending most of 1985 on the chart. It was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1986, the first year in which pre-1976 releases were eligible for platinum and multi-platinum awards.\n\nIn 1987, Born to Run was ranked #8 on Rolling Stone's \"100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years\" and in 2003, Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" ranked Born to Run at number 18. In 2001, the TV network VH1 named it the 27th-greatest album of all time, and in 2003, it was ranked as the most popular album in the first Zagat Survey Music Guide.\n\nBorn to Run is listed in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of historic recordings.\n\nIn December 2005, U.S. Representative Frank Pallone (who represents Asbury Park) and 21 co-sponsors sponsored H.Res. 628, \"Congratulating Bruce Springsteen of New Jersey on the 30th anniversary of his masterpiece record album 'Born to Run', and commending him on a career that has touched the lives of millions of Americans.\" In general, resolutions honoring native sons are passed with a simple voice vote. This bill, however, was referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and died there. \n\nIn August 2009 it was announced Springsteen and the E Street Band would perform Born to Run in its entirety and in order during the fall concert tour. As a result, the concert date in Nashville, Tennessee was postponed from September until November.\n\nThe cover art of Born to Run is one of rock music's most popular and iconic images. It was taken by Eric Meola, who shot 900 frames in his three-hour session. These photos have been compiled in Born to Run: The Unseen Photos.\n\nThe photo shows Springsteen holding an electric guitar, a cross between a Fender Telecaster (body and pickups) and a Fender Esquire (neck), while leaning against saxophonist Clarence Clemons. After he plugged in an amp and started to play, he casually leaned on Clemons. That image became famous as the cover art. \"Other things happened,\" says Meola, \"but when we saw the contact sheets, that one just sort of popped. Instantly, we knew that was the shot.\" Ultra-thin lettering graced the mass-produced version: an unusual touch then; a design classic since.\n\nThe Springsteen and Clemons cover pose has been imitated often, from Cheap Trick on the album Next Position Please, to Tom and Ray Magliozzi on the cover of the Car Talk compilation Born Not to Run: More Disrespectful Car Songs, to Kevin & Kell on a Sunday strip entitled \"Born to Migrate\" featuring Kevin Dewclaw as Bruce with a carrot and Kell Dewclaw as Clarence with a pile of bones, to Bert and the Cookie Monster on the cover of the Sesame Street album Born to Add. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/Born+to+Run\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

That image became famous as the cover art. \"Other things happened,\" says Meola, \"but when we saw the contact sheets, that one just sort of popped. Instantly, we knew that was the shot.\" Ultra-thin lettering graced the mass-produced version: an unusual touch then; a design classic since.\n\nThe Springsteen and Clemons cover pose has been imitated often, from Cheap Trick on the album Next Position Please, to Tom and Ray Magliozzi on the cover of the Car Talk compilation Born Not to Run: More Disrespectful Car Songs, to Kevin & Kell on a Sunday strip entitled \"Born to Migrate\" featuring Kevin Dewclaw as Bruce with a carrot and Kell Dewclaw as Clarence with a pile of bones, to Bert and the Cookie Monster on the cover of the Sesame Street album Born to Add. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/Born+to+Run\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
