  "biography": "There are two artists with this name:\n\n1) Northside are a band from the suburbs of Blackley and Moston in North Manchester, England. Founded in 1989 by Warren \"Dermo\" Dermody (vocals/lyrics) and Cliff Ogier (bass), the band released their debut and only album, \"Chicken Rhythms,\" on Factory Records in 1991. Northside was part of the 1990s Madchester/baggy/rave scene. Michael Upton (guitar) and Paul Walsh (drums) later joined the band, replacing Timmy Walsh, who played guitar in their first single, \"Shall We Take A Trip.\" The single was banned by the BBC for its references to drugs, but it broke into the UK Singles Chart Top 50 despite the lack of airplay.\n\nNorthside's next single, \"My Rising Star,\" was released in October 1990 and reached No. 32 on the chart. \"Chicken Rhythms\" peaked at No. 19 in June 1991, produced by Ian Broudie. In 1991, the band scored a minor hit in the United States when their single \"Take 5\" reached No. 5 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The band split up after their label Factory Records declared bankruptcy in 1992, despite having recorded a second album.\n\nIn 2003, Dermo and Ogier formed Silent Partners, while Walsh played with Manchester rock band Sons of the Stage.

      "bio_content": "There are two artists with this name:\n\n1) Northside are a band from the suburbs of Blackley and Moston in North Manchester, England. Founded in 1989 by Warren \"Dermo\" Dermody (vocals/lyrics) and Cliff Ogier (bass), the band released their debut and only album, \"Chicken Rhythms,\" on Factory Records in 1991. Northside was part of the 1990s Madchester/baggy/rave scene. Michael Upton (guitar) and Paul Walsh (drums) later joined the band, replacing Timmy Walsh, who played guitar in their first single, \"Shall We Take A Trip.\" The single was banned by the BBC for its references to drugs, but it broke into the UK Singles Chart Top 50 despite the lack of airplay.\n\nNorthside's next single, \"My Rising Star,\" was released in October 1990 and reached No. 32 on the chart. \"Chicken Rhythms\" peaked at No. 19 in June 1991, produced by Ian Broudie. In 1991, the band scored a minor hit in the United States when their single \"Take 5\" reached No. 5 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The band split up after their label Factory Records declared bankruptcy in 1992, despite having recorded a second album.\n\nIn 2003, Dermo and Ogier formed Silent Partners, while Walsh played with Manchester rock band Sons of the Stage. In 2006, Northside played gigs in Leeds and Manchester, and the album \"Chicken Rhythms\" was re-issued on LTM Recordings. Dermo formed V Thirteen in March 2011. In 2014, Northside reunited with all four original members and toured England. In 2017, Dermo released his debut single \"Vultures\" on Eromeda Records and recorded his debut solo album set for a 2018 release.\n\n2) Northside, a trap artist from Costa Rica. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Northside\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
