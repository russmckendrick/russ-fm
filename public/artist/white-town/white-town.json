  "biography": "White Town is a British musical act and is the work of one man, Jyoti Prakash Mishra. White Town is best known for his song \"Your Woman\", which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in January 1997. \"Your Woman\" also peaked at number one in Spain, as well as number two in Australia, number four in Canada, Denmark and Finland and number 23 in the United States. \n\nEarly life:\nMishra was born in Rourkela, India on 30 July 1966, but emigrated to the United Kingdom with his family at age three. \n\nMusical career:\nWhite Town was formed by Mishra in 1989 after he saw The Pixies play. Initially there were other members on guitar, bass and drums playing support gigs for various bands including Primal Scream. In 1990 he released his first self-financed record, White Town EP, on 7\" vinyl. This featured Nick Glyn-Davis on drums and Sean Deegan on bass with Mishra on guitar and vocals. Glyn-Davis left and was replaced live by a drum machine and Leon Wilson on guitar. The rest of the band drifted away in Autumn 1990 and from then on Mishra mainly worked on his own, using other musicians to record with, including Gary Thatcher of the Derby band The Beekeepers on guitar. \nAfter a troubled working relationship with EMI, Mishra was dropped from the label in 1997. Since then, he has gone back to working with indie labels such as Parasol Records. His album, 2000's Peek & Poke, received moderately enthusiastic reviews but sold poorly compared to his major label work. \nIn 2005, White Town contributed the song \"The PNAC Cabal\" to the charity album, Voyces United for UNHCR. \nA New Surprise EP was released in September 2006 by the Swedish indie label Heavenly Pop Hits, and was followed up by the album Don't Mention the War, which launched Mishra's own Bzangy Records label.",

White Town is best known for his song \"Your Woman\", which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in January 1997. \"Your Woman\" also peaked at number one in Spain, as well as number two in Australia, number four in Canada, Denmark and Finland and number 23 in the United States. \n\nEarly life:\nMishra was born in Rourkela, India on 30 July 1966, but emigrated to the United Kingdom with his family at age three. \n\nMusical career:\nWhite Town was formed by Mishra in 1989 after he saw The Pixies play. Initially there were other members on guitar, bass and drums playing support gigs for various bands including Primal Scream. In 1990 he released his first self-financed record, White Town EP, on 7\" vinyl. This featured Nick Glyn-Davis on drums and Sean Deegan on bass with Mishra on guitar and vocals. Glyn-Davis left and was replaced live by a drum machine and Leon Wilson on guitar. The rest of the band drifted away in Autumn 1990 and from then on Mishra mainly worked on his own, using other musicians to record with, including Gary Thatcher of the Derby band The Beekeepers on guitar. \nAfter a troubled working relationship with EMI, Mishra was dropped from the label in 1997. Since then, he has gone back to working with indie labels such as Parasol Records. His album, 2000's Peek & Poke, received moderately enthusiastic reviews but sold poorly compared to his major label work. \nIn 2005, White Town contributed the song \"The PNAC Cabal\" to the charity album, Voyces United for UNHCR. \nA New Surprise EP was released in September 2006 by the Swedish indie label Heavenly Pop Hits, and was followed up by the album Don't Mention the War, which launched Mishra's own Bzangy Records label.",

This single was often known not by its name, but by the title of the EP it originally appeared on - \">Abort, Retry, Fail?_\".\n\nMishra, a straight edger and ex-Marxist, often incorporates political concerns in his songs veiled in terms of personal relationships (as in his only hit). After a troubled working relationship with EMI Records, Mishra was dropped from the label in 1997 and since then has gone back to working with indie labels like Parasol Records. His last album, 2000's Peek & Poke, received moderately enthusiastic reviews but sold pitifully compared to his major label work.\n\nIn 2005 White Town contributed the song \"The PNAC Cabal\" to the charity album \"Voyces United for UNHCR\" (Voyces United for UNHCR (disc 1)).\n\nIn October 2006 White Town released a new album, Don't Mention The War on Mishra's own label, Bzangy Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/White+Town\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

White Town is best known for his song \"Your Woman\", which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in January 1997. \"Your Woman\" also peaked at number one in Spain, as well as number two in Australia, number four in Canada, Denmark and Finland and number 23 in the United States. \n\nEarly life:\nMishra was born in Rourkela, India on 30 July 1966, but emigrated to the United Kingdom with his family at age three. \n\nMusical career:\nWhite Town was formed by Mishra in 1989 after he saw The Pixies play. Initially there were other members on guitar, bass and drums playing support gigs for various bands including Primal Scream. In 1990 he released his first self-financed record, White Town EP, on 7\" vinyl. This featured Nick Glyn-Davis on drums and Sean Deegan on bass with Mishra on guitar and vocals. Glyn-Davis left and was replaced live by a drum machine and Leon Wilson on guitar. The rest of the band drifted away in Autumn 1990 and from then on Mishra mainly worked on his own, using other musicians to record with, including Gary Thatcher of the Derby band The Beekeepers on guitar. \nAfter a troubled working relationship with EMI, Mishra was dropped from the label in 1997. Since then, he has gone back to working with indie labels such as Parasol Records. His album, 2000's Peek & Poke, received moderately enthusiastic reviews but sold poorly compared to his major label work. \nIn 2005, White Town contributed the song \"The PNAC Cabal\" to the charity album, Voyces United for UNHCR. \nA New Surprise EP was released in September 2006 by the Swedish indie label Heavenly Pop Hits, and was followed up by the album Don't Mention the War, which launched Mishra's own Bzangy Records label.",
