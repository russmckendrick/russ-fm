      "biography": "The Beach Boys is an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The original lineup included brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Known for their vocal harmonies and lyrics often centered on youth culture, the band drew influence from older pop vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and rhythm and blues. Under Brian Wilson's leadership, their music sometimes incorporated elements of classical and jazz, as well as experimental recording techniques.\n\nInitially managed by the Wilsons' father, Murry Wilson, the group gained national recognition in 1963 with the release of \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" The song marked the beginning of a series of top-ten singles associated with the \"California sound,\" a style reflecting themes of surfing, cars, and romance. The Beach Boys were among the few American bands to maintain commercial success during the British Invasion. Beginning with the 1965 album \"The Beach Boys Today!\", the band shifted focus from surf-themed content to more introspective lyrics and complex arrangements. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" and the single \"Good Vibrations\" were significant in establishing the group's reputation for musical innovation. Plans for a follow-up album, \"Smile,\" were abandoned in 1967, after which Brian Wilson reduced his involvement in the band.\n\nThe band's popularity in the United States declined in the late 1960s, and their work was often overlooked by contemporary music critics at the time. In the early 1970s, the group underwent a change in public perception and musical direction, with Carl Wilson assuming a leadership role. During the mid-1970s, the group increasingly focused on live performances and retrospective compilations. Dennis Wilson died in 1983, and Brian Wilson later distanced himself from the band. Following Carl Wilson's death from lung cancer in 1998, Mike Love obtained legal rights to tour under the group's name. In the early 2010s, the surviving original members briefly reunited for a 50th anniversary tour. As of the 2020s, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine do not perform with the touring version of the Beach Boys led by Mike Love, though they are still officially considered members.\n\nThe Beach Boys have sold over 100 million records globally. Their work has had an influence on a variety of musical genres, including psychedelia, power pop, progressive rock, punk, alternative, and lo-fi. From the 1960s through the 2020s, the group achieved 37 Top 40 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, including four number-one hits. In 2004, they were ranked number 12 on Rolling Stone's list of the greatest artists of all time. Albums such as \"The Beach Boys Today!\", \"Pet Sounds,\" \"Smiley Smile,\" \"Sunflower,\" and \"Surf's Up\" have been frequently cited in critics' polls. The original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Additional members over the years have included David Marks, Bruce Johnston, Blondie Chaplin, and Ricky Fataar.\n\nOn June 11th 2025, Brian Wilson died at the age of 82.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys\n\nStudio albums\nSurfin' Safari (1962)\nSurfin' U.S.A.

The colours are brighter, the scale bigger. There are moments of wonder and excitement (“Wouldn’t It Be Nice”) and moments of profound pain (“I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times”). Brian Wilson’s arrangements brought a complexity to rock music that nobody had heard before, but they also captured a simple, poetic point: When you’re young, everything hits with the weight of an orchestra.\n\nWilson was a child of Southern California and Disney, of the great suburban myths that shaped America after World War II: The joke is that his brother Dennis was the only Beach Boy who actually surfed, while the rest just held boards to sell a story. At a mid-’60s moment when bands like The Velvet Underground were starting to use pop to explore rough, bracing realities, <i>Pet Sounds</i> reached back to the fantasies of ’30s pop and ’50s exotica, of old Hollywood and early television. And as sacred as the album’s mood is (Wilson called his next project, <i>Smile</i>, a “teenage symphony to God”), it makes sense that its co-lyricist, Tony Asher, had come from advertising: No matter how ambitious he got, he also knew he needed to project something neat, immediate and universal.\n\nOf all <i>Pet Sounds</i>’ legacies, the most profound is the idea that pop music—something accessible and extroverted—could be used to express deep, internal worlds. Wilson’s experiments with LSD aren’t obvious in any garish, cartoonish way. But you can hear him trying to excavate feelings buried so deep in the underbrush of shame and memory that seeking them out is an adventure on par with any. <i>Pet Sounds</i> is a reminder that the core of courage is innocence, and that just because you can’t change the past doesn’t mean it doesn’t still hurt.",

            "content": "Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on May 16, 1966. It initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 in the Billboard 200, a significantly lower placement than the band's preceding albums. In the United Kingdom, the album was hailed by its music press and was an immediate commercial success, peaking at number 2 in the UK Top 40 Albums Chart and remaining among the top ten positions for six months. Pet Sounds has subsequently gathered worldwide acclaim from critics and musicians alike, and is widely considered to be one of the most influential albums in music history.\n\nThe album was produced and arranged by Brian Wilson, who also wrote and composed almost all of its music. Most of the recording sessions were conducted between January and April 1966, a year after he had quit touring with the Beach Boys in order to focus more attention on writing and recording. For Pet Sounds, Wilson's goal was to create \"the greatest rock album ever made\" — a personalised work with no filler tracks. It is sometimes considered a Wilson solo album, repeating the themes and ideas he had introduced with The Beach Boys Today! one year earlier. The album's lead single, \"Caroline, No\", was issued as his official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (backed with \"God Only Knows\") and \"Sloop John B\".\n\nCollaborating with lyricist Tony Asher, Wilson's symphonic arrangements wove elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, coupled with sound effects and unusual instruments such as bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, Electro-Theremin, trains, Hawaiian-sounding string instruments, Coca-Cola cans, and barking dogs, along with the more usual keyboards and guitars. Unified by Wall of Sound-style production techniques, the album comprised Wilson's \"pet sounds\", consisting mainly of introspective songs like \"You Still Believe in Me\", about faithfulness, \"I Know There's an Answer\", a critique of LSD users, and \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", an autobiographical statement on social alienation (as well as the first use of a theremin-like instrument on a rock record). Recording was completed on April 13, 1966, with an unprecedented total production cost that exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $520,000 in 2016). A follow-up album, Smile, was immediately planned, but left unfinished. In 1997, a \"making-of\" version of Pet Sounds was supervised by Wilson and released as The Pet Sounds Sessions, containing the album's first true stereo mix.\n\nPet Sounds is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the field of music production, introducing non-standard harmonies and timbres, and incorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, and the avant-garde. A heralding work of psychedelia, the album furthered an aesthetic trend within rock by helping it transform from dance music into music that was made for listening to, elevating itself to the level of art rock. Author Bill Martin said that Pet Sounds represents a turning point where the Beach Boys \"brought expansions in harmony, instrumentation (and therefore timbre), duration, rhythm, and the use of recording technology. Of these elements, the first and last were the most important in clearing a pathway toward the development of progressive rock.\" In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" One year earlier, Rolling Stone ranked it second on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". As of 2015, Acclaimed Music lists Pet Sounds as the statistically most acclaimed album of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on May 16, 1966. It initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 in the Billboard 200, a significantly lower placement than the band's preceding albums. In the United Kingdom, the album was hailed by its music press and was an immediate commercial success, peaking at number 2 in the UK Top 40 Albums Chart and remaining among the top ten positions for six months. Pet Sounds has subsequently gathered worldwide acclaim from critics and musicians alike, and is widely considered to be one of the most influential albums in music history.\n\nThe album was produced and arranged by Brian Wilson, who also wrote and composed almost all of its music. Most of the recording sessions were conducted between January and April 1966, a year after he had quit touring with the Beach Boys in order to focus more attention on writing and recording. For Pet Sounds, Wilson's goal was to create \"the greatest rock album ever made\" — a personalised work with no filler tracks. It is sometimes considered a Wilson solo album, repeating the themes and ideas he had introduced with The Beach Boys Today! one year earlier. The album's lead single, \"Caroline, No\", was issued as his official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (backed with \"God Only Knows\") and \"Sloop John B\".\n\nCollaborating with lyricist Tony Asher, Wilson's symphonic arrangements wove elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, coupled with sound effects and unusual instruments such as bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, Electro-Theremin, trains, Hawaiian-sounding string instruments, Coca-Cola cans, and barking dogs, along with the more usual keyboards and guitars. Unified by Wall of Sound-style production techniques, the album comprised Wilson's \"pet sounds\", consisting mainly of introspective songs like \"You Still Believe in Me\", about faithfulness, \"I Know There's an Answer\", a critique of LSD users, and \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", an autobiographical statement on social alienation (as well as the first use of a theremin-like instrument on a rock record). Recording was completed on April 13, 1966, with an unprecedented total production cost that exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $520,000 in 2016). A follow-up album, Smile, was immediately planned, but left unfinished. In 1997, a \"making-of\" version of Pet Sounds was supervised by Wilson and released as The Pet Sounds Sessions, containing the album's first true stereo mix.\n\nPet Sounds is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the field of music production, introducing non-standard harmonies and timbres, and incorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, and the avant-garde. A heralding work of psychedelia, the album furthered an aesthetic trend within rock by helping it transform from dance music into music that was made for listening to, elevating itself to the level of art rock. Author Bill Martin said that Pet Sounds represents a turning point where the Beach Boys \"brought expansions in harmony, instrumentation (and therefore timbre), duration, rhythm, and the use of recording technology. Of these elements, the first and last were the most important in clearing a pathway toward the development of progressive rock.\" In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" One year earlier, Rolling Stone ranked it second on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". As of 2015, Acclaimed Music lists Pet Sounds as the statistically most acclaimed album of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
