  "biography": "Crazy, psycho-happy Cork punk band, singing and screaming about shopping, sheepdogs, toilet bowls, turnip-fish, and Japanese girls.  Listen and laugh a lot.\n\nTheir 1992 album Casual Sex in the Cineplex contained much of their best material, including Stupid Kid, You Talk Too Much and the perennial student-night favourite Where's Me Jumper?, but many amazing b-sides were great too: Turnip Fish, Armitage Shanks & Riot at the sheepdog trials\n\nThe live performance was the stuff of legend: usually playing to small, packed venues, the Sultans' frontman Niall O'Flaherty would unleash the anarchic Sultans of Ping sound whilst strutting, leaping and diving around and sometimes off the stage. The very literal \"dance routine\" which accompanied Wake Up And Scratch Me managed to keep the crowd entertained if a little unnerved by the blood loss.\n\nTheir name was later changed to simply \"Sultans of Ping\" for the second album Teenage Drug.\n\nFor the third album, Good Year For Trouble they became The Sultans. \n\nThey disbanded in 1996 but then started playing again in 2005. The current line-up includes Niall O'Flaherty, Morty McCarthy, Pat O'Connell, Sam Steiger (ex Golden Horde) and Ian Olney (ex Power of Dreams)\nThey released a single in 2007 called Girlwatching.\nThey continue to play to packed out audiences. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sultans+Of+Ping+F.C.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
