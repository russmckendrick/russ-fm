      "biography": "Amy Lee Grant (born November 25, 1960 in Augusta, GA) is an American Christian and pop singer-songwriter and has done some television. She has also sold 30 million albums world wide during her career.\n\nGrant made her debut in 1977 under the guidance of Myrrh Records, and became the first Christian recording act to have an album be certified platinum. Following her marriage to Gary Chapman in 1982 and a subsequent deal between her record company and A&M Records, a series of successful pop-crossover records consolidated her position as both Christian music's highest-selling act and a formidable force in mainstream music, and according to Billboard magazine she was the most successful Christian recording artist of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAfter giving birth to her fourth child Corinna Grant Gill, Grant returned to her gospel music roots with the 2002 release of Legacy...Hymns & Faith. The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix of bluegrass and gospel and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry. Grant followed this up with the pop release Simple Things in 2003. The album did not see the success of her previous pop efforts, and soon after the album, Amy and Interscope/A&M parted ways.\n\nGrant released a sequel to her hymns collection in 2005 titled Rock of Ages... Hymns & Faith. Despite publicly musing that life would be easier if she weren't working, Grant joined the reality television phenomenon by hosting Three Wishes, a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents. The show debuted on NBC in the fall of 2005, but was cancelled in November after 10 episodes.  After Three Wishes was cancelled, Grant won her 6th Grammy Award for Rock of Ages.\n\nTo date Amy Grant has sold more than 25 million records worldwide and is a 6 time Grammy winning artist. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Grant\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
