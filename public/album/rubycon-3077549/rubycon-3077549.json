      "biography": "Tangerine Dream is a German electronic music group founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese. The band has undergone many personnel changes over the years, with Froese being the only continuous member. Drummer and composer Klaus Schulze was briefly a member of an early lineup, but the most stable version of the group, during their influential mid-1970s period, was as a keyboard trio with Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. Early in the 1980s, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann, and this lineup, too, was stable and extremely productive.\nTangerine Dream's early \"Pink Years\" albums had a pivotal role in the development of Krautrock. Their \"Virgin Years\" and later albums became a defining influence in the genre known as New Age music, although the band themselves disliked the term.\nAlthough the group has released numerous studio and live recordings, a substantial number of their fans were introduced to Tangerine Dream by their film soundtracks, which total over sixty and include Sorcerer, Thief, The Keep, Risky Business, Firestarter, Legend, Near Dark, Shy People, and Miracle Mile.",

            "content": "1. Rubycon, Part One  17:18 \n2. Rubycon, Part Two  17:35 \nTotal running time 34:53 \n  \nThe title Rubycon relates to a story about Julius Caesar crossing the river Rubycon in 49 BC. He did it for \"all or nothing\", running into an unstoppable war. Hence the phrase \"crossing the Rubycon\" points out that a unreversable decision is made -- a point of no return. \n    \nTangerine Dream entered the Manor Studio again in 1975 to record an album on which they developed a new kind of electronic rhythm. Rubycon featured much the same instrumentation as Phaedra. It also showed a certain distance to mainstream rock, in that it was a suite in two parts, taking up two entire sides of the album -- as did Mike Oldfield's mid-'70s albums Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge and Ommadawn which were released by Virgin as well. \n\nDetails:     \nRecording date January 1975 \nRecording site(s) The Manor (Shipton-on-Cherwell) \nRecording engineer(s) Mike Glossop \nComposer(s) Edgar Froese, Chris Franke, Peter Baumann \nMusician(s) Edgar Froese, Chris Franke, Peter Baumann \nProducer(s) Edgar Froese, Chris Franke, Peter Baumann \n\nIn 1995 Virgin re-released the album on CD in the so-called \"Definitive Edition\" series, featuring the original front cover artwork.
