  "biography": "(NOTE: Album covers and artist images are not available due to certain legal restrictions imposed on last.fm by Wendy Carlos.)\n\nWendy Carlos (born November 14, 1939, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island) is a composer and electronic musician. Carlos trained as a composer and worked as a recording engineer before her 1968 Switched-On Bach became the first classical music album to be certified platinum. This, and subsequent albums, brought the Moog synthesizer to wider public attention, and her 1971 soundtrack to A Clockwork Orange introduced the vocoder. Other notable work includes soundtracks for The Shining and Tron. (Her first six albums were originally released under the name Walter Carlos.)\n\nIn 1992, Carlos released Switched-On Bach 2000 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her first album, featuring a re-recording of the album using digital synthesizers and computer-assisted recording with an added introductory composition (Happy 25th, S-OB) styled as a birthday fanfare for the project.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wendy+Carlos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
