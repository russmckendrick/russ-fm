  "biography": "Rodrigo y Gabriela (Rodrigo and Gabriela), also known as \"Rod y Gab\", are a Mexican musical duo who specialize in playing fast, rhythmic acoustic guitars. The duo's members are Rodrigo SÃ¡nchez, lead guitar, and Gabriela Quintero, rhythm guitar.\nThe musicians gained a reputation by playing in the pubs and bars of Dublin, Ireland, and despite their unusual style, gained a cult following. Reviewing one of their gigs, The Independent notes that \"Rodrigo y Gabriela's secret is maybe quite simple. They are resourceful musicians, and are open-hearted, happy entertainers. That, very often, is what people want.\" Both live a vegan lifestyle and support animal rights. They regularly dismiss being classified in a particular genre of music, preferring to say they play a fusion of many influences.",

The duo's members are Rodrigo Sanchez, lead guitar, and Gabriela Quintero, rhythm guitar.\r\n\r\nThe duo met in Mexico City while playing in a thrash metal band called \"Tierra Ãcida\". Growing frustrated with the limited scope of the domestic music scene, they moved to Europe, where they met considerable acclaim.\r\n\r\nThey took up residence in Dublin, Ireland, after hearing it was particularly welcoming to travelling musicians. Playing live gigs in various pubs and busking on Grafton Street and Temple Bar allowed them to practice their sound. They received their break when Damien Rice approached them to provide the support for the Irish music festival Oxegen. In 2005 they toured extensively in festivals around the United Kingdom and beyond.",

The duo's members are Rodrigo Sanchez, lead guitar, and Gabriela Quintero, rhythm guitar.\r\n\r\nThe duo met in Mexico City while playing in a thrash metal band called \"Tierra Ãcida\". Growing frustrated with the limited scope of the domestic music scene, they moved to Europe, where they met considerable acclaim.\r\n\r\nThey took up residence in Dublin, Ireland, after hearing it was particularly welcoming to travelling musicians. Playing live gigs in various pubs and busking on Grafton Street and Temple Bar allowed them to practice their sound. They received their break when Damien Rice approached them to provide the support for the Irish music festival Oxegen. In 2005 they toured extensively in festivals around the United Kingdom and beyond.",

Their music is difficult to define, straddling both world and rock and often imbued with timeless Hispano â classical influences. The fire in their music comes from their life-long passion for metal music. In spring 2006, âRodrigo y Gabriela,â beat both the Arctic Monkeys AND Johnny Cash to number one in the Irish charts. Both the artists and their third selfâtitled album have gone on to enjoy international success since its initial release in early 2006.\\n \\nRodrigo is a deft finger-picker who can move from raging speed to sensual soul in the space of a fret, while Gabriela employs fast, rhythmic techniques. Her percussionistâs thrashing of strings and drumming of the instrumentâs body inevitably raises comparisons with the flamenco style of rumba, but the band specifically denies a flamenco influence. Nonetheless, it is often referred to as \"nuevo flamenco\", symbolising a sort of renaissance of the traditionally Spanish music genre whose origins began in the Middle East when the Moors brought their cultural music to Europe. The duoâs repertoire flies beyond familiar Latin folk guitaristsâ styles because of the metal connection: their reworkings of Led Zeppelin\\'s âStairway to Heavenâ and Metallicaâs âOrionâ are musts, and the presence on âIxtapaâ of the fiery Hungarian gypsy violinist Roby Lakatos is inspirational.\\n\\nThe Story:\\nRodrigo and Gabriela met as teenagers, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture), in Mexico City, where Rodrigoâs brother was Director. Rodrigo was playing drums in his band Castlow - a code word he never revealed to Gabriela, and changed to Tierra Acida (Acid Earth) when she joined them on guitar. The couple drifted together through music; teenaged metal fanatics who both failed entrance to the Conservatory and moved into rock. Before joining Tierra Acida, Gabriela ran three girlsâ bands, Las Brujas (The Witches), Subterraneo and Las Formigas (The Ants) at once: Terra Acida had a disciplined work ethic: âIt was mental!â she recalls, âwe rehearsed five hours a day, every day, with very short breaks, and not much talking!â \\n\\nTierra Acida played in Mexico Cityâs roughest clubs and lived off day-jobs (Gabriela taught Metallica riffs to local kids; Rodrigo at a TV station, doing music for programmes). They recorded an album but wouldnât sign the record contract, planning instead to concentrate on learning more guitar styles. In fact, they just hung out with friends and survived by playing bossa novas in the hotel bars. âThen we decided to travel to Europeâ.\\n\\nTheir first port of call was Dublin, Ireland. âIt was the most unknown place to usâ, explains Gabriela, the talkative one. âAlso, a Mexican girl offered us her house there.â They landed in Dublin at night, spoke no English, and had $1,000 between them. They found a note on the door saying actually, sorry, but they couldnât stay there after all, so the taxi driver drove them round hostels and hotels all night. Eventually they rented a place - and soon the money disappeared: âSo - we had to buskâ. That was 1999: âWe were very exotic specimens!â They built a reputation and landed gigs in peopleâs homes, at wedding parties and gallery openings, playing covers and their own compositions, âWe still wanted to be metal composers, but everything came out as Latin!â \\n\\nDublin was booming then, with new music venues and galleries and a thriving rock scene, and the two Mexicans jammed with local folk musicians in the bars. In winter, they moved to Denmark and started again - this time busking at minus three degrees! The brief Copenhagen experience inspired two numbers on the current album, âDiablo Rojoâ, a scary roller-coaster ride in the city, and âViking Manâ, their nickname for a homeless man they befriended, who pushed them into busking on the freezing streets. \\n\\nNext, they hit Barcelona, but this time, the club owners assumed they played Mariachi, and wouldnât let them play in their own unique style, so Rod & Gab ended up jamming on Barcaâs main drag Las Ramblas getting heavy duty hassle from the Catalan cops. Just in time, a call came from Ireland to come back and play the newly opened Sugar Club. Damian Rice, then a busking friend, invited them to support his shows, and in 2003, they released âRe-Focâ, and a year later, âLive Manchester and Dublin,â which both launched them onto the World Music circuit â and beyond. \\n \\nThe Music:\\nRodrigo and Gabriela describe their style as âFusion musicâ: âItâs mainly got Latin harmonies and rhythms but the structure is rock. Itâs not jazz because itâs structured, and we donât improvise; our solos are exactly whatâs on the record, as a metal fan and guitarist you always want to hear the same f**king solo!â\\n\\nInfluences range from family salsa records to Gabrielaâs auntâs Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Queen, and Led Zeppelin vinyl, with Rodrigo also embracing a similar classic rock lineage. But crucially they grew up during Mexicoâs âmetal era.â âPeople expected two acoustic guitarists would play classical music, but we dropped in extracts from Led Zep, Hendrix and Metallica, then we did the same with âStairway to Heaven!â Their music is instrumental âwith very lyrical themes.â\\n\\nMentions of flamenco influences raise sharp responses: âTo many music fans, it sounds like flamenco, and weâre great flamenco fans, but we donât play itâ says Gabriela. âThe only similarity is that our music is guitar music and itâs very rhythmic.â\\n\\nThis albumâs producer John Leckie (Radiohead, Muse, My Morning Jacket) arrived on the scene via a demo sent to him by their Irish record label, and he called the very next day. The three agreed to record âliveâ, and Rodrigo and Gabriela were placed in the same room in a studio in Bath, England, to perform as if on stage: âWe played each track over and over, and only âOrionâ has overdubs.â Roby Lakatos, the fiery gypsy violinist was the only outsider, and his presence on âIxtapaâ is wonderful. âWe saw him on TVâ, Gabriela remembers, âPlaying at a concert in Amsterdam, and we sent him our music. He improvised this whole piece in two hours!â From the many, many live versions, Leckie chose âthe one.â \\n\\nThe Touring\\nThe global success of âRodrigo y Gabrielaâ (300,000 worldwide sales and counting) has been spurred on by Rod & Gabâs dedication to hard work on the road. 2006 saw three UK tours and three US tours, plus extensive European and Australian sojourns. 2007 has seen them back in the USA (once Rodrigoâs visa problems were sorted out by the State Department) and the UK for many more shows, including festival spots at Coachella, Glastonbury, V, Bonnaroo, Oxegen (Ireland), Latitude, Pukkelpop (Belgium), Lowlands (The Netherlands) and countless others. For Rodrigo y Gabriela, the road really does go on forever.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rodrigo+y+Gabriela\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their music is difficult to define, straddling both world and rock and often imbued with timeless Hispano â classical influences. The fire in their music comes from their life-long passion for metal music. In spring 2006, âRodrigo y Gabriela,â beat both the Arctic Monkeys AND Johnny Cash to number one in the Irish charts. Both the artists and their third selfâtitled album have gone on to enjoy international success since its initial release in early 2006.\\n \\nRodrigo is a deft finger-picker who can move from raging speed to sensual soul in the space of a fret, while Gabriela employs fast, rhythmic techniques. Her percussionistâs thrashing of strings and drumming of the instrumentâs body inevitably raises comparisons with the flamenco style of rumba, but the band specifically denies a flamenco influence. Nonetheless, it is often referred to as \"nuevo flamenco\", symbolising a sort of renaissance of the traditionally Spanish music genre whose origins began in the Middle East when the Moors brought their cultural music to Europe. The duoâs repertoire flies beyond familiar Latin folk guitaristsâ styles because of the metal connection: their reworkings of Led Zeppelin\\'s âStairway to Heavenâ and Metallicaâs âOrionâ are musts, and the presence on âIxtapaâ of the fiery Hungarian gypsy violinist Roby Lakatos is inspirational.\\n\\nThe Story:\\nRodrigo and Gabriela met as teenagers, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture), in Mexico City, where Rodrigoâs brother was Director. Rodrigo was playing drums in his band Castlow - a code word he never revealed to Gabriela, and changed to Tierra Acida (Acid Earth) when she joined them on guitar. The couple drifted together through music; teenaged metal fanatics who both failed entrance to the Conservatory and moved into rock. Before joining Tierra Acida, Gabriela ran three girlsâ bands, Las Brujas (The Witches), Subterraneo and Las Formigas (The Ants) at once: Terra Acida had a disciplined work ethic: âIt was mental!â she recalls, âwe rehearsed five hours a day, every day, with very short breaks, and not much talking!â \\n\\nTierra Acida played in Mexico Cityâs roughest clubs and lived off day-jobs (Gabriela taught Metallica riffs to local kids; Rodrigo at a TV station, doing music for programmes). They recorded an album but wouldnât sign the record contract, planning instead to concentrate on learning more guitar styles. In fact, they just hung out with friends and survived by playing bossa novas in the hotel bars. âThen we decided to travel to Europeâ.\\n\\nTheir first port of call was Dublin, Ireland. âIt was the most unknown place to usâ, explains Gabriela, the talkative one. âAlso, a Mexican girl offered us her house there.â They landed in Dublin at night, spoke no English, and had $1,000 between them. They found a note on the door saying actually, sorry, but they couldnât stay there after all, so the taxi driver drove them round hostels and hotels all night. Eventually they rented a place - and soon the money disappeared: âSo - we had to buskâ. That was 1999: âWe were very exotic specimens!â They built a reputation and landed gigs in peopleâs homes, at wedding parties and gallery openings, playing covers and their own compositions, âWe still wanted to be metal composers, but everything came out as Latin!â \\n\\nDublin was booming then, with new music venues and galleries and a thriving rock scene, and the two Mexicans jammed with local folk musicians in the bars. In winter, they moved to Denmark and started again - this time busking at minus three degrees! The brief Copenhagen experience inspired two numbers on the current album, âDiablo Rojoâ, a scary roller-coaster ride in the city, and âViking Manâ, their nickname for a homeless man they befriended, who pushed them into busking on the freezing streets. \\n\\nNext, they hit Barcelona, but this time, the club owners assumed they played Mariachi, and wouldnât let them play in their own unique style, so Rod & Gab ended up jamming on Barcaâs main drag Las Ramblas getting heavy duty hassle from the Catalan cops. Just in time, a call came from Ireland to come back and play the newly opened Sugar Club. Damian Rice, then a busking friend, invited them to support his shows, and in 2003, they released âRe-Focâ, and a year later, âLive Manchester and Dublin,â which both launched them onto the World Music circuit â and beyond. \\n \\nThe Music:\\nRodrigo and Gabriela describe their style as âFusion musicâ: âItâs mainly got Latin harmonies and rhythms but the structure is rock. Itâs not jazz because itâs structured, and we donât improvise; our solos are exactly whatâs on the record, as a metal fan and guitarist you always want to hear the same f**king solo!â\\n\\nInfluences range from family salsa records to Gabrielaâs auntâs Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Queen, and Led Zeppelin vinyl, with Rodrigo also embracing a similar classic rock lineage. But crucially they grew up during Mexicoâs âmetal era.â âPeople expected two acoustic guitarists would play classical music, but we dropped in extracts from Led Zep, Hendrix and Metallica, then we did the same with âStairway to Heaven!â Their music is instrumental âwith very lyrical themes.â\\n\\nMentions of flamenco influences raise sharp responses: âTo many music fans, it sounds like flamenco, and weâre great flamenco fans, but we donât play itâ says Gabriela. âThe only similarity is that our music is guitar music and itâs very rhythmic.â\\n\\nThis albumâs producer John Leckie (Radiohead, Muse, My Morning Jacket) arrived on the scene via a demo sent to him by their Irish record label, and he called the very next day. The three agreed to record âliveâ, and Rodrigo and Gabriela were placed in the same room in a studio in Bath, England, to perform as if on stage: âWe played each track over and over, and only âOrionâ has overdubs.â Roby Lakatos, the fiery gypsy violinist was the only outsider, and his presence on âIxtapaâ is wonderful. âWe saw him on TVâ, Gabriela remembers, âPlaying at a concert in Amsterdam, and we sent him our music. He improvised this whole piece in two hours!â From the many, many live versions, Leckie chose âthe one.â \\n\\nThe Touring\\nThe global success of âRodrigo y Gabrielaâ (300,000 worldwide sales and counting) has been spurred on by Rod & Gabâs dedication to hard work on the road. 2006 saw three UK tours and three US tours, plus extensive European and Australian sojourns. 2007 has seen them back in the USA (once Rodrigoâs visa problems were sorted out by the State Department) and the UK for many more shows, including festival spots at Coachella, Glastonbury, V, Bonnaroo, Oxegen (Ireland), Latitude, Pukkelpop (Belgium), Lowlands (The Netherlands) and countless others. For Rodrigo y Gabriela, the road really does go on forever.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rodrigo+y+Gabriela\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ihr Album Rodrigo y Gabriela erzielte auf Anhieb als erstes Instrumentalalbum Ã¼berhaupt Platz 1 der Charts in ihrer Wahlheimat Irland. Ihre akustischen Gitarren setzen sie auch perkussiv virtuos ein. \n\nRodrigo SÃ¡nchez und Gabriela Quintero spielten frÃ¼her gemeinsam in der Thrash-Metal-Band Tierra Acida. Ohne groÃe Erfolge erzielen zu kÃ¶nnen, zogen sie nach Irland, in der Hoffnung auf bessere Chancen fÃ¼r Nachwuchsmusiker. Hier spielten sie lÃ¤ngere Zeit in Pubs und entwickelten dabei ihren Stil.\n\n2002 verÃ¶ffentlichten sie in eigener Produktion ihr erstes Album Re-Foc und 2004 Live Manchester and Dublin. 2005 schlieÃlich kam der Durchbruch, als sie von Damien Rice entdeckt wurden und seine Tour als Vorband begleiteten. Ihr drittes Album Rodrigo y Gabriela wurde von John Leckie produziert, der zuvor schon mit Gruppen wie Radiohead oder Muse als Produzent Erfolge verzeichnen konnte. Das Album schaffte es auf Anhieb auf Platz eins der irischen Charts. Nach der VerÃ¶ffentlichung in Irland erfolgte am 13. MÃ¤rz 2006 die internationale VerÃ¶ffentlichung des Albums.\n\nInternationale Aufmerksamkeit erlangten sie nicht zuletzt durch ihre aufwÃ¤ndigen Coverversionen der Hits Stairway to Heaven von Led Zeppelin und Orion von Metallica.\n\n2011 wirkten sie gemeinsam mit Hans Zimmer am Soundtrack von Pirates of the Caribbean â Fremde Gezeiten mit. Am 20. Januar 2011 begannen sie mit dem Schreiben und Aufnehmen der Musik. Der Soundtrack ist am 20.

The duo's members are Rodrigo SÃ¡nchez, lead guitar, and Gabriela Quintero, rhythm guitar.\nThe musicians gained a reputation by playing in the pubs and bars of Dublin, Ireland, and despite their unusual style, gained a cult following.

That, very often, is what people want.\" Both live a vegan lifestyle and support animal rights. They regularly dismiss being classified in a particular genre of music, preferring to say they play a fusion of many influences.",

      "bio_content": "Rodrigo Sanchez and Gabriela Quintero are two fast-fingered Mexicans with a unique sound created on acoustic guitars. Their music is difficult to define, straddling both world and rock and often imbued with timeless Hispano â classical influences. The fire in their music comes from their life-long passion for metal music. In spring 2006, âRodrigo y Gabriela,â beat both the Arctic Monkeys AND Johnny Cash to number one in the Irish charts. Both the artists and their third selfâtitled album have gone on to enjoy international success since its initial release in early 2006.\n \nRodrigo is a deft finger-picker who can move from raging speed to sensual soul in the space of a fret, while Gabriela employs fast, rhythmic techniques. Her percussionistâs thrashing of strings and drumming of the instrumentâs body inevitably raises comparisons with the flamenco style of rumba, but the band specifically denies a flamenco influence. Nonetheless, it is often referred to as \"nuevo flamenco\", symbolising a sort of renaissance of the traditionally Spanish music genre whose origins began in the Middle East when the Moors brought their cultural music to Europe. The duoâs repertoire flies beyond familiar Latin folk guitaristsâ styles because of the metal connection: their reworkings of Led Zeppelin's âStairway to Heavenâ and Metallicaâs âOrionâ are musts, and the presence on âIxtapaâ of the fiery Hungarian gypsy violinist Roby Lakatos is inspirational.\n\nThe Story:\nRodrigo and Gabriela met as teenagers, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture), in Mexico City, where Rodrigoâs brother was Director. Rodrigo was playing drums in his band Castlow - a code word he never revealed to Gabriela, and changed to Tierra Acida (Acid Earth) when she joined them on guitar. The couple drifted together through music; teenaged metal fanatics who both failed entrance to the Conservatory and moved into rock. Before joining Tierra Acida, Gabriela ran three girlsâ bands, Las Brujas (The Witches), Subterraneo and Las Formigas (The Ants) at once: Terra Acida had a disciplined work ethic: âIt was mental!â she recalls, âwe rehearsed five hours a day, every day, with very short breaks, and not much talking!â \n\nTierra Acida played in Mexico Cityâs roughest clubs and lived off day-jobs (Gabriela taught Metallica riffs to local kids; Rodrigo at a TV station, doing music for programmes). They recorded an album but wouldnât sign the record contract, planning instead to concentrate on learning more guitar styles. In fact, they just hung out with friends and survived by playing bossa novas in the hotel bars. âThen we decided to travel to Europeâ.\n\nTheir first port of call was Dublin, Ireland. âIt was the most unknown place to usâ, explains Gabriela, the talkative one. âAlso, a Mexican girl offered us her house there.â They landed in Dublin at night, spoke no English, and had $1,000 between them. They found a note on the door saying actually, sorry, but they couldnât stay there after all, so the taxi driver drove them round hostels and hotels all night. Eventually they rented a place - and soon the money disappeared: âSo - we had to buskâ. That was 1999: âWe were very exotic specimens!â They built a reputation and landed gigs in peopleâs homes, at wedding parties and gallery openings, playing covers and their own compositions, âWe still wanted to be metal composers, but everything came out as Latin!â \n\nDublin was booming then, with new music venues and galleries and a thriving rock scene, and the two Mexicans jammed with local folk musicians in the bars. In winter, they moved to Denmark and started again - this time busking at minus three degrees! The brief Copenhagen experience inspired two numbers on the current album, âDiablo Rojoâ, a scary roller-coaster ride in the city, and âViking Manâ, their nickname for a homeless man they befriended, who pushed them into busking on the freezing streets. \n\nNext, they hit Barcelona, but this time, the club owners assumed they played Mariachi, and wouldnât let them play in their own unique style, so Rod & Gab ended up jamming on Barcaâs main drag Las Ramblas getting heavy duty hassle from the Catalan cops. Just in time, a call came from Ireland to come back and play the newly opened Sugar Club. Damian Rice, then a busking friend, invited them to support his shows, and in 2003, they released âRe-Focâ, and a year later, âLive Manchester and Dublin,â which both launched them onto the World Music circuit â and beyond. \n \nThe Music:\nRodrigo and Gabriela describe their style as âFusion musicâ: âItâs mainly got Latin harmonies and rhythms but the structure is rock. Itâs not jazz because itâs structured, and we donât improvise; our solos are exactly whatâs on the record, as a metal fan and guitarist you always want to hear the same f**king solo!â\n\nInfluences range from family salsa records to Gabrielaâs auntâs Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Queen, and Led Zeppelin vinyl, with Rodrigo also embracing a similar classic rock lineage. But crucially they grew up during Mexicoâs âmetal era.â âPeople expected two acoustic guitarists would play classical music, but we dropped in extracts from Led Zep, Hendrix and Metallica, then we did the same with âStairway to Heaven!â Their music is instrumental âwith very lyrical themes.â\n\nMentions of flamenco influences raise sharp responses: âTo many music fans, it sounds like flamenco, and weâre great flamenco fans, but we donât play itâ says Gabriela. âThe only similarity is that our music is guitar music and itâs very rhythmic.â\n\nThis albumâs producer John Leckie (Radiohead, Muse, My Morning Jacket) arrived on the scene via a demo sent to him by their Irish record label, and he called the very next day. The three agreed to record âliveâ, and Rodrigo and Gabriela were placed in the same room in a studio in Bath, England, to perform as if on stage: âWe played each track over and over, and only âOrionâ has overdubs.â Roby Lakatos, the fiery gypsy violinist was the only outsider, and his presence on âIxtapaâ is wonderful. âWe saw him on TVâ, Gabriela remembers, âPlaying at a concert in Amsterdam, and we sent him our music. He improvised this whole piece in two hours!â From the many, many live versions, Leckie chose âthe one.â \n\nThe Touring\nThe global success of âRodrigo y Gabrielaâ (300,000 worldwide sales and counting) has been spurred on by Rod & Gabâs dedication to hard work on the road. 2006 saw three UK tours and three US tours, plus extensive European and Australian sojourns. 2007 has seen them back in the USA (once Rodrigoâs visa problems were sorted out by the State Department) and the UK for many more shows, including festival spots at Coachella, Glastonbury, V, Bonnaroo, Oxegen (Ireland), Latitude, Pukkelpop (Belgium), Lowlands (The Netherlands) and countless others. For Rodrigo y Gabriela, the road really does go on forever.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rodrigo+y+Gabriela\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_de": "Rodrigo y Gabriela ist ein mexikanisches Gitarrenduo. Ihr Album Rodrigo y Gabriela erzielte auf Anhieb als erstes Instrumentalalbum Ã¼berhaupt Platz 1 der Charts in ihrer Wahlheimat Irland. Ihre akustischen Gitarren setzen sie auch perkussiv virtuos ein. \n\nRodrigo SÃ¡nchez und Gabriela Quintero spielten frÃ¼her gemeinsam in der Thrash-Metal-Band Tierra Acida. Ohne groÃe Erfolge erzielen zu kÃ¶nnen, zogen sie nach Irland, in der Hoffnung auf bessere Chancen fÃ¼r Nachwuchsmusiker. Hier spielten sie lÃ¤ngere Zeit in Pubs und entwickelten dabei ihren Stil.\n\n2002 verÃ¶ffentlichten sie in eigener Produktion ihr erstes Album Re-Foc und 2004 Live Manchester and Dublin. 2005 schlieÃlich kam der Durchbruch, als sie von Damien Rice entdeckt wurden und seine Tour als Vorband begleiteten. Ihr drittes Album Rodrigo y Gabriela wurde von John Leckie produziert, der zuvor schon mit Gruppen wie Radiohead oder Muse als Produzent Erfolge verzeichnen konnte. Das Album schaffte es auf Anhieb auf Platz eins der irischen Charts. Nach der VerÃ¶ffentlichung in Irland erfolgte am 13. MÃ¤rz 2006 die internationale VerÃ¶ffentlichung des Albums.\n\nInternationale Aufmerksamkeit erlangten sie nicht zuletzt durch ihre aufwÃ¤ndigen Coverversionen der Hits Stairway to Heaven von Led Zeppelin und Orion von Metallica.\n\n2011 wirkten sie gemeinsam mit Hans Zimmer am Soundtrack von Pirates of the Caribbean â Fremde Gezeiten mit. Am 20. Januar 2011 begannen sie mit dem Schreiben und Aufnehmen der Musik. Der Soundtrack ist am 20. Mai 2011 im deutschen Sprachraum erschienen.\n\nFÃ¼r das Album Mettavolution bekamen sie 2020 einen Grammy in der Kategorie Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. \n(Wikipedia)",
      "biography_en": "Rodrigo y Gabriela (Rodrigo and Gabriela), also known as \"Rod y Gab\", are a Mexican musical duo who specialize in playing fast, rhythmic acoustic guitars. The duo's members are Rodrigo SÃ¡nchez, lead guitar, and Gabriela Quintero, rhythm guitar.\nThe musicians gained a reputation by playing in the pubs and bars of Dublin, Ireland, and despite their unusual style, gained a cult following. Reviewing one of their gigs, The Independent notes that \"Rodrigo y Gabriela's secret is maybe quite simple. They are resourceful musicians, and are open-hearted, happy entertainers. That, very often, is what people want.\" Both live a vegan lifestyle and support animal rights. They regularly dismiss being classified in a particular genre of music, preferring to say they play a fusion of many influences.",
