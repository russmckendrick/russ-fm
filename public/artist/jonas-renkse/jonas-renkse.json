  "biography": "Jonas Petter Renkse (May 19, 1975 - ) is a founding member and the lead singer of the band Katatonia. In addition, he played the drums for the band from its founding in 1991 through the band's 1998 album Discouraged Ones. Early in his career with the band, he used the names Lord Seth and Lord J. Renkse.\n\nRenkse was also a member of the band October Tide, releasing albums in 1997 and 1999, and is also currently the bassist for Bloodbath. He has recently contributed vocals to the latest Ayreon album along with a number of other guest singers. His contribution is notable as it includes not only his clean singing style, as featured on recent Katatonia albums, but also some death metal vocals in the style he used previously. It is thought to be the first time he has sung in this way on a recording for a number of years.\n\nRenkse's lyrics often deal with very dark subject matter often relating to isolation and a general incompatibilty with society and human conventions. His lyrics are often very profound and are a huge focal point of Katatonia's music.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jonas+Renkse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
