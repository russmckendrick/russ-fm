      "biography": "Def Leppard are an English rock band formed in 1977 in Sheffield. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitars, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitars, backing vocals). They established themselves as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement of the early 1980s.\n\nThe band's greatest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their first album, 1980's On Through the Night, reached the Top 15 in the UK but received little notice elsewhere. Their second album, 1981's High 'n' Dry, was produced by Mutt Lange, who helped them begin to define their melodic, hard rock style, and the album's most popular track \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982, but the album only reached the Top 30 and 40 in the UK and US. Def Leppard's next studio album, Pyromania, was released in January 1983, with \"Photograph\" and \"Rock of Ages\" both topping the US Rock Tracks chart and reaching the Top 20 of the Hot 100. Reaching No. 2 on the US album chart, Pyromania was certified Diamond in the US and 7x platinum in Canada and reached the Top 20 in the UK but did not sell much elsewhere.\n\nDef Leppard's fourth album, the more pop-oriented Hysteria (1987), topped the UK, US, New Zealand, Canadian, Australian and Norway charts. It also went to No. 2 in Sweden and No. 10 in Germany without any Top 50 singles in those countries. It has been certified 12× platinum for sales in the US and 13x platinum in Canada, selling over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album spawned six Top 20 US singles, including the US Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 \"Love Bites\" (went Top 10 in several other countries including No. 2 in NZ), alongside \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" (US No. 2), \"Hysteria\", \"Armageddon It\" (No. 2 in NZ), \"Animal\" (at No. 6, the biggest UK hit), and \"Rocket\" (a Top 15 hit in many countries). Hysteria had four Top 10 hits in New Zealand.\n\nTheir next studio album, Adrenalize (their first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached No. 1 on the UK, US, NZ, Canadian and Australian charts in 1992, while going Top 10 in Sweden and Germany. It contained several hits, including the US Rock Tracks chart-topper, \"Let's Get Rocked\", which became their biggest hit in several countries, including No. 2 in the UK, No. 3 in Canada and Switzerland, and the Top 20 in Sweden and Germany. The third single, \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\", was a Top 15 song in the US, UK and Canada. Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic Top 5 North American hit \"Two Steps Behind\". Their greatest hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK No. 2 hit \"When Love & Hate Collide\" and reached the Top 10 in several countries, going 5x platinum in the US. Beginning with Slang, Def Leppard released five albums between 1996 and 2008, with most usually reaching the Top 15 in several countries, including the UK, US and Canada. Their most recent album, self-titled, was released in 2015 and once again reached the Top 15 in several countries.\n\nAs one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification: Pyromania and Hysteria, making them one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling more than 10 million copies in the US. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and ranked No. 70 in \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.",

      "editorial_notes": "When Def Leppard arrived at the follow-up to their mega-selling third album, 1983’s <i>Pyromania</i>, producer Mutt Lange shared his vision with the Sheffield heavy metal crew. He told them that too many bands were copying their sound and they needed to set themselves apart from the pack. They should, Lange said, make the rock version of <i>Thriller</i>. Released in August 1987, the resultant album <i>Hysteria</i> sold over 20 million copies, which tells you all you need to know about how successful the group were in achieving Lange’s aim. “We ended up having seven singles off of it,” lead guitarist Phil Collen tells Apple Music. “It was mission accomplished. Mutt Lange was amazing, a genius, and I don’t say that lightly.”\n\n<i>Pyromania</i> had infused the group’s metal anthems with an expansive pop sheen, and here they sought to channel an even wider range of influences into their sound. “There was so much great stuff happening, like Prince, Michael Jackson, Frankie Goes to Hollywood—great-sounding records,” says Collen. “Most rock bands are very narrow-minded and stick within a genre, but to us it was anything that sounded great. It was the first time an album in the rock genre was being presented as a pop album. Mutt and us wanted to make a hybrid of AC/DC, full-on rock, and Queen, who were just magical.” After a slow reception initially, <i>Hysteria</i>’s success was given a boost by the success of glam-rock stomper “Pour Some Sugar on Me”. It kick-started a phenomenon. “It blew up,” Collen recalls. “It was a journey making it; we were trying to achieve something. It was great when it started taking shape. It sounded different to anything else out there.” Let Collen guide you through Def Leppard’s swaggering peak, track by track.\n\n<b>“Women”</b>\n“This was the first single in America. Our former manager Cliff Burnstein was like, ‘We really want to connect from a rock point of view. We don’t want to just be this pop band. We’ve got to keep our credibility.’ It didn’t do great as a single, but I think it kept that credibility thing there because it was a rock song and it sounded very Def Leppard. It had that pulsing, the sub-bass and kind of kick drum and massive snare and all of that. I heard that Stevie Wonder and Prince had commented on how great it had sounded when they first heard it.”\n\n<b>“Rocket”</b>\n“We wanted to do something very different. [Singer] Joe Elliott had this idea of doing a drum loop. John Kongos, this guy from South Africa, had a couple of hits in the ’70s and he would loop up drum parts and African drum rhythms, so that’s kind of what we did on this. We created this drum pattern using Fairlight machines, then I did this weird guitar riff, reminiscent of Siouxsie & The Banshees. Before you knew it, we had this kind of unique-sounding drum rhythm with a Siouxsie & The Banshees thing and chanting, Slade-style vocals. It was really super cool, blending all these different genres.”\n\n<b>“Animal”</b>\n“I remember I did a demo for this when we were all living in a house just outside Dublin, which was hysterical, great fun. We actually ended up going to Paris because we’d moved studios, and Joe did this really amazing vocal—and the backing track sounded dated all of a sudden. So we used some of the stuff that Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Trevor Horn were doing on ‘Two Tribes’ and put it into a rock format. We kept the lead vocal and re-modernised the track, recording everything from scratch. All of a sudden, it was more vital.”\n\n<b>“Love Bites”</b>\n“Initially, Mutt Lange wrote this. He played it to me and Steve [Clark, guitarist] and it sounded like a real countrified Don Henley song. We messed around with it for a while, got these different guitar parts, and then Mutt went to town and made it anything but country. It had these soaring vocals, and you can hear Mutt doing the main backing vocals on that track. You can barely hear anyone else! It was the longest vocals that Joe ever done in the studio. It was a real, real struggle. It was just really hard to get a convincing vocal—which is amazing now, considering he kills it every night.”\n\n<b>“Pour Some Sugar on Me”</b> \n“We were finishing up in Holland in this studio in Hilversum, just outside Amsterdam, and Joe was sitting in a hallway playing an acoustic guitar, going, ‘Pour some sugar on me.’ Mutt said, ‘What’s that?’ And Joe goes, ‘I don’t know, I’m just goofing.’ We were actually packing the stuff away and Mutt said, ‘Guys, I really think we should turn this into a song. I know everyone’s going to be really upset with us because we’re so over budget.’ But we nailed that song in 10 days. Mutt thought it was the missing link. Whenever we play that song, it brings out the inner stripper in every male or female. The album didn’t do great at first, but when this song came out, strippers were requesting it on local radio stations in Florida, because they were dancing to it. It started getting traction in Florida. That’s where it kicked this cult following, and from that, it just took off elsewhere. Same deal in Canada. Anywhere there’s a strip club, or a strip club culture, there was a lot of requests on the local radio stations from that.”\n\n<b>“Armageddon It”</b>\n“This was silly. We actually didn’t really finish the song off. We had some guide vocals, ‘Give me all your loving,’ and it was like a T. Rex kind of romp, a rock ’n’ roll groove thing, and we were still kind of working on it. We’d never quite finished it, but everyone was like, ‘Oh yeah, this sounds great!’ It ended up going to No. 3 as a single in the US. It goes down great when we play it now.” \n\n<b>“Gods of War”</b>\n“We pieced this together in Dublin. Steve Clark came up with this great instrumental part at the beginning, and it was like, ‘Wow.’ I’d never heard anything like it; none of us had. And then I had another part that I stuck on the end of it, that worked, and then Sav [bassist Rick Savage] had a part, Joe had a part, and then Mutt was like, ‘We can do all this. It’s not going to be a single, but it could be a great album track.’ You hit every fret on a guitar fingerboard on that song. It keeps changing, then it’s got a pre-chorus, then it’s got a chorus, then it’s got a post-chorus, and it does this kind of Beatle-esque jangle thing at the end, and we used that as an excuse to use all these special effects, like these rockets to show the awful thing that war is, a sonic version of that.”\n\n<b>“Don’t Shoot Shotgun”</b>\n“Again, a pretty-much-not-finished song. It was like we were trying to get a Rolling Stones-type vibe and turned into something else. The chorus was just a marker. We were singing, ‘Don’t shoot shotgun,’ and I have no idea what it meant, we were just using that until a song started forming but it kind of never did. It was like, ‘Oh, well, it kind of sounds cool,’ so we left it at that. The sillier songs and the ones that weren’t quite that serious made the other ones sound even better, for sure. When you listen to it as an album from front to back, it’s like, ‘Wow, this really, really works.’”\n\n<b>“Run Riot”</b>\n“We tried to get an Eddie Cochran vibe on this, but we did a rock version. Joe’s belting this out. If we’d gone back on it, I think we should have had a slightly different chorus, but you can say that about any song until the cows come home. I love the way it came out. It had an energy to it, and a lot of people really liked it for those same reasons. In the context of these songs on <i>Hysteria</i>, it really worked a treat.”\n\n<b>“Hysteria”</b>\n“This is somewhere between a rock song and a ballad. It’s got such a great sing-along thing to it, it’s lovely to play live. We didn’t know what the chorus was going to be, and I think Rick Allen [drums] said, because we were calling the album <i>Hysteria</i>, ‘Why don’t we call that “Hysteria”?’ And then Mutt and Joe turned the lyrics into ‘Hysteria’. It just really made sense, and it was a definite combined effort, this one.”\n\n<b>“Excitable”</b>\n“INXS were doing a great job of doing a rock-band version of the Stones when they would go a bit funky, but INXS made it more like Prince. We were trying to do that. There was a Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson song called ‘State of Shock’ [by The Jacksons], so we used all of these things as a guide. It was like, there’s INXS, there’s Prince, there’s Jackson and Jagger doing this thing, so let’s aim for somewhere in between. We used all this technology with a Fairlight sampler and programming and all that stuff, and Rick Savage actually came up with the idea of it and the riff and everything. It turned into the song, and it was exciting. We’ve been playing it live some nights on tour, and it’s really fun.”\n\n<b>“Love and Affection”</b>\n“I wrote and demoed this in Paris. I used to have an apartment there, and I had my little four-track cassette thing and was sitting in there and making this riff. In the mid-’80s, there was a lot of rock bands like Journey, Bryan Adams, doing these songs that would kind of tick both boxes. They were rock songs, but they appealed to a kind of a poppy audience. This was a song like that. It was different to the other stuff on the record; it had that kind of songwriter thing. When we gave it the Def Leppard treatment, it obviously sounded very different. It was going to be the eighth single, but we stopped at seven. I think ‘Rocket’ ended up being the last single, and after that it was like, ‘OK, guys, you should probably go away and make another record now.’”",

          "standard": "When Def Leppard arrived at the follow-up to their mega-selling third album, 1983’s <i>Pyromania</i>, producer Mutt Lange shared his vision with the Sheffield heavy metal crew. He told them that too many bands were copying their sound and they needed to set themselves apart from the pack. They should, Lange said, make the rock version of <i>Thriller</i>. Released in August 1987, the resultant album <i>Hysteria</i> sold over 20 million copies, which tells you all you need to know about how successful the group were in achieving Lange’s aim. “We ended up having seven singles off of it,” lead guitarist Phil Collen tells Apple Music. “It was mission accomplished. Mutt Lange was amazing, a genius, and I don’t say that lightly.”\n\n<i>Pyromania</i> had infused the group’s metal anthems with an expansive pop sheen, and here they sought to channel an even wider range of influences into their sound. “There was so much great stuff happening, like Prince, Michael Jackson, Frankie Goes to Hollywood—great-sounding records,” says Collen. “Most rock bands are very narrow-minded and stick within a genre, but to us it was anything that sounded great. It was the first time an album in the rock genre was being presented as a pop album. Mutt and us wanted to make a hybrid of AC/DC, full-on rock, and Queen, who were just magical.” After a slow reception initially, <i>Hysteria</i>’s success was given a boost by the success of glam-rock stomper “Pour Some Sugar on Me”. It kick-started a phenomenon. “It blew up,” Collen recalls. “It was a journey making it; we were trying to achieve something. It was great when it started taking shape. It sounded different to anything else out there.” Let Collen guide you through Def Leppard’s swaggering peak, track by track.\n\n<b>“Women”</b>\n“This was the first single in America. Our former manager Cliff Burnstein was like, ‘We really want to connect from a rock point of view. We don’t want to just be this pop band. We’ve got to keep our credibility.’ It didn’t do great as a single, but I think it kept that credibility thing there because it was a rock song and it sounded very Def Leppard. It had that pulsing, the sub-bass and kind of kick drum and massive snare and all of that. I heard that Stevie Wonder and Prince had commented on how great it had sounded when they first heard it.”\n\n<b>“Rocket”</b>\n“We wanted to do something very different. [Singer] Joe Elliott had this idea of doing a drum loop.

            "content": "Hysteria is the fourth studio album by British hard rock band Def Leppard, released in 1987. It is the band's best-selling album to date, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, and spawning seven hit singles. It was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. The title of the album was thought up by drummer Rick Allen, relating to his experiences during the time of his auto accident, and the worldwide media coverage that followed.\n\nThe album was the follow-up to the band's 1983 breakthrough Pyromania. Its creation process was one of the longest ever for a rock album, taking over three years, and was plagued by many trials, such as the December 31, 1984 car accident that cost Rick Allen his left arm.\n\nThe album has had critical acclaim from a number of sources. In 1988 Q magazine readers voted Hysteria as the 98th Greatest Album of All Time, while in 2004, the album was ranked at number 472 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In the Billboard issue dated October 8, 1988, Def Leppard held the number one spot on both the singles and album charts with \"Love Bites\" and Hysteria, respectively.\n\nInitially, Hysteria was to be named \"Animal Instinct\" and produced by Lange, but he dropped out after pre-production sessions, citing exhaustion from a grueling schedule from the past few years. Meat Loaf songwriter Jim Steinman was brought in. Steinman's involvement was a disaster because he was not at all a perfectionist, liking every take the band recorded. Joe Elliott later stated in interview: \"Todd Rundgren produced (Meat Loaf's) Bat out of Hell. Jim Steinman WROTE it.\" After parting ways with Steinman, the band tried to produce the album themselves with Lange's engineer Nigel Green with no success, as initial recordings sessions were entirely scrapped at this point.\n\nOn December 31, 1984, drummer Rick Allen's Corvette flipped off a country road, severing his left arm. Following the accident, the band stood by Allen's decision to return to the drum kit with one arm, using a combination electronic/acoustic kit with a set of footpedals that triggered via MIDI the hits he would have played with his left arm. The band slowly soldiered on until Mutt Lange made a surprise return a year later, and Rick mastered his customized drum kit. However, sessions were further delayed by Lange's own auto accident (sustaining leg injuries from which he quickly recovered) and a bout of the mumps for lead singer Joe Elliott during 1986.\n\nThe final recording sessions took place in January 1987 for the song \"Armageddon It\", but Lange spent another three months mixing the tracks. The album was finally released worldwide on August 3, 1987, with \"Animal\" as the lead single in most countries except for the US where \"Women\" was the first single.\n\nInterestingly, in the liner notes to this album, the band apologized for the long wait between albums, and promised to never make fans wait that long between albums again. Later events, namely Steve Clark's death, would prove this untrue.\n\nFortunately for the band, their popularity in their homeland had significantly grown over the past four years, helping Hysteria to top the charts in Britain in its first week of release. The album was also a major success in other parts of Europe. In the United States though, the band at first struggled to regain the momentum of Pyromania that was lost from such a prolonged absence, but the success of \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" would turn both the band and the album into a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nOn October 24, 2006, a 2-CD \"deluxe edition\" of the album was released, including a re-mastering of the original b-sides and bonus tracks from the album's period. Many of these songs had been featured on Retro Active, albeit with remixes, revamps, and new parts added. The \"Deluxe Edition\" Hysteria deluxe CD included the original b-side versions of these recordings without alterations.\n\nThe album's goal, set out by Lange, was to be a hard rock version of Michael Jackson's Thriller, in that every track was a potential hit single. Songs were therefore written with this concept in mind, disappointing heavy metal fans who clamoured for a straight sequel to Pyromania. \"Love Bites\" was already mostly written in the vein of a country ballad by Mutt Lange when he brought it to the band's attention.\n\nWhile Pyromania contained traces of heavy metal, \"Hysteria\" removed them in favor of the latest sonic technology available at the time (best displayed on \"Rocket\", \"Love Bites\", \"Excitable\", and \"Gods of War\").\n\nAs with Pyromania, every song was recorded by every member in the studio separately instead of the whole band. The multiple vocal harmonies were enhanced by Lange's techniques, even pitching background vocals on all tracks. Guitar parts were now focused more on emphasising melody than hard rock's more basic and cliched riffs. The band used the Rockman amplifier, developed by guitarist Tom Scholz from the rock band Boston, to record the album.\n\nIn addition, all of the album's drum sounds were samples recorded by Lange and the engineers, then played from the Fairlight CMI. In a 1999 interview with Mix Magazine, engineer Mike Shipley noted, \"Pyromania was done the same way, on cheesy 8-bit Fairlight technology where we had to figure out how to record everything at half speed into the Fairlight to make it sound like it had some tone to it, and we'd be stacking up a bunch of snares and bass drums.\" Shipley also noted that the drum sounds were dealt with last because each song's structure could change so radically, and because of technical difficulties.\n\nThis unique approach sometimes led to painstaking lengths of time in the recording studio. The smash single, \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", was the last song written but was quickly finished within two weeks. In sharp contrast, the final version of \"Animal\" took almost a full three years to be developed but did become one of the bigger hits from the album.\n\nIt was a formula (and success) that Lange would later repeat with his now estranged wife Shania Twain in country music with the albums The Woman in Me and Come on Over.\n\nThe iconic album cover was designed by Andie Airfix of Satori, who has done other covers of Def Leppard albums before and since.\n\nHysteria went on to dominate album charts around the world for three years. At 12 times platinum in America alone and another 8 million copies sold outside the US, Hysteria currently sits as the 51st best selling album of all time in the US.\n\nThe leadoff track, \"Women\", was selected as the first single for the US, instead of \"Animal\", in July 1987. Then-manager Cliff Bernstein reasoned that the band needed to reconnect with its hard rock audience first before issuing more Top 40-friendly singles. The strategy backfired somewhat as \"Women\" did not make a large impact on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #80. It was a top 10 hit on the rock chart though, peaking at #7. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Def+Leppard/Hysteria\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band used the Rockman amplifier, developed by guitarist Tom Scholz from the rock band Boston, to record the album.\n\nIn addition, all of the album's drum sounds were samples recorded by Lange and the engineers, then played from the Fairlight CMI. In a 1999 interview with Mix Magazine, engineer Mike Shipley noted, \"Pyromania was done the same way, on cheesy 8-bit Fairlight technology where we had to figure out how to record everything at half speed into the Fairlight to make it sound like it had some tone to it, and we'd be stacking up a bunch of snares and bass drums.\" Shipley also noted that the drum sounds were dealt with last because each song's structure could change so radically, and because of technical difficulties.\n\nThis unique approach sometimes led to painstaking lengths of time in the recording studio. The smash single, \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", was the last song written but was quickly finished within two weeks. In sharp contrast, the final version of \"Animal\" took almost a full three years to be developed but did become one of the bigger hits from the album.\n\nIt was a formula (and success) that Lange would later repeat with his now estranged wife Shania Twain in country music with the albums The Woman in Me and Come on Over.\n\nThe iconic album cover was designed by Andie Airfix of Satori, who has done other covers of Def Leppard albums before and since.\n\nHysteria went on to dominate album charts around the world for three years. At 12 times platinum in America alone and another 8 million copies sold outside the US, Hysteria currently sits as the 51st best selling album of all time in the US.\n\nThe leadoff track, \"Women\", was selected as the first single for the US, instead of \"Animal\", in July 1987. Then-manager Cliff Bernstein reasoned that the band needed to reconnect with its hard rock audience first before issuing more Top 40-friendly singles. The strategy backfired somewhat as \"Women\" did not make a large impact on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #80. It was a top 10 hit on the rock chart though, peaking at #7. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Def+Leppard/Hysteria\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_summary": "Hysteria is the fourth studio album by British hard rock band Def Leppard, released in 1987. It is the band's best-selling album to date, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, and spawning seven hit singles. It was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. The title of the album was thought up by drummer Rick Allen, relating to his experiences during the time of his auto accident, and the worldwide media coverage that followed. The album was the follow-up to the band's 1983 breakthrough Pyromania. Its creation process was one of the longest ever for a rock album, taking over three <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Def+Leppard/Hysteria\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
