      "biography": "Tom Waits (born Thomas Alan Waits, in Pomona, California, on December 7, 1949) is a prolific American singer, songwriter, composer, and actor.\n\nHe started his career in the early 1970s as a singer in spit 'n' sawdust bars. Initially, he was deeply influenced by the beat generation, novelists like Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, and poets like Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski.  Waits is often compared to Charles Bukowski, being similar both in content and lifestyle\n\nWaits was unable to make a living from his music in the 70s because his classical bar music, based in pre-rock, and Americana, blues, and Vaudeville styles were not popular.  Waits's voice back then was soft, warm and clear. \n\nWaits subsequently developed a devoted cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters, despite having little radio or music video support. In fact, his songs are perhaps best known to the general public in the form of cover versions of more visible artists, such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen and Rod Stewart. \n\nAlthough Waits’s albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries.\n\nLyrically, Waits's songs are known for atmospheric portrayals of seedy characters and places; he sings about the losers on the streets: alcoholics, junkies, prostitutes and social outcasts, although he also includes more conventional and touching ballads in his repertoire.  \n\nWhile opening for Frank Zappa, the audience catcalled and refused to listen to him; he was an unsuitable match with Zappa's avantgarde style. \n\nCountless cigarettes, gallons of alcohol and many  all night parties eventually left their trace in his face and voice.\n\nHis more recent gravelly voice can be first heard on Small Change. This distinctive voice turned out to be his trademark. It is described by the Music Hound Rock Album Guide as sounding \"like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car\". Small Change with its sentimental ballads, its bar-jazz attitude and Film Noir-oriented stories turned out to be his biggest commercial success in the 1970s. \n\nWaits subsequently developed a more unique style. His songs have grown more abrasive since then, and the arrangements have turned more surreal and experimental with every new record.  His life brings him to new visions, as indicated by the direction taken in his \"Alice\" release.\n\nWhile composing the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's One From The Heart Waits met Kathleen Brennan, his bride-to-be. They married in 1980 and she helped him quit drinking and smoking.  Since their marriage they have been working together on his albums as co-producers and co-writers. It is hard to say which part belongs to her and which to him, but it's easy to see that they make a perfect team.  Additionally, his eldest son Casey can be heard on turntables and percussion on Waits's album \"Real Gone\".\n\nOne of Waits's greatest successes was the album \"Swordfishtrombones\", released in 1983. It struck with his critics and fans alike. He achieved a new level of song writing and left former conventions (and his earlier career) behind. All songs, whether ballads, jive or jazz are played in a completely different way. It seems that Waits had taken the musical archetypes of these styles and made them his own. All tracks are in the quintessential Waits style. They have a striking rawness and listenability and they set the stage for his success and his future career. \n\nThe Bad As Me Songfacts reports that 36 years after the release of Waits' first album, Closing Time in 1973, Bad As Me became Waits's first ever top 10 album in the US when it debuted at #6 with 63,000 sales. \n\nIn the late 1980s Waits discovered an outlet for his creativity in composing musicals. His first Musical was named \"The Black Rider\", and is based on \"Der Freischütz\" by Carl Maria von Weber. It was co-produced by Robert Wilson and the lyrics come from William S. Burroughs. The story is slightly reminiscent of Kurt Weil's and Berthold Brecht's \"Three Penny Opera\" and the 1930s. The debut performance of the play was in 1990 at the Thalia Theater, Hamburg and has been played by various theatre groups since then.\n\nWaits was also responsible for two other musicals, which later became albums released simultaneously in 2002. One was the musical \"Blood Money,\" which covers the \"Woyczek\" theme of Georg Büchner. This one is one of the darkest works from Waits. The other musical is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". \"Alice\" is very romantic, dreamy and soft, and contains one of Waits most romantic songs. Even though they were released at the same time, the bootlegs of the \"Alice\" musical were long before traded between fans and were just rearranged and re-mastered for the official release.\n\nBesides many film contributions as composer – the Internet Movie Database imdb.com lists 47 appearances of Waits as composer and 38 soundtracks containing songs by Waits - he also is an actor with a total of 25 appearances, ranging from some mini-roles as a trumpeter in \"Heart of Saturday Night\" and the R. M. Renfield in \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" to the major role of Zack in Jim Jarmusch's \"Down by Law\". He recently appeared in Roberto Benigni's \"The Tiger and the Snow\", playing You Can Never Hold Back Spring at Benigni's wedding dream.  Even more recently, Waits played Mr.Nick (the Devil) in Terry Gilliam's \"The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus\".\n\nIn addition to a number of concert videos, he also appeared in the critically-acclaimed concert feature film \"Big Time\" (1990).\n\nWaits has always refused to allow the use of his songs in commercials. He has filed several lawsuits against advertisers for using his material without permission. Waits also successfully sued an advertiser for using a work that was stylistically similar to his work, after he had declined to sell them the rights to his song. He has been quoted as saying, \"Apparently the highest compliment our culture grants artists nowadays is to be in an ad — ideally naked and purring on the hood of a new car.  I have adamantly and repeatedly refused this dubious honor.\" \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "The 1973 debut from Tom Waits introduced one of rock music’s greatest storytellers, a 23-year-old Californian who dripped with the nostalgia and whisky-aged melancholy of a man three times his age. Though never a commercial hit, the songs on <i>Closing Time</i> spent the 1970s as a jumping-off point for covers by the Eagles (“Ol’ ’55”) and Tim Buckley (“Martha”). Still, none of those versions can top Waits’ deeply sentimental performances, performed with a sandpaper rasp that sounded like a smoking engine—especially when compared to commercial contemporaries like Jim Croce and Jackson Browne.\n \nWeaned on Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, Waits was discovered lurking around Los Angeles-area open-mic nights by David Geffen, who signed Waits to Asylum Records, the nascent label that was already home to such acts as the Eagles, Joni Mitchell and Judee Sill. Waits quickly got to work on <i>Closing Time</i>, a street-light symphony that makes Frank Sinatra’s <i>In the Wee Small Hours</i> seem like a party record. Wandering between the piano bar and a folk café, Waits spins tales of loneliness and late nights awash in beer, cigarettes, lazy old tomcats and Greyhounds headed out of town.\n \nThe opening track, “Ol’ ’55”, was written after Waits heard a story about a guy who rushed a date home before curfew time by driving the Pasadena freeway in reverse. In another artist’s hands, that tale would have been little more than a funny anecdote, but Waits uses it to paint a vivid portrait of young love and yearning. Elsewhere on <i>Closing Time</i>, the indelible “I Hope That I Don’t Fall in Love With You” speaks to the kind of bleary-eyed, spotted-from-across-the-bar love that occurs almost entirely in the narrator’s mind, while “Martha” is a pure weeper about a lost love returning after decades: “Operator, number please, it’s been so many years/Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears?” (Bette Midler would eventually perform “Martha” on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.) And while the album includes everything from rollicking soul (“Ice Cream Man”) to steel-guitar ballads (“Rosie”) to country waltzes (“Old Shoes (& Picture Postcards)”), the 12 tracks on <i>Closing Time</i> are undeniably “Tom Waits songs”, each imbued with his unmistakable voice and atmosphere.\n \nLike all of Waits’ 1970s material, <i>Closing Time</i> was more of a cult object than a commercial breakthrough. But as the decades passed, the album established itself as a one-man standards collection, its evocative songs covered by a remarkably disparate group of artists, including Jon Bon Jovi, Meat Loaf, Screamin’ Jay Hawkins, 10,000 Maniacs, Hootie & the Blowfish, Sarah McLachlan, Bat for Lashes—and countless more. As Waits once remarked about “I Hope That I Don’t Fall in Love With You”: “You take all the bar songs in the world and put ’em together, they’d stretch all the way to Kansas City, I guess—millions of them. This is just another one.” He was right to some extent. But the march of time—and the increasing affection for <i>Closing Time</i>—would also prove him very wrong.",

And while the album includes everything from rollicking soul (“Ice Cream Man”) to steel-guitar ballads (“Rosie”) to country waltzes (“Old Shoes (& Picture Postcards)”), the 12 tracks on <i>Closing Time</i> are undeniably “Tom Waits songs”, each imbued with his unmistakable voice and atmosphere.\n \nLike all of Waits’ 1970s material, <i>Closing Time</i> was more of a cult object than a commercial breakthrough. But as the decades passed, the album established itself as a one-man standards collection, its evocative songs covered by a remarkably disparate group of artists, including Jon Bon Jovi, Meat Loaf, Screamin’ Jay Hawkins, 10,000 Maniacs, Hootie & the Blowfish, Sarah McLachlan, Bat for Lashes—and countless more. As Waits once remarked about “I Hope That I Don’t Fall in Love With You”: “You take all the bar songs in the world and put ’em together, they’d stretch all the way to Kansas City, I guess—millions of them. This is just another one.” He was right to some extent. But the march of time—and the increasing affection for <i>Closing Time</i>—would also prove him very wrong."

            "content": "Tom Waits' Closing Time is the debut album and title track of the American singer-songwriter, released on March 6, 1973, by Asylum Records. This groundbreaking album not only marked the beginning of Waits' musical journey but also established his signature style of crafting minor-key masterpieces that capture the essence of urban solitude and late-night contemplation. The album's atmospheric sound would later influence artists like Bruce Springsteen and Nick Cave in their approach to storytelling through music.\nProducer: Jerry Yester (former member of Lovin' Spoonful) - whose experience with folk-rock arrangements proved instrumental in shaping the album's sound\nRecording: Early 1972 at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California - a legendary studio that had previously hosted The Doors and later welcomed Prince\nGenre: Predominantly folk-influenced with jazz, pop, and saloon music elements, creating a unique fusion that would later be termed \"barroom ballads\"\nLength: 45:46 - deliberately crafted to fit the optimal length of vinyl LP format of the era\n\n\nClosing Time introduced Waits' unique Los Angeles barfly persona, blending jazzy, sorrowful intrigue with gritty, countercultural street poetry. The album's distinctive sound was achieved through a combination of vintage microphones and recording techniques that captured the warmth and intimacy of live performance. Within the apparently narrow range of cocktail bar pianistics and muttered vocals, the album features a surprisingly broad collection of styles, from jazzy compositions to acoustic folk, creating intimate late-night barroom soundscapes.\n\nThe album contains 12 songs, all written and composed by Tom Waits, showcasing his gift for gently rolling pop melodies and striking, original scenarios. Each song was carefully arranged to maintain the delicate balance between raw emotion and polished musicianship. Some standout tracks include:\n\n- Ol' '55: Released as the lead single, considered one of the album's best songs. The song was famously covered by Eagles in 1974, bringing Waits' songwriting to a broader audience\n- Martha: A highly rated fan favorite enhanced by Yester's discreet string arrangements, telling a poignant story of lost love through the lens of a phone call between former lovers\n- Virginia Avenue: A jazzy piece demonstrating the album's range, featuring intricate piano work inspired by Bill Evans\n- I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love With You: Showcasing acoustic folk and what would become Waits' trademark narrative storytelling style\n- Closing Time: The instrumental title track, recorded as an afterthought but considered magical by producer Jerry Yester. The piece features innovative use of space and silence as musical elements\n\nClosing Time is often regarded as a perfect \"late night alone\" album, ideal for relaxing with a cold beer. Its influence can be heard in contemporary artists like The National and Iron & Wine, who have cited the album as an inspiration for their own intimate songwriting approaches. While it's considered the least distinct Tom Waits album compared to his later experimental works, it holds a unique place in his eclectic discography as a self-conscious yet surprisingly moving collection. The album has stood the test of time, recently celebrating its 50th anniversary, and has been remastered multiple times to preserve its sonic quality for new generations of listeners.\n\nThe title track Closing Time is an instrumental piece that encapsulates the album's themes of melancholy and nostalgia. It features Tom Waits on piano, Tony Terran on trumpet (known for his work with Frank Sinatra), Jesse Erlich on cello (a respected session musician who worked with Leonard Cohen), and Arni Egilsson on double bass. The song evokes the atmosphere of a late-night bar or dimly lit lounge as patrons leave and the evening draws to a close, utilizing subtle dynamic changes and space between notes to create its distinctive mood. The piece has since become a standard in jazz education programs as an example of effective minimal composition. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Closing+Time\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
