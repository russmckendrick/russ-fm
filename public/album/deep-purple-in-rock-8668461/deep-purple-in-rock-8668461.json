      "biography": "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in London, in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock but their musical approach has changed over the years.Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.\n\nDeep Purple have had several line-up changes and were broken up for eight years from 1976 to 1984, with drummer Ian Paice being the band's only constant member. The first four line-ups, which constituted the band's original 1968–1976 run, are officially indicated as Mark I (1968–1969), Mark II (1969–1973), Mark III (1973–1975) and Mark IV (1975–1976). Mark I comprised the founding members of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Rod Evans (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Paice (drums) and Nick Simper (bass), while Mark II was the most commercially successful line-up, with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover replacing Evans and Simper respectively. Mark III saw David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes replace Gillan and Glover respectively, while Mark IV featured Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore. The band split in July 1976 and Bolin died from a drug overdose five months later. In 1984, Deep Purple reformed with the Mark II line-up, which remained in place until Joe Lynn Turner replaced Gillan in 1989. Gillan rejoined in 1992, with Blackmore leaving for the second and final time the following year. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse. In 2002 Don Airey replaced Jon Lord, which saw Deep Purple settle into its longest running line-up, unchanged for the next twenty years, until Morse announced his departure from the band in 2022. His place was taken by Simon McBride. Paice, Glover, Gillan, Airey and McBride comprise the current line-up of Deep Purple.\n\nDeep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme] and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale, Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Deep Purple in Rock (also known as In Rock) is an album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in June 1970. It was their fourth studio album, and the first with the classic Mk II lineup. Deep Purple in Rock was their breakthrough album in Europe and would peak at #4 in the UK, remaining in the charts for months. Album was supported by the hugely successful In Rock World Tour which lasted 15 months.\n\nAlthough this was the first studio album to feature the MK II lineup of the band, it was this lineup that had earlier recorded the Concerto for Group and Orchestra.\n\nDeep Purple's earlier work ranged from psychedelic hard rock to orchestra-driven tracks and covers that ranged from The Beatles to Neil Diamond, among others, but on this record all tracks are credited to the five members of the band. \"Speed King\" and \"Flight of the Rat\" are hard rock songs, and the 10-minute epic \"Child in Time\", perhaps the most famous song from this record, would be a concert staple for years to come.\n\nAlthough \"Into the Fire\" and \"Speed King\" were featured on the set lists at the time, \"Child in Time\" was the only song from this album that was included on Made in Japan two years later (although \"Speed King\" was the usual encore and is featured on the expanded CD re-issue, as is \"Black Night\" which was included in the Deep Purple in Rock re-issue).\n\nThe cover depicts the band in a rock sculpture inspired by Mount Rushmore.\n\nIn 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 78 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\n\nJon Lord used both the Leslie speaker, and a Marshall amplifier with his Hammond organ, therefore the organ sound varies a lot throughout the songs. (Example: \"Living Wreck\" - Leslie speaker, \"Hard Lovin' Man\" - Marshall amplifier).\n\nRitchie Blackmore used a Gibson guitar on \"Child in Time\", not his usual Fender Stratocaster. This album is his favorite, along with Machine Head.\n\nIn some countries including Mexico, Deep Purple in Rock also included \"Black Night\", a single recorded during the sessions.\n\nThe US release of the album cut the intro to Speed King, lasting just over a minute. It remains edited on the standard Warner Bros. US release, but is restored to full length on the 25th anniversary package (released in 1995).\n\nOn July 21, 2009 audiophile label Audio Fidelity released a remastered version of Deep Purple In Rock on a limited edition 24 karat gold CD. Mastering for the CD was performed by notable audio engineer Steve Hoffman. This release follows the original 7-track format with no bonus tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple/Deep+Purple+In+Rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Deep Purple in Rock (also known as In Rock) is an album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in June 1970. It was their fourth studio album, and the first with the classic Mk II lineup. Deep Purple in Rock was their breakthrough album in Europe and would peak at #4 in the UK, remaining in the charts for months. Album was supported by the hugely successful In Rock World Tour which lasted 15 months.\n\nAlthough this was the first studio album to feature the MK II lineup of the band, it was this lineup that had earlier recorded the Concerto for Group and Orchestra.\n\nDeep Purple's earlier work ranged from psychedelic hard rock to orchestra-driven tracks and covers that ranged from The Beatles to Neil Diamond, among others, but on this record all tracks are credited to the five members of the band. \"Speed King\" and \"Flight of the Rat\" are hard rock songs, and the 10-minute epic \"Child in Time\", perhaps the most famous song from this record, would be a concert staple for years to come.\n\nAlthough \"Into the Fire\" and \"Speed King\" were featured on the set lists at the time, \"Child in Time\" was the only song from this album that was included on Made in Japan two years later (although \"Speed King\" was the usual encore and is featured on the expanded CD re-issue, as is \"Black Night\" which was included in the Deep Purple in Rock re-issue).\n\nThe cover depicts the band in a rock sculpture inspired by Mount Rushmore.\n\nIn 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 78 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\n\nJon Lord used both the Leslie speaker, and a Marshall amplifier with his Hammond organ, therefore the organ sound varies a lot throughout the songs. (Example: \"Living Wreck\" - Leslie speaker, \"Hard Lovin' Man\" - Marshall amplifier).\n\nRitchie Blackmore used a Gibson guitar on \"Child in Time\", not his usual Fender Stratocaster. This album is his favorite, along with Machine Head.\n\nIn some countries including Mexico, Deep Purple in Rock also included \"Black Night\", a single recorded during the sessions.\n\nThe US release of the album cut the intro to Speed King, lasting just over a minute. It remains edited on the standard Warner Bros. US release, but is restored to full length on the 25th anniversary package (released in 1995).\n\nOn July 21, 2009 audiophile label Audio Fidelity released a remastered version of Deep Purple In Rock on a limited edition 24 karat gold CD. Mastering for the CD was performed by notable audio engineer Steve Hoffman. This release follows the original 7-track format with no bonus tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Purple/Deep+Purple+In+Rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
