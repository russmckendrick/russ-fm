  "biography": "Level 42 are an English pop rock and jazz-funk band who had a number of worldwide and UK hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe band gained fame for their high-calibre musicianship-in particular that of Mark King, whose percussive slap-bass guitar technique provided the driving groove of many of the band's hits. The band are also known for the combination of King's lead vocals and keyboard player Mike Lindup's falsetto backing vocals.\n\nHaving been a very successful live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42's commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. After disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001.\n\nTheir most successful single was \"Something About You\", which reached number six on the UK Singles chart, and number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1985.",

They had the several UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\nTheir highest-charting single in the UK was \"Lessons in Love\", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, \"Something About You\", was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. After much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42\\'s commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001. \\n\\nHistory\\n1979–1980: Prehistory and formation:\\nMark King and the Gould brothers (Phil and Rowland, the latter was generally known by his nickname Boon) were all brought up on the Isle of Wight and played together in various bands during their teenage years. Phil Gould went on to study at London\\'s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he met keyboard player Mike Lindup in a percussion course. Both musicians found that they had the same feelings about musical heroes: Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, and Jan Hammer.\\n\\nBy 1979, Phil Gould and Mark King were both based in London and became involved in Robin Scott\\'s pop project M. While working with M, they became acquainted with Afro-French keyboard player Wally Badarou, who played synthesizer on M\\'s US number-one single \"Pop Muzik\". In late 1979, Phil Gould introduced Mark King and Mike Lindup to each other, and all of them began playing together in loose rehearsal sessions, developing their jazz-funk fusion style. The developing band\\'s original guitarist was Dominic Miller (later to find fame playing with Sting), but he was replaced by Boon Gould on the latter\\'s return from working in the United States.\\n\\nInitially, instrumental roles were flexible, with Boon Gould also playing bass guitar and saxophone and Lindup doubling on keyboards and drums. Mark King was primarily a drummer (although he also played guitar) but had recently sold his drum kit to pay for transport back to the UK after an ill-fated European venture. With Phil Gould and Boon Gould established (respectively) as the most accomplished drummer and guitarist in the quartet, King opted to learn bass guitar instead. At the time, King was working in a London music store. A notably flexible musician and quick learner, he had observed visiting American funk players demonstrating the thumb-slap bass guitar technique and developed his take on the style in a matter of weeks.\\n\\nThe developing band (at this point, entirely an instrumental act) took the name Level 42 and settled on a working line-up of King (bass guitar, percussion), Lindup (keyboards, percussion), Boon Gould (guitar, saxophone), and Phil Gould (drums). The name of the band is a reference to the novel The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, in which \"42\" is the answer to \"the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\" Having maintained their links with Wally Badarou, Phil Gould, and Mark King invited him to work with Level 42. Although he never formally joined the band, Badarou would become a fifth member in all but name: co-writing songs, playing keyboards and synthesizers in the studio, and co-producing the records.\\n\\n1980–1983: Early albums (Level 42, The Early Tapes, The Pursuit of Accidents)\\nAfter they were seen, jamming together, Level 42 were invited to sign to Elite Records (a small independent label) in 1980. They were also encouraged to branch out into vocal music. Having considered recruiting a singer, the band eventually settled on giving King and Lindup the vocal role. The two men developed a complementary style, with Lindup\\'s falsetto frequently used for harmonies and choruses while King\\'s deep tenor led the verses (although Lindup would also sing entire songs on his own). The Gould brothers generally wrote lyrics while King, Badarou, and Lindup concentrated on Level 42\\'s music.\\n\\nThe Elite Records single \"Love Meeting Love\" brought the band to the attention of Polydor Records, with whom they signed their second recording contract. In 1981, they released their first Polydor single, \"Love Games\", which became a Top 40 hit. They then cut their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, which was an immediate success throughout Europe.\\n\\nThe band quickly established themselves as concert favorites on the budding British and European jazz-funk scene, taking advantage of the musical expertise and performance skills of all four members.[citation needed] Polydor capitalized on the band\\'s success by releasing a second album, The Early Tapes later in the same year. This was a compilation of material from the Elite Records period (and is also known by an alternate name, Strategy).\\n\\nIn 1982, Level 42 released their third album The Pursuit of Accidents. This was a further development of the Level 42 formula, maintaining their instrumental jazz-funk skills and styling but also experimenting further with pop songs. Both of the singles from the album — \"Weave Your Spell\" and \"The Chinese Way\" — charted. The latter, in particular, raised high in the charts and gained the band a much wider audience than before.\\n\\n1983–1985: Moving towards pop (Standing in the Light and True Colours):\\nA fourth album, Standing in the Light, was released in 1983. Produced by Larry Dunn and Verdine White (of Earth, Wind & Fire), this album began a new era for the band, being less experimental and less jazzy than previous releases. It provided them with their first UK Top Ten hit, \"The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\". Notably, the album featured no instrumental tracks, with the band now focusing heavily on songs. (The band would not release another instrumental on an album until 1988\\'s Staring at the Sun).\\n\\nThe 1984 album True Colours continued the band\\'s development away from primarily jazz-funk based music, switching between funk, power pop, mid-tempo rock, and moody ballads. It yielded the singles \"The Chant Has Begun\" and \"Hot Water\". The latter was a Top 20 hit in Britain and a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands where the band became popular (the song reached also No. 7 in Belgium). During the same year, Mark King released his first solo album Influences on which he played the majority of the instruments (with a guest appearance by Aswad\\'s Drummie Zeb, and with Lindup guesting on additional keyboards).\\n\\nLevel 42 became known for their power as a live band (as showcased on the 1985 double live album A Physical Presence). For live gigs the band added saxophonist Krys Mach, who toured with the group from 1984 to 1988 and contributed to some album recordings.\\n\\n1985–1987: Worldwide fame (World Machine and Running in the Family) and split of the original line-up\\nBy this time, the band was well established in their mainstream pop/rock sound, as evidenced on their next studio album, World Machine, released later in 1985. King\\'s dextrous bass playing and Lindup and Badarou\\'s chugging keyboards acted as templates for pop songs such as \"Something About You\" and \"Leaving Me Now\", which were both UK Top 20 hits (Top 40 hits in the Netherlands).\\n\\nSignificantly, \"Something About You\" was also their first (and only) US Top 10 the following year; also reaching the Top 5 in Canada and the Top 20 in Italy and New Zealand. \"Leaving Me Now\" was the second hit from this album, peaking at No. 15 in the United Kingdom but proving less successful in Europe. Elements of Level 42\\'s roots could still be found in the funky \"Coup d\\'État\" and \"Dream Crazy\" on the UK version of the album, as well as a long instrumental track named \"Hell,\" which was also recorded during the World Machine sessions (This last track did not see the light of day until the early 2000s as an MP3 download on the original Napster).\\n\\nWorld Machine gained positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic journalist William Cooper, in a retrospective review, describing it as \"one of the finest pop albums of the mid-\\'80s.\" During the recording of the album, the first major tensions between Phil Gould and Mark King began to surface over musical direction, production, and their relationship. This clashing led to Gould leaving the band for a week. Allan Holdsworth\\'s drummer Gary Husband was lined up as a potential replacement, but Gould and King\\'s dispute was subsequently patched up and the group went on to enjoy their most successful year to date.\\n\\nReleased in early 1986 (and initially recorded to keep up the band\\'s European chart momentum while the band was busy touring the United States), \"Lessons in Love\" was an international hit and became Level 42\\'s biggest selling single.[citation needed] It gave the band their first number one in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and South Africa, increasing the band\\'s popularity considerably. It also placed at No. 2 in Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, No. 3 in the UK and Ireland, No. 4 in Austria, No. 10 in Norway, No. 12 in the US in 1987, No. 18 in New Zealand, and No. 22 in France).\\n\\n\"Lessons in Love\" became the lead single on 1987\\'s Running in the Family album, recorded to capitalize on the impact. With the band now at the peak of their success, the album added further gloss to Level 42\\'s polished pop sound (despite adding to Phil Gould\\'s disquiet). Further singles from the album continued and built on the band\\'s existing profile: \"To Be With You Again\" (No. 6 in the Netherlands and Ireland), the ballad \"It\\'s Over\" (No. 3 in Ireland and No. 7 in the Netherlands) and Running In The Family\\'s title track (No. 1 in Denmark, No. 3 in the Netherlands, No. 4 in Ireland, No. 5 in Switzerland, No. 7 in Norway and No. 9 in New Zealand). The album itself was a major international success, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries.\\n\\nBy now a leading British pop band, Level 42 played at the Prince\\'s Trust concert in June 1987, with Eric Clapton standing in on lead guitar for a performance of \"Running in the Family\". King and Lindup also performed with artists including Ben E. King on \"Stand By Me\" and George Harrison and Ringo Starr on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\\n\\nDespite the success, Level 42 was on the brink of splitting up. Although Phil Gould was the most visibly dissatisfied member, Boon Gould was the first to leave, departing in late 1987, following a support slot on a Madonna tour. The quietest member of the band, Boon surprised both King and Lindup with his sudden departure. However, he had been suffering from nervous exhaustion and wanted to leave the lifestyle of a constantly touring musician to settle down and spend more time with his wife and children. Boon\\'s relationship with the band remained amicable and, although he would not return to Level 42 as a performing or recording member, he continued to write lyrics for the band following his departure. Paul Gendler (an experienced session player who had previously been the guitarist for Modern Romance) temporarily replaced him for a six-week headlining tour and further support slots with Tina Turner.\\n\\nIn December 1987, midway through the tour, Phil Gould left Level 42 permanently. Like his brother, he was suffering from exhaustion, but his relationship with King had broken down once again and they now found it difficult to work together. Phil was also reportedly dissatisfied with the band\\'s direction in terms of their newer \"pop\" sound, and King and Lindup failed to convince him to stay. To complete the tour dates, the band hired Prefab Sprout drummer Neil Conti to fill in.\\n\\n1988–1989: The second line-up (Staring at the Sun):\\nFollowing the tour, Level 42 recruited Gary Husband as the band\\'s new full-time drummer. He in turn recommended Steve Topping as a replacement guitarist. However, Topping and King\\'s personalities clashed and Topping eventually left the band in early 1988 after initial writing and rehearsing sessions in Dublin. Most of the next Level 42 album, Staring at the Sun, was recorded without a permanent guitarist. Rhythm guitar on the studio recordings was handled either by the band\\'s old friend Dominic Miller or by an uncredited Mark King. In April 1988, towards the end of the sessions, the band recruited lead guitarist Alan Murphy (a session guitarist who had worked extensively with Kate Bush and had been a member of Go West).\\n\\nStaring at the Sun was released in 1988, reaching number 2 in the UK and the top ten in several European charts. It included the hit single \"Heaven in My Hands\" (number 12 in the UK and the top twenty in the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland). Boon Gould had co-written many of the tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou, while Gary Husband was credited with his first co-write with King on \"Tracie\" (a tribute to King\\'s childhood sweetheart). To promote the album, Level 42 embarked on a four-month European tour, culminating in six sell-out nights at Wembley Arena. These latter dates were recorded for what would become the band\\'s second live album, Live At Wembley (eventually released in 1996).\\n\\nAlthough the band seemed to have maintained their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they were about to be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something that he may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy\\'s reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.\\n\\nDevastated, Level 42 took a year off to regroup and rethink. To cover the gap and to fulfill the band\\'s contract with Polydor Records, Level Best (a greatest hits compilation) was released at the end of 1989; also marking a decade since the band\\'s beginnings. During the break, Mike Lindup also recorded and released his debut solo album, Changes (featuring Dominic Miller, Pino Palladino on bass and Manu Katché on drums).\\n\\n1990–1992: Third and fourth lineups – Guaranteed album, Allan Holdsworth and Jakko Jakszyk:\\nThe band signed a new contract with RCA Records in 1990, for whom they produced their next album, Guaranteed. Although Dominic Miller once again handled most of the rhythm guitar work, Gary Husband asked Allan Holdsworth to provide some guitar work (notably on \"A Kinder Eye\"). As well as drumming, Husband also played keyboards and increased his songwriting role, co-writing many tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou. The album features the only track entirely written by Husband – \"If You Were Mine\" – that also featured on the \"Guaranteed\" single release. Mark King also collaborated with lyricists Drew Barfield and George Green to expand the songwriting. Guaranteed was well received by American music critics. However, the album did not get good reviews in the UK (despite reaching No. 3 in the UK charts while the title track reached No. 17 in the singles charts) and was ultimately less commercially successful than previous efforts.\\n\\nIn December 1990, Level 42 returned to play a record run of concerts at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in part fulfilling booking obligations preceding the band\\'s recent hiatus. The concerts featured Allan Holdsworth (whom Husband had asked to play as a favor while the band searched for a permanent guitarist) plus four additional players: Lyndon Connah (ex-64 Spoons) on additional keyboards and percussion and sharing backing vocals with Annie McCaig, plus the horn section from the Guaranteed album (John Thirkell and Gary Barnacle).\\n\\nAfter the recording of Guaranteed and a weeklong promotional tour, Level 42 needed a permanent guitarist. Mark King assumed (erroneously) that Allan Holdsworth would not be interested in taking the position. Instead, the band recruited well-respected art-pop guitarist, session player, and sometime solo artist Jakko Jakszyk: the former frontman for 64 Spoons, he had also collaborated with Tom Robinson, Sam Brown, and Stewart/Gaskin among others. Although he did not play on Guaranteed, Jakszyk appeared on the album\\'s cover photo and took part in promotional duties and the tour for the album, as well as playing on two B-sides from this era (\"At This Great Distance\" and \"As Years Go By\").\\n\\nUnlike Husband, Jakszyk never became a full legal member of the band (apparently due to \"record company politics\"). However, following the end of promotion for Guaranteed, the King-Lindup-Husband-Jakszyk line began writing and recording new material together, with at least two songs (\"Fire\" and \"Free Your Soul\") completed. Following the next development in the band\\'s history, this work was shelved and remains unreleased.\\n\\n1993–1994: Fifth and sixth lineups (including the brief return of Phil Gould), Forever Now and disbandment\\nIn early 1993, Gary Husband left Level 42, leading to the return of group founder member Phil Gould as Level 42\\'s drummer (and principal lyricist) for 1994\\'s Forever Now album. Further changes to the band were evident in that Jakko Jakszyk did not play on the album: the American session guitarist Danny Blume (erroneously credited as “Danny Bloom” performed all guitars.\\n\\nAlthough Forever Now was a critical success, the reunion of Gould and the group was short-lived. When Level 42 began to promote the new album (with Jakszyk returning to the live band for concerts and TV appearances), Gould played only one promotional gig and did not go on the road for the Forever Now tour. Jakszyk’s friend and frequent collaborator Gavin Harrison (who later played drums for both Porcupine Tree and King Crimson) replaced him as a live drummer.\\n\\nIt was announced halfway through the Forever Now tour, on the day of the Manchester Apollo gig, which the band would be disbanding permanently following their concert commitments. Level 42 played their last gig at the Albert Hall in London on 14 October 1994. According to Jakszyk, the band recorded tapes for a live album during the final 1994 shows at the Albert Hall and the Brighton Dome which \"sounded fantastic\", but the album was never released.\\n\\n1996–2000: Mark King\\'s solo years:\\nIn 1996, Mark King signed to Virgin Records and released a solo single \"Bitter Moon\" (with Lyndon Connah playing keyboards). This was followed up by his second solo album One Man, featuring lyrics by Boon Gould. The album was not a big commercial success. \\n\\nKing later toured as a solo act, playing his new compositions and some Level 42 favorites. In 1999, he played some shows at the Jazz Cafe in London under the name of \"The Mark King Group\" with a band including Husband, Jakszyk, and Jakszyk\\'s fellow former 64 Spoons colleague Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Jakszyk left the band after the Jazz Cafe shows, to be replaced on guitar by Nathan King (Mark King\\'s younger brother). King continued to tour with this band, now renamed \"Grupo Mark King\", over the next couple of years, augmenting the line-up with saxophone player Sean Freeman.\\n\\nIn August 1999, three-quarters of the original Level 42 line-up reunited for a private show. Phil Gould invited some musician friends to play at a party, including his brother Boon and Mike Lindup. In 2001, Mark King, Mike Lindup, and Phil Gould played together at Lindup\\'s wedding for the first time in ten years.[citation needed]\\n\\n2001–2005: Return of Level 42 (seventh lineup):\\nAlthough Mark King released two solo albums, his previous band\\'s music proved to be persistently popular and he found that he was playing more and more old Level 42 tracks at live shows.\\n\\nIn late 2001, King came to a business agreement with Mike Lindup and bought the rights to the name Level 42. Although Lindup agreed to play on future albums, he did not want to tour.[citation needed] King announced the return of Level 42 with a new line-up which also happened to be the musicians from his current live band: himself, Husband, Connah, Freeman, and Nathan King. On 12 July 2002, the first official Level 42 concert for six years was played at The Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. While not recording any new material, for the next few years the band settled into a regular pattern of touring and playing old hits.\\n\\nOn 13 February 2005, there was a brief one-night reunion with Mike Lindup (who joined the band onstage for a date at The Forum in London)[citation needed] and over the year, there was a burst of reissue activity. Two Rockpalast shows from 1983 and 1984 were released on DVD, followed by two CD releases: The River Sessions (a live show from 1983 recorded in Scotland) and a new compilation called The Ultimate Collection II. The latter included a new song called \"Genius Of Love\", which was a Level 42 tribute/collaboration by the Italian-American dance producer Hardage, featuring Mark King on vocals and incorporating a sample of the Level 42 track \"I Want Eyes\".\\n\\n2006–2012: Retroglide and further tours and lineup changes:\\nIn February 2006, after twelve years without releasing a new studio album, Level 42 announced the release of Retroglide. While billed as a band album, it was chiefly recorded and produced by King at his home studio, with Gary Husband, Lyndon Connah, Sean Freeman, and Nathan King all contributing.\\n\\nRetroglide also featured input from two previous Level 42 members. Erstwhile guitarist Boon Gould provided the album\\'s lyrics (as well as contributing a guitar solo on \"Ship\") and Mike Lindup, who added prominent keyboard parts and vocals to many tracks, effectively expanded the band to a six-piece via extensive guest performances. Although Phil Gould was uncredited on the album, the track \"Ship\" is the first song since 1986 worked on by all four original members, as Phil originally arranged the track with his brother Boon. However, Retroglide was also the first Level 42 album not to feature any contributions from Wally Badarou.\\n\\nIn May 2006, Level 42 announced that Mike Lindup would return full-time to replace Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Retroglide was promoted via a supporting tour throughout the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and several other European countries during October 2006. On 26 August 2007, Level 42 played an outdoor gig at the Arundel Festival in West Sussex: the band\\'s only UK show of the year. In 2008, Level 42 played a twenty-date UK tour.\\n\\nIn 2010, Husband stepped down as Level 42\\'s drummer for the second time, due to prior commitments with John McLaughlin. Pete Ray Biggin replaced Husband. In 2012, Level 42 toured the UK and mainland Europe, in celebration of the 25th anniversary since the release of Running in the Family, by playing the whole album, with a whole array of other hits. Also included in the shows was an acoustic set, with Mike Lindup playing the accordion. In October 2012, on Mark King\\'s birthday during a gig in Bristol, Boon Gould joined the band on stage.\\n\\n2013–present: \"Sirens\" EP series and re-engagement with contemporary dance-pop:\\nOn 20 and 21 September 2013, Level 42 (joined by an expanded brass section), performed three new songs at London\\'s Indigo O2 Arena – \"Where\\'s Yo\\' Head At\", \"Too Much Time\", and \"Sirens\". All of these appeared on the band\\'s first new release for seven years, the six-song studio EP \"Sirens\" (released on 31 October 2013, and the first output from the band\\'s new self-owned label Level 42 Records). Mixed by the American DJ John Morales, the EP also contained \"Mind on You\", \"My Independence Day\" and \"Build Myself a Rocket\" (with King\\'s daughter Marlee providing the backing vocals on the last of these tracks). Musically, it built on the production approach of Retroglide while allying the band with contemporary developments in R&B and dance electronic.\\n\\nOn 3 December 2013, the band announced \\'The Sirens Tour\\' – a 30-date tour, starting in October 2014 and taking in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. In the summer of 2014, the band performed at several festivals across Europe including headline performances at Let\\'s Rock Bristol and Rochester Castle. They also played at Rewind festivals. At a performance in Bournemouth, ex-drummer Gary Husband returned due to Pete Ray Biggin being unavailable.\\n\\nIn 2015, the band appeared at a number of the UK and European festivals headlining at \\'Let\\'s Rock the Moor\\' and \\'Carfest\\' concerts. They also played two nights at the Indigo2 in London where the band once again featured a larger brass section consisting of Dan Carpenter (trumpet) and Nicol Thomson (trombone) as well as regular saxophonist Sean Freeman.\\n\\nIn 2016, Level 42 performed at several festivals across the UK and Europe as well as in Curaçao, Chile, and Argentina before embarking on the UK, Netherlands, and Scandinavian tour to promote the \"Sirens II\" EP. On 1 May 2019, it was announced that Boon Gould had been found dead at his home in Dorset. He was 64. On 4 July 2019, Level 42 made a rare North American incursion, being the band to perform the first concert to launch the week-long «Festival d\\'été de Québec» (Quebec City Summer Festival). A rare treat for North American fans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Level+42\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They had the several UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\nTheir highest-charting single in the UK was \"Lessons in Love\", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, \"Something About You\", was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. After much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42\\'s commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001. \\n\\nHistory\\n1979–1980: Prehistory and formation:\\nMark King and the Gould brothers (Phil and Rowland, the latter was generally known by his nickname Boon) were all brought up on the Isle of Wight and played together in various bands during their teenage years. Phil Gould went on to study at London\\'s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he met keyboard player Mike Lindup in a percussion course. Both musicians found that they had the same feelings about musical heroes: Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, and Jan Hammer.\\n\\nBy 1979, Phil Gould and Mark King were both based in London and became involved in Robin Scott\\'s pop project M. While working with M, they became acquainted with Afro-French keyboard player Wally Badarou, who played synthesizer on M\\'s US number-one single \"Pop Muzik\". In late 1979, Phil Gould introduced Mark King and Mike Lindup to each other, and all of them began playing together in loose rehearsal sessions, developing their jazz-funk fusion style. The developing band\\'s original guitarist was Dominic Miller (later to find fame playing with Sting), but he was replaced by Boon Gould on the latter\\'s return from working in the United States.\\n\\nInitially, instrumental roles were flexible, with Boon Gould also playing bass guitar and saxophone and Lindup doubling on keyboards and drums. Mark King was primarily a drummer (although he also played guitar) but had recently sold his drum kit to pay for transport back to the UK after an ill-fated European venture. With Phil Gould and Boon Gould established (respectively) as the most accomplished drummer and guitarist in the quartet, King opted to learn bass guitar instead. At the time, King was working in a London music store. A notably flexible musician and quick learner, he had observed visiting American funk players demonstrating the thumb-slap bass guitar technique and developed his take on the style in a matter of weeks.\\n\\nThe developing band (at this point, entirely an instrumental act) took the name Level 42 and settled on a working line-up of King (bass guitar, percussion), Lindup (keyboards, percussion), Boon Gould (guitar, saxophone), and Phil Gould (drums). The name of the band is a reference to the novel The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, in which \"42\" is the answer to \"the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\" Having maintained their links with Wally Badarou, Phil Gould, and Mark King invited him to work with Level 42. Although he never formally joined the band, Badarou would become a fifth member in all but name: co-writing songs, playing keyboards and synthesizers in the studio, and co-producing the records.\\n\\n1980–1983: Early albums (Level 42, The Early Tapes, The Pursuit of Accidents)\\nAfter they were seen, jamming together, Level 42 were invited to sign to Elite Records (a small independent label) in 1980. They were also encouraged to branch out into vocal music. Having considered recruiting a singer, the band eventually settled on giving King and Lindup the vocal role. The two men developed a complementary style, with Lindup\\'s falsetto frequently used for harmonies and choruses while King\\'s deep tenor led the verses (although Lindup would also sing entire songs on his own). The Gould brothers generally wrote lyrics while King, Badarou, and Lindup concentrated on Level 42\\'s music.\\n\\nThe Elite Records single \"Love Meeting Love\" brought the band to the attention of Polydor Records, with whom they signed their second recording contract. In 1981, they released their first Polydor single, \"Love Games\", which became a Top 40 hit. They then cut their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, which was an immediate success throughout Europe.\\n\\nThe band quickly established themselves as concert favorites on the budding British and European jazz-funk scene, taking advantage of the musical expertise and performance skills of all four members.[citation needed] Polydor capitalized on the band\\'s success by releasing a second album, The Early Tapes later in the same year. This was a compilation of material from the Elite Records period (and is also known by an alternate name, Strategy).\\n\\nIn 1982, Level 42 released their third album The Pursuit of Accidents. This was a further development of the Level 42 formula, maintaining their instrumental jazz-funk skills and styling but also experimenting further with pop songs. Both of the singles from the album — \"Weave Your Spell\" and \"The Chinese Way\" — charted. The latter, in particular, raised high in the charts and gained the band a much wider audience than before.\\n\\n1983–1985: Moving towards pop (Standing in the Light and True Colours):\\nA fourth album, Standing in the Light, was released in 1983. Produced by Larry Dunn and Verdine White (of Earth, Wind & Fire), this album began a new era for the band, being less experimental and less jazzy than previous releases. It provided them with their first UK Top Ten hit, \"The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\". Notably, the album featured no instrumental tracks, with the band now focusing heavily on songs. (The band would not release another instrumental on an album until 1988\\'s Staring at the Sun).\\n\\nThe 1984 album True Colours continued the band\\'s development away from primarily jazz-funk based music, switching between funk, power pop, mid-tempo rock, and moody ballads. It yielded the singles \"The Chant Has Begun\" and \"Hot Water\". The latter was a Top 20 hit in Britain and a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands where the band became popular (the song reached also No. 7 in Belgium). During the same year, Mark King released his first solo album Influences on which he played the majority of the instruments (with a guest appearance by Aswad\\'s Drummie Zeb, and with Lindup guesting on additional keyboards).\\n\\nLevel 42 became known for their power as a live band (as showcased on the 1985 double live album A Physical Presence). For live gigs the band added saxophonist Krys Mach, who toured with the group from 1984 to 1988 and contributed to some album recordings.\\n\\n1985–1987: Worldwide fame (World Machine and Running in the Family) and split of the original line-up\\nBy this time, the band was well established in their mainstream pop/rock sound, as evidenced on their next studio album, World Machine, released later in 1985. King\\'s dextrous bass playing and Lindup and Badarou\\'s chugging keyboards acted as templates for pop songs such as \"Something About You\" and \"Leaving Me Now\", which were both UK Top 20 hits (Top 40 hits in the Netherlands).\\n\\nSignificantly, \"Something About You\" was also their first (and only) US Top 10 the following year; also reaching the Top 5 in Canada and the Top 20 in Italy and New Zealand. \"Leaving Me Now\" was the second hit from this album, peaking at No. 15 in the United Kingdom but proving less successful in Europe. Elements of Level 42\\'s roots could still be found in the funky \"Coup d\\'État\" and \"Dream Crazy\" on the UK version of the album, as well as a long instrumental track named \"Hell,\" which was also recorded during the World Machine sessions (This last track did not see the light of day until the early 2000s as an MP3 download on the original Napster).\\n\\nWorld Machine gained positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic journalist William Cooper, in a retrospective review, describing it as \"one of the finest pop albums of the mid-\\'80s.\" During the recording of the album, the first major tensions between Phil Gould and Mark King began to surface over musical direction, production, and their relationship. This clashing led to Gould leaving the band for a week. Allan Holdsworth\\'s drummer Gary Husband was lined up as a potential replacement, but Gould and King\\'s dispute was subsequently patched up and the group went on to enjoy their most successful year to date.\\n\\nReleased in early 1986 (and initially recorded to keep up the band\\'s European chart momentum while the band was busy touring the United States), \"Lessons in Love\" was an international hit and became Level 42\\'s biggest selling single.[citation needed] It gave the band their first number one in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and South Africa, increasing the band\\'s popularity considerably. It also placed at No. 2 in Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, No. 3 in the UK and Ireland, No. 4 in Austria, No. 10 in Norway, No. 12 in the US in 1987, No. 18 in New Zealand, and No. 22 in France).\\n\\n\"Lessons in Love\" became the lead single on 1987\\'s Running in the Family album, recorded to capitalize on the impact. With the band now at the peak of their success, the album added further gloss to Level 42\\'s polished pop sound (despite adding to Phil Gould\\'s disquiet). Further singles from the album continued and built on the band\\'s existing profile: \"To Be With You Again\" (No. 6 in the Netherlands and Ireland), the ballad \"It\\'s Over\" (No. 3 in Ireland and No. 7 in the Netherlands) and Running In The Family\\'s title track (No. 1 in Denmark, No. 3 in the Netherlands, No. 4 in Ireland, No. 5 in Switzerland, No. 7 in Norway and No. 9 in New Zealand). The album itself was a major international success, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries.\\n\\nBy now a leading British pop band, Level 42 played at the Prince\\'s Trust concert in June 1987, with Eric Clapton standing in on lead guitar for a performance of \"Running in the Family\". King and Lindup also performed with artists including Ben E. King on \"Stand By Me\" and George Harrison and Ringo Starr on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\\n\\nDespite the success, Level 42 was on the brink of splitting up. Although Phil Gould was the most visibly dissatisfied member, Boon Gould was the first to leave, departing in late 1987, following a support slot on a Madonna tour. The quietest member of the band, Boon surprised both King and Lindup with his sudden departure. However, he had been suffering from nervous exhaustion and wanted to leave the lifestyle of a constantly touring musician to settle down and spend more time with his wife and children. Boon\\'s relationship with the band remained amicable and, although he would not return to Level 42 as a performing or recording member, he continued to write lyrics for the band following his departure. Paul Gendler (an experienced session player who had previously been the guitarist for Modern Romance) temporarily replaced him for a six-week headlining tour and further support slots with Tina Turner.\\n\\nIn December 1987, midway through the tour, Phil Gould left Level 42 permanently. Like his brother, he was suffering from exhaustion, but his relationship with King had broken down once again and they now found it difficult to work together. Phil was also reportedly dissatisfied with the band\\'s direction in terms of their newer \"pop\" sound, and King and Lindup failed to convince him to stay. To complete the tour dates, the band hired Prefab Sprout drummer Neil Conti to fill in.\\n\\n1988–1989: The second line-up (Staring at the Sun):\\nFollowing the tour, Level 42 recruited Gary Husband as the band\\'s new full-time drummer. He in turn recommended Steve Topping as a replacement guitarist. However, Topping and King\\'s personalities clashed and Topping eventually left the band in early 1988 after initial writing and rehearsing sessions in Dublin. Most of the next Level 42 album, Staring at the Sun, was recorded without a permanent guitarist. Rhythm guitar on the studio recordings was handled either by the band\\'s old friend Dominic Miller or by an uncredited Mark King. In April 1988, towards the end of the sessions, the band recruited lead guitarist Alan Murphy (a session guitarist who had worked extensively with Kate Bush and had been a member of Go West).\\n\\nStaring at the Sun was released in 1988, reaching number 2 in the UK and the top ten in several European charts. It included the hit single \"Heaven in My Hands\" (number 12 in the UK and the top twenty in the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland). Boon Gould had co-written many of the tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou, while Gary Husband was credited with his first co-write with King on \"Tracie\" (a tribute to King\\'s childhood sweetheart). To promote the album, Level 42 embarked on a four-month European tour, culminating in six sell-out nights at Wembley Arena. These latter dates were recorded for what would become the band\\'s second live album, Live At Wembley (eventually released in 1996).\\n\\nAlthough the band seemed to have maintained their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they were about to be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something that he may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy\\'s reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.\\n\\nDevastated, Level 42 took a year off to regroup and rethink. To cover the gap and to fulfill the band\\'s contract with Polydor Records, Level Best (a greatest hits compilation) was released at the end of 1989; also marking a decade since the band\\'s beginnings. During the break, Mike Lindup also recorded and released his debut solo album, Changes (featuring Dominic Miller, Pino Palladino on bass and Manu Katché on drums).\\n\\n1990–1992: Third and fourth lineups – Guaranteed album, Allan Holdsworth and Jakko Jakszyk:\\nThe band signed a new contract with RCA Records in 1990, for whom they produced their next album, Guaranteed. Although Dominic Miller once again handled most of the rhythm guitar work, Gary Husband asked Allan Holdsworth to provide some guitar work (notably on \"A Kinder Eye\"). As well as drumming, Husband also played keyboards and increased his songwriting role, co-writing many tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou. The album features the only track entirely written by Husband – \"If You Were Mine\" – that also featured on the \"Guaranteed\" single release. Mark King also collaborated with lyricists Drew Barfield and George Green to expand the songwriting. Guaranteed was well received by American music critics. However, the album did not get good reviews in the UK (despite reaching No. 3 in the UK charts while the title track reached No. 17 in the singles charts) and was ultimately less commercially successful than previous efforts.\\n\\nIn December 1990, Level 42 returned to play a record run of concerts at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in part fulfilling booking obligations preceding the band\\'s recent hiatus. The concerts featured Allan Holdsworth (whom Husband had asked to play as a favor while the band searched for a permanent guitarist) plus four additional players: Lyndon Connah (ex-64 Spoons) on additional keyboards and percussion and sharing backing vocals with Annie McCaig, plus the horn section from the Guaranteed album (John Thirkell and Gary Barnacle).\\n\\nAfter the recording of Guaranteed and a weeklong promotional tour, Level 42 needed a permanent guitarist. Mark King assumed (erroneously) that Allan Holdsworth would not be interested in taking the position. Instead, the band recruited well-respected art-pop guitarist, session player, and sometime solo artist Jakko Jakszyk: the former frontman for 64 Spoons, he had also collaborated with Tom Robinson, Sam Brown, and Stewart/Gaskin among others. Although he did not play on Guaranteed, Jakszyk appeared on the album\\'s cover photo and took part in promotional duties and the tour for the album, as well as playing on two B-sides from this era (\"At This Great Distance\" and \"As Years Go By\").\\n\\nUnlike Husband, Jakszyk never became a full legal member of the band (apparently due to \"record company politics\"). However, following the end of promotion for Guaranteed, the King-Lindup-Husband-Jakszyk line began writing and recording new material together, with at least two songs (\"Fire\" and \"Free Your Soul\") completed. Following the next development in the band\\'s history, this work was shelved and remains unreleased.\\n\\n1993–1994: Fifth and sixth lineups (including the brief return of Phil Gould), Forever Now and disbandment\\nIn early 1993, Gary Husband left Level 42, leading to the return of group founder member Phil Gould as Level 42\\'s drummer (and principal lyricist) for 1994\\'s Forever Now album. Further changes to the band were evident in that Jakko Jakszyk did not play on the album: the American session guitarist Danny Blume (erroneously credited as “Danny Bloom” performed all guitars.\\n\\nAlthough Forever Now was a critical success, the reunion of Gould and the group was short-lived. When Level 42 began to promote the new album (with Jakszyk returning to the live band for concerts and TV appearances), Gould played only one promotional gig and did not go on the road for the Forever Now tour. Jakszyk’s friend and frequent collaborator Gavin Harrison (who later played drums for both Porcupine Tree and King Crimson) replaced him as a live drummer.\\n\\nIt was announced halfway through the Forever Now tour, on the day of the Manchester Apollo gig, which the band would be disbanding permanently following their concert commitments. Level 42 played their last gig at the Albert Hall in London on 14 October 1994. According to Jakszyk, the band recorded tapes for a live album during the final 1994 shows at the Albert Hall and the Brighton Dome which \"sounded fantastic\", but the album was never released.\\n\\n1996–2000: Mark King\\'s solo years:\\nIn 1996, Mark King signed to Virgin Records and released a solo single \"Bitter Moon\" (with Lyndon Connah playing keyboards). This was followed up by his second solo album One Man, featuring lyrics by Boon Gould. The album was not a big commercial success. \\n\\nKing later toured as a solo act, playing his new compositions and some Level 42 favorites. In 1999, he played some shows at the Jazz Cafe in London under the name of \"The Mark King Group\" with a band including Husband, Jakszyk, and Jakszyk\\'s fellow former 64 Spoons colleague Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Jakszyk left the band after the Jazz Cafe shows, to be replaced on guitar by Nathan King (Mark King\\'s younger brother). King continued to tour with this band, now renamed \"Grupo Mark King\", over the next couple of years, augmenting the line-up with saxophone player Sean Freeman.\\n\\nIn August 1999, three-quarters of the original Level 42 line-up reunited for a private show. Phil Gould invited some musician friends to play at a party, including his brother Boon and Mike Lindup. In 2001, Mark King, Mike Lindup, and Phil Gould played together at Lindup\\'s wedding for the first time in ten years.[citation needed]\\n\\n2001–2005: Return of Level 42 (seventh lineup):\\nAlthough Mark King released two solo albums, his previous band\\'s music proved to be persistently popular and he found that he was playing more and more old Level 42 tracks at live shows.\\n\\nIn late 2001, King came to a business agreement with Mike Lindup and bought the rights to the name Level 42. Although Lindup agreed to play on future albums, he did not want to tour.[citation needed] King announced the return of Level 42 with a new line-up which also happened to be the musicians from his current live band: himself, Husband, Connah, Freeman, and Nathan King. On 12 July 2002, the first official Level 42 concert for six years was played at The Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. While not recording any new material, for the next few years the band settled into a regular pattern of touring and playing old hits.\\n\\nOn 13 February 2005, there was a brief one-night reunion with Mike Lindup (who joined the band onstage for a date at The Forum in London)[citation needed] and over the year, there was a burst of reissue activity. Two Rockpalast shows from 1983 and 1984 were released on DVD, followed by two CD releases: The River Sessions (a live show from 1983 recorded in Scotland) and a new compilation called The Ultimate Collection II. The latter included a new song called \"Genius Of Love\", which was a Level 42 tribute/collaboration by the Italian-American dance producer Hardage, featuring Mark King on vocals and incorporating a sample of the Level 42 track \"I Want Eyes\".\\n\\n2006–2012: Retroglide and further tours and lineup changes:\\nIn February 2006, after twelve years without releasing a new studio album, Level 42 announced the release of Retroglide. While billed as a band album, it was chiefly recorded and produced by King at his home studio, with Gary Husband, Lyndon Connah, Sean Freeman, and Nathan King all contributing.\\n\\nRetroglide also featured input from two previous Level 42 members. Erstwhile guitarist Boon Gould provided the album\\'s lyrics (as well as contributing a guitar solo on \"Ship\") and Mike Lindup, who added prominent keyboard parts and vocals to many tracks, effectively expanded the band to a six-piece via extensive guest performances. Although Phil Gould was uncredited on the album, the track \"Ship\" is the first song since 1986 worked on by all four original members, as Phil originally arranged the track with his brother Boon. However, Retroglide was also the first Level 42 album not to feature any contributions from Wally Badarou.\\n\\nIn May 2006, Level 42 announced that Mike Lindup would return full-time to replace Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Retroglide was promoted via a supporting tour throughout the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and several other European countries during October 2006. On 26 August 2007, Level 42 played an outdoor gig at the Arundel Festival in West Sussex: the band\\'s only UK show of the year. In 2008, Level 42 played a twenty-date UK tour.\\n\\nIn 2010, Husband stepped down as Level 42\\'s drummer for the second time, due to prior commitments with John McLaughlin. Pete Ray Biggin replaced Husband. In 2012, Level 42 toured the UK and mainland Europe, in celebration of the 25th anniversary since the release of Running in the Family, by playing the whole album, with a whole array of other hits. Also included in the shows was an acoustic set, with Mike Lindup playing the accordion. In October 2012, on Mark King\\'s birthday during a gig in Bristol, Boon Gould joined the band on stage.\\n\\n2013–present: \"Sirens\" EP series and re-engagement with contemporary dance-pop:\\nOn 20 and 21 September 2013, Level 42 (joined by an expanded brass section), performed three new songs at London\\'s Indigo O2 Arena – \"Where\\'s Yo\\' Head At\", \"Too Much Time\", and \"Sirens\". All of these appeared on the band\\'s first new release for seven years, the six-song studio EP \"Sirens\" (released on 31 October 2013, and the first output from the band\\'s new self-owned label Level 42 Records). Mixed by the American DJ John Morales, the EP also contained \"Mind on You\", \"My Independence Day\" and \"Build Myself a Rocket\" (with King\\'s daughter Marlee providing the backing vocals on the last of these tracks). Musically, it built on the production approach of Retroglide while allying the band with contemporary developments in R&B and dance electronic.\\n\\nOn 3 December 2013, the band announced \\'The Sirens Tour\\' – a 30-date tour, starting in October 2014 and taking in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. In the summer of 2014, the band performed at several festivals across Europe including headline performances at Let\\'s Rock Bristol and Rochester Castle. They also played at Rewind festivals. At a performance in Bournemouth, ex-drummer Gary Husband returned due to Pete Ray Biggin being unavailable.\\n\\nIn 2015, the band appeared at a number of the UK and European festivals headlining at \\'Let\\'s Rock the Moor\\' and \\'Carfest\\' concerts. They also played two nights at the Indigo2 in London where the band once again featured a larger brass section consisting of Dan Carpenter (trumpet) and Nicol Thomson (trombone) as well as regular saxophonist Sean Freeman.\\n\\nIn 2016, Level 42 performed at several festivals across the UK and Europe as well as in Curaçao, Chile, and Argentina before embarking on the UK, Netherlands, and Scandinavian tour to promote the \"Sirens II\" EP. On 1 May 2019, it was announced that Boon Gould had been found dead at his home in Dorset. He was 64. On 4 July 2019, Level 42 made a rare North American incursion, being the band to perform the first concert to launch the week-long «Festival d\\'été de Québec» (Quebec City Summer Festival). A rare treat for North American fans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Level+42\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography_es": "Level 42 es un una banda musical de pop británica y de estilo funk. El grupo tuvo gran éxito en el Reino Unido y en el resto del mundo durante los 80. La banda ganó fama por la calidad de músicos como Mark King, cuya técnica magistral de tocar el bajo fue un trampolín para muchos éxitos de la banda.\nLos miembros fundadores de la banda fueron Mark King (Vocalista), Mike Lindup (Teclado y vocalista), Boon Gould (Guitarra) y el músico Philip Gould (batería). El teclista de estudio Wally Badarou contribuyó a muchos de sus primeros éxitos, y es considerado por muchos el quinto miembro del grupo, aunque nunca se unió oficialmente. Otros miembros a tiempo completo que han colaborado a lo largo de los años fueron Alan Murphy, Gary Husband, Jakko Jakszyk, Nathan King, Lyndon Connah y Sean Freeman.\nLa banda aún realiza conciertos en directo (con Mark King a la cabeza y con variaciones en su formación original), y su nuevo álbum, Retroglide, está previsto que salga el 18 de septiembre de 2006.\nLevel 42 se formó en 1979 como una banda que fusionaba el jazz y el funk. En principio la banda firmó con una pequeña discográfica indepediente, Elite Records. Poco después lanzaron el sencillo \"Love meeting Love\" en Elite Records, lo cual llamó la atención de Polydor Records y firmaron con ésta. Uno de los colaboradores de su nueva andadura, el teclista Wally Badarou, más tarde se convertiría por años en el co-productor de Level 42 y que Mark King llamaría el \"quinto miembro\" de la banda, pese a que tenía otros compromisos que le impedía ir de gira.\nEn 1981 sacaron \"Love Games\", un éxito que coparon las listas de ventas. Poco después lanzaron el álbum del mismo nombre. Fue todo un éxito en toda Europa.\nAl año siguiente, se hizo un segundo álbum The Pursuit of Accidents, y sencillos del álbum: el primero \"Weave Your Spell\" y luego salió \"The Chinese Way\", el último en particular llegó muy lejos en las listas de ventas, ganando en audiencia y en éxito. Entre tanto, Polydor lanzó The Early Tapes, grabado en tiempos en que la banda firmó con el sello discográfico Elite. Un cuarto álbum Standing in the Light colocó entre los diez primeros de las listas el éxito \"The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\" en Reino Unido en 1983. Grabado con los miembros de Earth, Wind and Fire, este álbum abrió una nueva era en la banda, menos experimental y de estilo jazz que sus anteriores lanzamientos. No había piezas enteramente instrumentales en este álbum y ninguno de los siguientes álbumes hasta el Staring at the Sun en 1988.\nEl cuarteto prosiguió con el álbum True Colours en 1984, el cual mezclaba estilos funk, pop, midtempo rock y baladas melosas. Dio paso a los sencillos \"The Chant Has Begun\" y \"Hot Water\". En ese mismo año, Mark King estaba inmerso en un proyecto en solitario: Influences. Además, el grupos fue aclamado también por sus poderosos directos en el escenario (como el directo grabado en álbum Physical Presence).\nEl siguiente álbum hecho en estudio fue World Machine, que salió en 1985. Los sencillos de éste, \"Something About You\" y \"Leaving Me Now\" fueron éxitos entre los diez primeros en las listas, seguido por otro, \"Lessons in Love\", a principios de 1986. Por entonces, la banda se alejó de su estilo jazz-funk y su tendencia fue el sonido pop. Elementos de las raíces de Level 42 todavía podían apreciarse en el funky \"Coup d'Etat\" y \"Dream Crazy\" en la versión británica del álbum, así como una larga pista instrumental llamada \"Hell\". Esta última pista del álbum no vio la luz del día hasta principios de 2000 como una descarga de MP3 en el antiguo Napster.\nEl álbum Running in the Family, 1987, se convirtió en su disco más vendido, y sentó las bases del estilo musical pop, con el bajo de Mark King, Lindup y los sonidos del teclista Badarou sirviendo como plantillas, para dar canciones pop acertadas como \"Lessons in Love\", la balada \"It's Over\" y el título del álbum.\nTanto Philip como Boon dejaron el grupo, descontentos por la creciente tendencia hacia la musica pop y agotados por las giras. Entonces, King contrató a Gary Husband y a Steve Topping para reemplazarlos. Husband recomendó a Topping, pero éste no se entendió bien con King debido a diferencias de personalidad. El guitarrista Alan Murphy se unió al grupo, ex-integrante de la banda Go West. También había tenido el guitarrista de estudio de Kate Bush. El nuevo álbum de Level 42 Staring at the Sun salió a la venta en 1988. Al año siguiente, Alan murió a causa de una efermedad relacionada con el SIDA y la banda desapareció por un tiempo. Entonces, se sacó al mercado Level Best, un recopilation con los grandes éxitos. En diciembre de 1990, la banda tocó unos conciertos en el Hammersmith Odeon de Londres, el cual ya había sido reservado dos años antes. Estos conciertos los caracterizaban Lyndon Connah en teclados y voces y Allan Holdsworth en la guitarra. En este año, Mike Lindup sacó también su álbum debut en solitario Changes.\nDurante principios de los 1990s, el grupo intentó extraer más de su recientes influencias musicales, como las de Mahavishnu Orchestra, pidiendo al músico Allan Holdsworth para aportar unos toques sorprendentes de guitarra para el álbum Guaranteed (sobre todo a \"A Kinder Eye\"). Pese a la buena acogida, especialmente de los críticos de la música de Estados Unidos, muchos de sus incondicionales del jazz-funk no les gustó su estilo rock-pop. El álbum no se vendió tan bien como se esperaba a pesar de haber realizado musicalmente el trabajo más sofisticado y elaborado por Level 42 hasta la fecha.\nSin embargo, la banda continuaba teniendo un potente directo en los escenarios, con miembros como Annie McCaig, que también hacía de voz de fondo en el álbum Guaranteed, y el dúo formado por el saxofonista Gary Barnacle y el trompetista John Thirkell, de los The Hen Pecked Horns. Además, Barnacle tocó en varios álbumes de estudio de los Level 42. Barnacle había sido antecedido como saxofonista de la gira por Krys Mach, quien también grabó con Level 42 y estuvo de gira con el grupo de 1984 a 1988.\nDespués de grabar Guaranteed y de una gira promocional de una semana, Holdworth, resuelto a no tocar más la guitarra, dejó la banda y fue reemplazado por Jakko Jakszyk. Aunque no en la grabación, Jakszyk figuró en la foto del álbum; también formó parte de promociones y en la gira para el álbum. Fue protagonista en canciones como \"At the Great Distance\" y \"As Years Go By\". Trabajos de estudio con Level 42 vinieron en forma de dos pistas (\"Fire\" y \"Free Your Soul\") que se incluyeron en los álbumes Guaranteed y Forever now respectivamente.\nEl álbum Forever Now de 1994, marcó el retorno de Philip Gould como percusionista de estudio y principal compositor de letras. En el álbum se vio que el grupo se acercaba a sus raíces Rythm&Blues-jazz, sobre todo en la balada \"Romance\", en la canción con influencias de acid-jazz \"Sunbed Song\" y la dance-pop \"Learn to Say No\".\nCon un álbum más que se requería como parte del acuerdo que tenía la banda con RCA Records, los incondicionales vieron un futuro prometedor para la banda, especialmente con el retorno Philip Gould y los halagos de la crítica musical con Forever Now; sin embargo, la fructífera reunión duró muy poco. Phil Gould, consternado por la ineptitud de la compañía discográfica, no continuó el camino emprendido con la banda y su gira Forever Now; anunció su retirada en medio de la gira. Esto pudo significar el fin de la banda.\nEn 1998, Mark King lanzó su segundo álbum en solitario One Man con letras de Boon Gould. En 1999, King volvió con nuevas composiciones y algunas de Level 42. A últimos 2001 llegó a un acuerdo con Mike Lindup y para renombrar su banda como 'Level 42'. Generalmente, este nuevo elenco estaba formado por King, el batería Gary Husband, Nathan King en guitarras y voces, Lyndon Connah en los teclados y voces y Sean Freeman en el saxofón y voces. Nuevas noticias en la web Level42.com (Mayo de 2006) hablan de un cambio de Lyndon por Mike Lindup en los teclados.\nEn agosto de 2000, se reunieron tres cuartas partes del elenco de Level 42 para un concierto privado. Philip Gould invitó a algunos amigos músicos para tocar en una fiesta, incluyendo a su hermano Boon y Mike Lindup. Dos años más tarde, King, Lindup y Philip Gould tocaron juntos (en la boda de Lindup) por primera vez en diez años. Esto les llevó a un intento de juntarse de nuevo como en sus inicios con Baradou. Sin embargo, la formación duró poco y viejas rencillas comenzaron a resurgir. El catalizador fue King en su empeño del control sobre la banda.\nAunque el grupo decidió no reagruparse, Boon Gould y Mike Lindup contribuyeron en su nuevo álbum, dirigido por King, pero con contribuciones de muchos integrantes de la banda en distintas épocas. El núevo álbum, Retroglide, previsto el lanzamiento para el 11 de septiembre de 2006, se anunció en febrero de 2006 con una gira por el Reino Unido, Holanda, Alemania y otros países europeos en octubre/noviembre de 2006 con Mike Lindup como invitado especial.\nEl nombre originario de la banda ha sido descrito en ocasiones como una inspiración de señal de un ascensor de un edificio alto de EE.UU.; El último piso del apacarmiento de coches más grande del mundo, en Japón; el piso en el cual el personaje de Jonathan Pryce reside en la película Brazil (que salió mucho después de que la banda ganara reconocimiento internacional); o la alargada edificación de la Ciudad de Londres llamada Tower 42 (conocida también por NatWest Tower).\nKing y Boon Gould decidieron que la banda debería llamarse simplemente por un número, y pensaron en el '88', el número de autobús que utilizaban para ir al estudio de grabación. No obstante, Lindup y Philip Gould vieron un póster de una banda llamada 'Rocket 88', así que abandonaron la idea (aunque '88' fue usado más tarde como el nombre de una canción). Entonces, se sugirió el '42' como nombre de la banda (número sacado de una novela de ciencia-ficción de Douglas Adams llamada The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). Se presume que el fallecido productor Andy Sojka propuso este nombre por haber leído esta novela también. En consecuencia, Se sabe que el uso del número '42' vino o de King o de Boon Gould o de Sojka. La palabra 'Level' se presume que pudo ser o de un abogado de Sojka o de un abogado de John Gould (el tercer hermano y mánager de la banda).\nOtros nombres considerados para el nombre de la banda fueron 'Powerline' y 'Kick in the head'. 'Powerline' se rechazó y se dio a otro de los grupos de Sojka, y fue en una grabación promocional donde las palabras 'Level 42' aparecieron por primera vez. Una pista en la cara B la llamaron 'Sandstorm' (una pista que querían llamar 'Kick in the head'). La cara A contenía una pista con el nombre de 'Powerline'.\n'Kick in the head' fue utilizado en su álbum 'True Colours', incluido en la canción 'A Floating Life'.\nOtras canciones instrumentales fueron bautizadas con números: '43', '88' y 'Forty-two'.",

      "bio_content": "Level 42 is an English jazz-funk band formed on the Isle of Wight in 1979. They had the several UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nTheir highest-charting single in the UK was \"Lessons in Love\", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, \"Something About You\", was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. After much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42's commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001. \n\nHistory\n1979–1980: Prehistory and formation:\nMark King and the Gould brothers (Phil and Rowland, the latter was generally known by his nickname Boon) were all brought up on the Isle of Wight and played together in various bands during their teenage years. Phil Gould went on to study at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he met keyboard player Mike Lindup in a percussion course. Both musicians found that they had the same feelings about musical heroes: Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett, and Jan Hammer.\n\nBy 1979, Phil Gould and Mark King were both based in London and became involved in Robin Scott's pop project M. While working with M, they became acquainted with Afro-French keyboard player Wally Badarou, who played synthesizer on M's US number-one single \"Pop Muzik\". In late 1979, Phil Gould introduced Mark King and Mike Lindup to each other, and all of them began playing together in loose rehearsal sessions, developing their jazz-funk fusion style. The developing band's original guitarist was Dominic Miller (later to find fame playing with Sting), but he was replaced by Boon Gould on the latter's return from working in the United States.\n\nInitially, instrumental roles were flexible, with Boon Gould also playing bass guitar and saxophone and Lindup doubling on keyboards and drums. Mark King was primarily a drummer (although he also played guitar) but had recently sold his drum kit to pay for transport back to the UK after an ill-fated European venture. With Phil Gould and Boon Gould established (respectively) as the most accomplished drummer and guitarist in the quartet, King opted to learn bass guitar instead. At the time, King was working in a London music store. A notably flexible musician and quick learner, he had observed visiting American funk players demonstrating the thumb-slap bass guitar technique and developed his take on the style in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe developing band (at this point, entirely an instrumental act) took the name Level 42 and settled on a working line-up of King (bass guitar, percussion), Lindup (keyboards, percussion), Boon Gould (guitar, saxophone), and Phil Gould (drums). The name of the band is a reference to the novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, in which \"42\" is the answer to \"the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\" Having maintained their links with Wally Badarou, Phil Gould, and Mark King invited him to work with Level 42. Although he never formally joined the band, Badarou would become a fifth member in all but name: co-writing songs, playing keyboards and synthesizers in the studio, and co-producing the records.\n\n1980–1983: Early albums (Level 42, The Early Tapes, The Pursuit of Accidents)\nAfter they were seen, jamming together, Level 42 were invited to sign to Elite Records (a small independent label) in 1980. They were also encouraged to branch out into vocal music. Having considered recruiting a singer, the band eventually settled on giving King and Lindup the vocal role. The two men developed a complementary style, with Lindup's falsetto frequently used for harmonies and choruses while King's deep tenor led the verses (although Lindup would also sing entire songs on his own). The Gould brothers generally wrote lyrics while King, Badarou, and Lindup concentrated on Level 42's music.\n\nThe Elite Records single \"Love Meeting Love\" brought the band to the attention of Polydor Records, with whom they signed their second recording contract. In 1981, they released their first Polydor single, \"Love Games\", which became a Top 40 hit. They then cut their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, which was an immediate success throughout Europe.\n\nThe band quickly established themselves as concert favorites on the budding British and European jazz-funk scene, taking advantage of the musical expertise and performance skills of all four members.[citation needed] Polydor capitalized on the band's success by releasing a second album, The Early Tapes later in the same year. This was a compilation of material from the Elite Records period (and is also known by an alternate name, Strategy).\n\nIn 1982, Level 42 released their third album The Pursuit of Accidents. This was a further development of the Level 42 formula, maintaining their instrumental jazz-funk skills and styling but also experimenting further with pop songs. Both of the singles from the album — \"Weave Your Spell\" and \"The Chinese Way\" — charted. The latter, in particular, raised high in the charts and gained the band a much wider audience than before.\n\n1983–1985: Moving towards pop (Standing in the Light and True Colours):\nA fourth album, Standing in the Light, was released in 1983. Produced by Larry Dunn and Verdine White (of Earth, Wind & Fire), this album began a new era for the band, being less experimental and less jazzy than previous releases. It provided them with their first UK Top Ten hit, \"The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\". Notably, the album featured no instrumental tracks, with the band now focusing heavily on songs. (The band would not release another instrumental on an album until 1988's Staring at the Sun).\n\nThe 1984 album True Colours continued the band's development away from primarily jazz-funk based music, switching between funk, power pop, mid-tempo rock, and moody ballads. It yielded the singles \"The Chant Has Begun\" and \"Hot Water\". The latter was a Top 20 hit in Britain and a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands where the band became popular (the song reached also No. 7 in Belgium). During the same year, Mark King released his first solo album Influences on which he played the majority of the instruments (with a guest appearance by Aswad's Drummie Zeb, and with Lindup guesting on additional keyboards).\n\nLevel 42 became known for their power as a live band (as showcased on the 1985 double live album A Physical Presence). For live gigs the band added saxophonist Krys Mach, who toured with the group from 1984 to 1988 and contributed to some album recordings.\n\n1985–1987: Worldwide fame (World Machine and Running in the Family) and split of the original line-up\nBy this time, the band was well established in their mainstream pop/rock sound, as evidenced on their next studio album, World Machine, released later in 1985. King's dextrous bass playing and Lindup and Badarou's chugging keyboards acted as templates for pop songs such as \"Something About You\" and \"Leaving Me Now\", which were both UK Top 20 hits (Top 40 hits in the Netherlands).\n\nSignificantly, \"Something About You\" was also their first (and only) US Top 10 the following year; also reaching the Top 5 in Canada and the Top 20 in Italy and New Zealand. \"Leaving Me Now\" was the second hit from this album, peaking at No. 15 in the United Kingdom but proving less successful in Europe. Elements of Level 42's roots could still be found in the funky \"Coup d'État\" and \"Dream Crazy\" on the UK version of the album, as well as a long instrumental track named \"Hell,\" which was also recorded during the World Machine sessions (This last track did not see the light of day until the early 2000s as an MP3 download on the original Napster).\n\nWorld Machine gained positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic journalist William Cooper, in a retrospective review, describing it as \"one of the finest pop albums of the mid-'80s.\" During the recording of the album, the first major tensions between Phil Gould and Mark King began to surface over musical direction, production, and their relationship. This clashing led to Gould leaving the band for a week. Allan Holdsworth's drummer Gary Husband was lined up as a potential replacement, but Gould and King's dispute was subsequently patched up and the group went on to enjoy their most successful year to date.\n\nReleased in early 1986 (and initially recorded to keep up the band's European chart momentum while the band was busy touring the United States), \"Lessons in Love\" was an international hit and became Level 42's biggest selling single.[citation needed] It gave the band their first number one in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and South Africa, increasing the band's popularity considerably. It also placed at No. 2 in Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, No. 3 in the UK and Ireland, No. 4 in Austria, No. 10 in Norway, No. 12 in the US in 1987, No. 18 in New Zealand, and No. 22 in France).\n\n\"Lessons in Love\" became the lead single on 1987's Running in the Family album, recorded to capitalize on the impact. With the band now at the peak of their success, the album added further gloss to Level 42's polished pop sound (despite adding to Phil Gould's disquiet). Further singles from the album continued and built on the band's existing profile: \"To Be With You Again\" (No. 6 in the Netherlands and Ireland), the ballad \"It's Over\" (No. 3 in Ireland and No. 7 in the Netherlands) and Running In The Family's title track (No. 1 in Denmark, No. 3 in the Netherlands, No. 4 in Ireland, No. 5 in Switzerland, No. 7 in Norway and No. 9 in New Zealand). The album itself was a major international success, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries.\n\nBy now a leading British pop band, Level 42 played at the Prince's Trust concert in June 1987, with Eric Clapton standing in on lead guitar for a performance of \"Running in the Family\". King and Lindup also performed with artists including Ben E. King on \"Stand By Me\" and George Harrison and Ringo Starr on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\nDespite the success, Level 42 was on the brink of splitting up. Although Phil Gould was the most visibly dissatisfied member, Boon Gould was the first to leave, departing in late 1987, following a support slot on a Madonna tour. The quietest member of the band, Boon surprised both King and Lindup with his sudden departure. However, he had been suffering from nervous exhaustion and wanted to leave the lifestyle of a constantly touring musician to settle down and spend more time with his wife and children. Boon's relationship with the band remained amicable and, although he would not return to Level 42 as a performing or recording member, he continued to write lyrics for the band following his departure. Paul Gendler (an experienced session player who had previously been the guitarist for Modern Romance) temporarily replaced him for a six-week headlining tour and further support slots with Tina Turner.\n\nIn December 1987, midway through the tour, Phil Gould left Level 42 permanently. Like his brother, he was suffering from exhaustion, but his relationship with King had broken down once again and they now found it difficult to work together. Phil was also reportedly dissatisfied with the band's direction in terms of their newer \"pop\" sound, and King and Lindup failed to convince him to stay. To complete the tour dates, the band hired Prefab Sprout drummer Neil Conti to fill in.\n\n1988–1989: The second line-up (Staring at the Sun):\nFollowing the tour, Level 42 recruited Gary Husband as the band's new full-time drummer. He in turn recommended Steve Topping as a replacement guitarist. However, Topping and King's personalities clashed and Topping eventually left the band in early 1988 after initial writing and rehearsing sessions in Dublin. Most of the next Level 42 album, Staring at the Sun, was recorded without a permanent guitarist. Rhythm guitar on the studio recordings was handled either by the band's old friend Dominic Miller or by an uncredited Mark King. In April 1988, towards the end of the sessions, the band recruited lead guitarist Alan Murphy (a session guitarist who had worked extensively with Kate Bush and had been a member of Go West).\n\nStaring at the Sun was released in 1988, reaching number 2 in the UK and the top ten in several European charts. It included the hit single \"Heaven in My Hands\" (number 12 in the UK and the top twenty in the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland). Boon Gould had co-written many of the tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou, while Gary Husband was credited with his first co-write with King on \"Tracie\" (a tribute to King's childhood sweetheart). To promote the album, Level 42 embarked on a four-month European tour, culminating in six sell-out nights at Wembley Arena. These latter dates were recorded for what would become the band's second live album, Live At Wembley (eventually released in 1996).\n\nAlthough the band seemed to have maintained their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they were about to be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something that he may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy's reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.\n\nDevastated, Level 42 took a year off to regroup and rethink. To cover the gap and to fulfill the band's contract with Polydor Records, Level Best (a greatest hits compilation) was released at the end of 1989; also marking a decade since the band's beginnings. During the break, Mike Lindup also recorded and released his debut solo album, Changes (featuring Dominic Miller, Pino Palladino on bass and Manu Katché on drums).\n\n1990–1992: Third and fourth lineups – Guaranteed album, Allan Holdsworth and Jakko Jakszyk:\nThe band signed a new contract with RCA Records in 1990, for whom they produced their next album, Guaranteed. Although Dominic Miller once again handled most of the rhythm guitar work, Gary Husband asked Allan Holdsworth to provide some guitar work (notably on \"A Kinder Eye\"). As well as drumming, Husband also played keyboards and increased his songwriting role, co-writing many tracks with King, Lindup, and Badarou. The album features the only track entirely written by Husband – \"If You Were Mine\" – that also featured on the \"Guaranteed\" single release. Mark King also collaborated with lyricists Drew Barfield and George Green to expand the songwriting. Guaranteed was well received by American music critics. However, the album did not get good reviews in the UK (despite reaching No. 3 in the UK charts while the title track reached No. 17 in the singles charts) and was ultimately less commercially successful than previous efforts.\n\nIn December 1990, Level 42 returned to play a record run of concerts at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in part fulfilling booking obligations preceding the band's recent hiatus. The concerts featured Allan Holdsworth (whom Husband had asked to play as a favor while the band searched for a permanent guitarist) plus four additional players: Lyndon Connah (ex-64 Spoons) on additional keyboards and percussion and sharing backing vocals with Annie McCaig, plus the horn section from the Guaranteed album (John Thirkell and Gary Barnacle).\n\nAfter the recording of Guaranteed and a weeklong promotional tour, Level 42 needed a permanent guitarist. Mark King assumed (erroneously) that Allan Holdsworth would not be interested in taking the position. Instead, the band recruited well-respected art-pop guitarist, session player, and sometime solo artist Jakko Jakszyk: the former frontman for 64 Spoons, he had also collaborated with Tom Robinson, Sam Brown, and Stewart/Gaskin among others. Although he did not play on Guaranteed, Jakszyk appeared on the album's cover photo and took part in promotional duties and the tour for the album, as well as playing on two B-sides from this era (\"At This Great Distance\" and \"As Years Go By\").\n\nUnlike Husband, Jakszyk never became a full legal member of the band (apparently due to \"record company politics\"). However, following the end of promotion for Guaranteed, the King-Lindup-Husband-Jakszyk line began writing and recording new material together, with at least two songs (\"Fire\" and \"Free Your Soul\") completed. Following the next development in the band's history, this work was shelved and remains unreleased.\n\n1993–1994: Fifth and sixth lineups (including the brief return of Phil Gould), Forever Now and disbandment\nIn early 1993, Gary Husband left Level 42, leading to the return of group founder member Phil Gould as Level 42's drummer (and principal lyricist) for 1994's Forever Now album. Further changes to the band were evident in that Jakko Jakszyk did not play on the album: the American session guitarist Danny Blume (erroneously credited as “Danny Bloom” performed all guitars.\n\nAlthough Forever Now was a critical success, the reunion of Gould and the group was short-lived. When Level 42 began to promote the new album (with Jakszyk returning to the live band for concerts and TV appearances), Gould played only one promotional gig and did not go on the road for the Forever Now tour. Jakszyk’s friend and frequent collaborator Gavin Harrison (who later played drums for both Porcupine Tree and King Crimson) replaced him as a live drummer.\n\nIt was announced halfway through the Forever Now tour, on the day of the Manchester Apollo gig, which the band would be disbanding permanently following their concert commitments. Level 42 played their last gig at the Albert Hall in London on 14 October 1994. According to Jakszyk, the band recorded tapes for a live album during the final 1994 shows at the Albert Hall and the Brighton Dome which \"sounded fantastic\", but the album was never released.\n\n1996–2000: Mark King's solo years:\nIn 1996, Mark King signed to Virgin Records and released a solo single \"Bitter Moon\" (with Lyndon Connah playing keyboards). This was followed up by his second solo album One Man, featuring lyrics by Boon Gould. The album was not a big commercial success. \n\nKing later toured as a solo act, playing his new compositions and some Level 42 favorites. In 1999, he played some shows at the Jazz Cafe in London under the name of \"The Mark King Group\" with a band including Husband, Jakszyk, and Jakszyk's fellow former 64 Spoons colleague Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Jakszyk left the band after the Jazz Cafe shows, to be replaced on guitar by Nathan King (Mark King's younger brother). King continued to tour with this band, now renamed \"Grupo Mark King\", over the next couple of years, augmenting the line-up with saxophone player Sean Freeman.\n\nIn August 1999, three-quarters of the original Level 42 line-up reunited for a private show. Phil Gould invited some musician friends to play at a party, including his brother Boon and Mike Lindup. In 2001, Mark King, Mike Lindup, and Phil Gould played together at Lindup's wedding for the first time in ten years.[citation needed]\n\n2001–2005: Return of Level 42 (seventh lineup):\nAlthough Mark King released two solo albums, his previous band's music proved to be persistently popular and he found that he was playing more and more old Level 42 tracks at live shows.\n\nIn late 2001, King came to a business agreement with Mike Lindup and bought the rights to the name Level 42. Although Lindup agreed to play on future albums, he did not want to tour.[citation needed] King announced the return of Level 42 with a new line-up which also happened to be the musicians from his current live band: himself, Husband, Connah, Freeman, and Nathan King. On 12 July 2002, the first official Level 42 concert for six years was played at The Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. While not recording any new material, for the next few years the band settled into a regular pattern of touring and playing old hits.\n\nOn 13 February 2005, there was a brief one-night reunion with Mike Lindup (who joined the band onstage for a date at The Forum in London)[citation needed] and over the year, there was a burst of reissue activity. Two Rockpalast shows from 1983 and 1984 were released on DVD, followed by two CD releases: The River Sessions (a live show from 1983 recorded in Scotland) and a new compilation called The Ultimate Collection II. The latter included a new song called \"Genius Of Love\", which was a Level 42 tribute/collaboration by the Italian-American dance producer Hardage, featuring Mark King on vocals and incorporating a sample of the Level 42 track \"I Want Eyes\".\n\n2006–2012: Retroglide and further tours and lineup changes:\nIn February 2006, after twelve years without releasing a new studio album, Level 42 announced the release of Retroglide. While billed as a band album, it was chiefly recorded and produced by King at his home studio, with Gary Husband, Lyndon Connah, Sean Freeman, and Nathan King all contributing.\n\nRetroglide also featured input from two previous Level 42 members. Erstwhile guitarist Boon Gould provided the album's lyrics (as well as contributing a guitar solo on \"Ship\") and Mike Lindup, who added prominent keyboard parts and vocals to many tracks, effectively expanded the band to a six-piece via extensive guest performances. Although Phil Gould was uncredited on the album, the track \"Ship\" is the first song since 1986 worked on by all four original members, as Phil originally arranged the track with his brother Boon. However, Retroglide was also the first Level 42 album not to feature any contributions from Wally Badarou.\n\nIn May 2006, Level 42 announced that Mike Lindup would return full-time to replace Lyndon Connah on keyboards. Retroglide was promoted via a supporting tour throughout the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and several other European countries during October 2006. On 26 August 2007, Level 42 played an outdoor gig at the Arundel Festival in West Sussex: the band's only UK show of the year. In 2008, Level 42 played a twenty-date UK tour.\n\nIn 2010, Husband stepped down as Level 42's drummer for the second time, due to prior commitments with John McLaughlin. Pete Ray Biggin replaced Husband. In 2012, Level 42 toured the UK and mainland Europe, in celebration of the 25th anniversary since the release of Running in the Family, by playing the whole album, with a whole array of other hits. Also included in the shows was an acoustic set, with Mike Lindup playing the accordion. In October 2012, on Mark King's birthday during a gig in Bristol, Boon Gould joined the band on stage.\n\n2013–present: \"Sirens\" EP series and re-engagement with contemporary dance-pop:\nOn 20 and 21 September 2013, Level 42 (joined by an expanded brass section), performed three new songs at London's Indigo O2 Arena – \"Where's Yo' Head At\", \"Too Much Time\", and \"Sirens\". All of these appeared on the band's first new release for seven years, the six-song studio EP \"Sirens\" (released on 31 October 2013, and the first output from the band's new self-owned label Level 42 Records). Mixed by the American DJ John Morales, the EP also contained \"Mind on You\", \"My Independence Day\" and \"Build Myself a Rocket\" (with King's daughter Marlee providing the backing vocals on the last of these tracks). Musically, it built on the production approach of Retroglide while allying the band with contemporary developments in R&B and dance electronic.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, the band announced 'The Sirens Tour' – a 30-date tour, starting in October 2014 and taking in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. In the summer of 2014, the band performed at several festivals across Europe including headline performances at Let's Rock Bristol and Rochester Castle. They also played at Rewind festivals. At a performance in Bournemouth, ex-drummer Gary Husband returned due to Pete Ray Biggin being unavailable.\n\nIn 2015, the band appeared at a number of the UK and European festivals headlining at 'Let's Rock the Moor' and 'Carfest' concerts. They also played two nights at the Indigo2 in London where the band once again featured a larger brass section consisting of Dan Carpenter (trumpet) and Nicol Thomson (trombone) as well as regular saxophonist Sean Freeman.\n\nIn 2016, Level 42 performed at several festivals across the UK and Europe as well as in Curaçao, Chile, and Argentina before embarking on the UK, Netherlands, and Scandinavian tour to promote the \"Sirens II\" EP. On 1 May 2019, it was announced that Boon Gould had been found dead at his home in Dorset. He was 64. On 4 July 2019, Level 42 made a rare North American incursion, being the band to perform the first concert to launch the week-long «Festival d'été de Québec» (Quebec City Summer Festival). A rare treat for North American fans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Level+42\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

La banda ganó fama por la calidad de músicos como Mark King, cuya técnica magistral de tocar el bajo fue un trampolín para muchos éxitos de la banda.\nLos miembros fundadores de la banda fueron Mark King (Vocalista), Mike Lindup (Teclado y vocalista), Boon Gould (Guitarra) y el músico Philip Gould (batería). El teclista de estudio Wally Badarou contribuyó a muchos de sus primeros éxitos, y es considerado por muchos el quinto miembro del grupo, aunque nunca se unió oficialmente. Otros miembros a tiempo completo que han colaborado a lo largo de los años fueron Alan Murphy, Gary Husband, Jakko Jakszyk, Nathan King, Lyndon Connah y Sean Freeman.\nLa banda aún realiza conciertos en directo (con Mark King a la cabeza y con variaciones en su formación original), y su nuevo álbum, Retroglide, está previsto que salga el 18 de septiembre de 2006.\nLevel 42 se formó en 1979 como una banda que fusionaba el jazz y el funk. En principio la banda firmó con una pequeña discográfica indepediente, Elite Records. Poco después lanzaron el sencillo \"Love meeting Love\" en Elite Records, lo cual llamó la atención de Polydor Records y firmaron con ésta. Uno de los colaboradores de su nueva andadura, el teclista Wally Badarou, más tarde se convertiría por años en el co-productor de Level 42 y que Mark King llamaría el \"quinto miembro\" de la banda, pese a que tenía otros compromisos que le impedía ir de gira.\nEn 1981 sacaron \"Love Games\", un éxito que coparon las listas de ventas. Poco después lanzaron el álbum del mismo nombre. Fue todo un éxito en toda Europa.\nAl año siguiente, se hizo un segundo álbum The Pursuit of Accidents, y sencillos del álbum: el primero \"Weave Your Spell\" y luego salió \"The Chinese Way\", el último en particular llegó muy lejos en las listas de ventas, ganando en audiencia y en éxito. Entre tanto, Polydor lanzó The Early Tapes, grabado en tiempos en que la banda firmó con el sello discográfico Elite. Un cuarto álbum Standing in the Light colocó entre los diez primeros de las listas el éxito \"The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\" en Reino Unido en 1983. Grabado con los miembros de Earth, Wind and Fire, este álbum abrió una nueva era en la banda, menos experimental y de estilo jazz que sus anteriores lanzamientos. No había piezas enteramente instrumentales en este álbum y ninguno de los siguientes álbumes hasta el Staring at the Sun en 1988.\nEl cuarteto prosiguió con el álbum True Colours en 1984, el cual mezclaba estilos funk, pop, midtempo rock y baladas melosas. Dio paso a los sencillos \"The Chant Has Begun\" y \"Hot Water\". En ese mismo año, Mark King estaba inmerso en un proyecto en solitario: Influences. Además, el grupos fue aclamado también por sus poderosos directos en el escenario (como el directo grabado en álbum Physical Presence).\nEl siguiente álbum hecho en estudio fue World Machine, que salió en 1985. Los sencillos de éste, \"Something About You\" y \"Leaving Me Now\" fueron éxitos entre los diez primeros en las listas, seguido por otro, \"Lessons in Love\", a principios de 1986. Por entonces, la banda se alejó de su estilo jazz-funk y su tendencia fue el sonido pop. Elementos de las raíces de Level 42 todavía podían apreciarse en el funky \"Coup d'Etat\" y \"Dream Crazy\" en la versión británica del álbum, así como una larga pista instrumental llamada \"Hell\". Esta última pista del álbum no vio la luz del día hasta principios de 2000 como una descarga de MP3 en el antiguo Napster.\nEl álbum Running in the Family, 1987, se convirtió en su disco más vendido, y sentó las bases del estilo musical pop, con el bajo de Mark King, Lindup y los sonidos del teclista Badarou sirviendo como plantillas, para dar canciones pop acertadas como \"Lessons in Love\", la balada \"It's Over\" y el título del álbum.\nTanto Philip como Boon dejaron el grupo, descontentos por la creciente tendencia hacia la musica pop y agotados por las giras. Entonces, King contrató a Gary Husband y a Steve Topping para reemplazarlos. Husband recomendó a Topping, pero éste no se entendió bien con King debido a diferencias de personalidad. El guitarrista Alan Murphy se unió al grupo, ex-integrante de la banda Go West. También había tenido el guitarrista de estudio de Kate Bush. El nuevo álbum de Level 42 Staring at the Sun salió a la venta en 1988. Al año siguiente, Alan murió a causa de una efermedad relacionada con el SIDA y la banda desapareció por un tiempo. Entonces, se sacó al mercado Level Best, un recopilation con los grandes éxitos. En diciembre de 1990, la banda tocó unos conciertos en el Hammersmith Odeon de Londres, el cual ya había sido reservado dos años antes. Estos conciertos los caracterizaban Lyndon Connah en teclados y voces y Allan Holdsworth en la guitarra. En este año, Mike Lindup sacó también su álbum debut en solitario Changes.\nDurante principios de los 1990s, el grupo intentó extraer más de su recientes influencias musicales, como las de Mahavishnu Orchestra, pidiendo al músico Allan Holdsworth para aportar unos toques sorprendentes de guitarra para el álbum Guaranteed (sobre todo a \"A Kinder Eye\"). Pese a la buena acogida, especialmente de los críticos de la música de Estados Unidos, muchos de sus incondicionales del jazz-funk no les gustó su estilo rock-pop. El álbum no se vendió tan bien como se esperaba a pesar de haber realizado musicalmente el trabajo más sofisticado y elaborado por Level 42 hasta la fecha.\nSin embargo, la banda continuaba teniendo un potente directo en los escenarios, con miembros como Annie McCaig, que también hacía de voz de fondo en el álbum Guaranteed, y el dúo formado por el saxofonista Gary Barnacle y el trompetista John Thirkell, de los The Hen Pecked Horns. Además, Barnacle tocó en varios álbumes de estudio de los Level 42. Barnacle había sido antecedido como saxofonista de la gira por Krys Mach, quien también grabó con Level 42 y estuvo de gira con el grupo de 1984 a 1988.\nDespués de grabar Guaranteed y de una gira promocional de una semana, Holdworth, resuelto a no tocar más la guitarra, dejó la banda y fue reemplazado por Jakko Jakszyk. Aunque no en la grabación, Jakszyk figuró en la foto del álbum; también formó parte de promociones y en la gira para el álbum. Fue protagonista en canciones como \"At the Great Distance\" y \"As Years Go By\". Trabajos de estudio con Level 42 vinieron en forma de dos pistas (\"Fire\" y \"Free Your Soul\") que se incluyeron en los álbumes Guaranteed y Forever now respectivamente.\nEl álbum Forever Now de 1994, marcó el retorno de Philip Gould como percusionista de estudio y principal compositor de letras. En el álbum se vio que el grupo se acercaba a sus raíces Rythm&Blues-jazz, sobre todo en la balada \"Romance\", en la canción con influencias de acid-jazz \"Sunbed Song\" y la dance-pop \"Learn to Say No\".\nCon un álbum más que se requería como parte del acuerdo que tenía la banda con RCA Records, los incondicionales vieron un futuro prometedor para la banda, especialmente con el retorno Philip Gould y los halagos de la crítica musical con Forever Now; sin embargo, la fructífera reunión duró muy poco. Phil Gould, consternado por la ineptitud de la compañía discográfica, no continuó el camino emprendido con la banda y su gira Forever Now; anunció su retirada en medio de la gira. Esto pudo significar el fin de la banda.\nEn 1998, Mark King lanzó su segundo álbum en solitario One Man con letras de Boon Gould. En 1999, King volvió con nuevas composiciones y algunas de Level 42. A últimos 2001 llegó a un acuerdo con Mike Lindup y para renombrar su banda como 'Level 42'. Generalmente, este nuevo elenco estaba formado por King, el batería Gary Husband, Nathan King en guitarras y voces, Lyndon Connah en los teclados y voces y Sean Freeman en el saxofón y voces. Nuevas noticias en la web Level42.com (Mayo de 2006) hablan de un cambio de Lyndon por Mike Lindup en los teclados.\nEn agosto de 2000, se reunieron tres cuartas partes del elenco de Level 42 para un concierto privado. Philip Gould invitó a algunos amigos músicos para tocar en una fiesta, incluyendo a su hermano Boon y Mike Lindup. Dos años más tarde, King, Lindup y Philip Gould tocaron juntos (en la boda de Lindup) por primera vez en diez años. Esto les llevó a un intento de juntarse de nuevo como en sus inicios con Baradou. Sin embargo, la formación duró poco y viejas rencillas comenzaron a resurgir. El catalizador fue King en su empeño del control sobre la banda.\nAunque el grupo decidió no reagruparse, Boon Gould y Mike Lindup contribuyeron en su nuevo álbum, dirigido por King, pero con contribuciones de muchos integrantes de la banda en distintas épocas. El núevo álbum, Retroglide, previsto el lanzamiento para el 11 de septiembre de 2006, se anunció en febrero de 2006 con una gira por el Reino Unido, Holanda, Alemania y otros países europeos en octubre/noviembre de 2006 con Mike Lindup como invitado especial.\nEl nombre originario de la banda ha sido descrito en ocasiones como una inspiración de señal de un ascensor de un edificio alto de EE.UU.; El último piso del apacarmiento de coches más grande del mundo, en Japón; el piso en el cual el personaje de Jonathan Pryce reside en la película Brazil (que salió mucho después de que la banda ganara reconocimiento internacional); o la alargada edificación de la Ciudad de Londres llamada Tower 42 (conocida también por NatWest Tower).\nKing y Boon Gould decidieron que la banda debería llamarse simplemente por un número, y pensaron en el '88', el número de autobús que utilizaban para ir al estudio de grabación. No obstante, Lindup y Philip Gould vieron un póster de una banda llamada 'Rocket 88', así que abandonaron la idea (aunque '88' fue usado más tarde como el nombre de una canción). Entonces, se sugirió el '42' como nombre de la banda (número sacado de una novela de ciencia-ficción de Douglas Adams llamada The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). Se presume que el fallecido productor Andy Sojka propuso este nombre por haber leído esta novela también. En consecuencia, Se sabe que el uso del número '42' vino o de King o de Boon Gould o de Sojka. La palabra 'Level' se presume que pudo ser o de un abogado de Sojka o de un abogado de John Gould (el tercer hermano y mánager de la banda).\nOtros nombres considerados para el nombre de la banda fueron 'Powerline' y 'Kick in the head'. 'Powerline' se rechazó y se dio a otro de los grupos de Sojka, y fue en una grabación promocional donde las palabras 'Level 42' aparecieron por primera vez. Una pista en la cara B la llamaron 'Sandstorm' (una pista que querían llamar 'Kick in the head'). La cara A contenía una pista con el nombre de 'Powerline'.\n'Kick in the head' fue utilizado en su álbum 'True Colours', incluido en la canción 'A Floating Life'.\nOtras canciones instrumentales fueron bautizadas con números: '43', '88' y 'Forty-two'.",
