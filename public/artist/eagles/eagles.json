  "biography": "The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. The original lineup consisted of Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner, who had all previously performed with Linda Ronstadt, contributing to her 1972 self-titled album. The group signed with Asylum Records and released their debut album, \"Eagles\", in 1972. The album produced the US and Canadian top-20 singles \"Take It Easy\" and \"Witchy Woman\".\n\nTheir second album, \"Desperado\" (1973), peaked at number 41 in the United States, and although the title track did not chart as a single, it gained lasting popularity. In 1974, Don Felder joined the band, contributing to the album \"On the Border\", which included the top-40 single \"Already Gone\" and their first number-one hit in the US and Canada, \"Best of My Love\". The 1975 album \"One of These Nights\" became their first US number-one album and achieved top-ten status in several other countries. It featured the US number-one single \"One of These Nights\", as well as the top-five hits \"Lyin' Eyes\" and \"Take It to the Limit\". That same year, Leadon left the group and was replaced by Joe Walsh.\n\nIn 1976, the band released the compilation album \"Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)\", which went on to become the best-selling album in the United States, with sales exceeding 38 million copies. Later that year, they released \"Hotel California\", which sold over 26 million copies in the US and more than 32 million globally. The album included the US and Canadian number-one singles \"New Kid in Town\" and \"Hotel California\", the latter also becoming their only top-ten hit in the United Kingdom and reaching the top ten in several other countries.\n\nIn 1977, Timothy B. Schmit replaced Meisner. The following year, the band released \"The Long Run\", which featured the US number-one single \"Heartache Tonight\" and the top-ten hits \"The Long Run\" and \"I Can't Tell You Why\". The band disbanded in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the release of \"Hell Freezes Over\", a combination of live recordings and new studio material, followed by a series of tours.\n\nIn 2007, the Eagles released \"Long Road Out of Eden\", which became their sixth US number-one album. This was followed by the Long Road Out of Eden Tour in 2008. In 2013, they began the History of the Eagles Tour, coinciding with the release of a documentary of the same name. After Glenn Frey's death in 2016, the band resumed touring in 2017 with his son Deacon Frey and country artist Vince Gill sharing lead vocals. Deacon Frey departed in 2022 but returned in 2023 for the band's final tour. Randy Meisner died in 2023.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)\n\nStudio albums\n\nEagles (1972)\nDesperado (1973)\nOn the Border (1974)\nOne of These Nights (1975)\nHotel California (1976)\nThe Long Run (1979)\nLong Road Out of Eden (2007) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eagles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
