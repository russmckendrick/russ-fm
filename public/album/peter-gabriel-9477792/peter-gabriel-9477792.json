      "biography": "Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and activist. He rose to fame as the original lead singer of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, he launched a successful solo career with \"Solsbury Hill\" as his first single. His fifth studio album, So (1986), is his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. The album's most successful single, \"Sledgehammer\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards and, according to a report in 2011, it was MTV's most played music video of all time.\n\nGabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has also pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has also been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \"Biko\". He has participated in several human-rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the Witness human rights organisation in 1992. Gabriel developed The Elders with Richard Branson, which was launched by Nelson Mandela in 2007.\n\nGabriel has won three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male in 1987, six Grammy Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was made a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his \"influence on generations of music makers\". In recognition of his many years of human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize laureates in 2006, and Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. AllMusic has described Gabriel as \"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, followed by his induction as a solo artist in 2014. In March 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of South Australia in recognition of his achievements in music.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel\n\nStudio albums\nPeter Gabriel (1977; known as Peter Gabriel 1 and Car)\nPeter Gabriel (1978; known as Peter Gabriel 2 and Scratch)\nPeter Gabriel (1980; known as Peter Gabriel 3 and Melt)\nPeter Gabriel (1982; known as Peter Gabriel 4 and Security)\nSo (1986)\nUs (1992)\nUp (2002)\nScratch My Back (2010)\nNew Blood (2011)\ni/o (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "“I felt I wanted to write music for the 1980s, and that the place to begin was the rhythm track,” Peter Gabriel once said. “Rhythm being the spine of music, if you change the spine, the shape of the body changes as a matter of course.” Armed with a primitive drum machine, Gabriel took a sharp compositional detour for his third album, <i>Peter Gabriel 3: Melt</i>, letting his songwriting process lead with rhythm instead of chord changes. The sparse, percussion-driven album, released in 1980, became the place where his artistic ambitions finally coalesced, resulting in a peculiar and ominous piece of shadow-lurking art-rock that nonetheless spawned a pop hit.\n\nTraditional sounds were eschewed across the album. Gabriel banned the use of cymbals and hi-hats for drummers Jerry Marotta and Phil Collins, which explains such austere, atmospheric tracks as “Intruder” and “No Self Control”. But the in-studio innovations didn’t end there: Gabriel and Collins—working with producer Steve Lillywhite and engineer Hugh Padgham—also experimented with the explosive, cavernous sound that would be known as “gated reverb”, which would soon come to define the decade.\n\n<i>Melt</i> was also one of the first to use the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, a sampling keyboard whose trademark sound would take flight across the decade on records by Art of Noise, Herbie Hancock, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Tears for Fears. Rhythmically inspired by the soundtrack to the 1965 South African film <i>Dingaka</i>, Gabriel composed protest anthem and perennial set-closer “Biko”, a soaring tribute to activist Steve Biko that would help bring global attention to South African apartheid, and would directly inspire Steven Van Zandt’s <i>Sun City</i> project.\n\nBut Gabriel’s forward-thinking musicianship on <i>Melt</i> scared record execs. The album dealt in strange, supposedly uncommercial sounds, and featured dark lyrics sung from the perspective of assassins (“Family Snapshot”), perverts (“Intruder”) and the generally alienated (“I Don’t Remember”). Sensing a commercial disaster, Gabriel’s label in the US dropped him. It was a disastrous decision: After Mercury picked up <i>Melt</i>, the album became Gabriel’s biggest-selling to that point, and spawned a legitimate hit single in “Games Without Frontiers”. Featuring background vocals from Kate Bush, the anti-war tune became a top 10 smash in the UK and Canada, and a minor chart hit in the States—officially kicking off the former prog-rocker’s journey toward becoming a heavy player in the MTV era.",
