      "biography": "Patricia Lee \"Patti\" Smith (born December 30, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter, poet and visual artist, who became a highly influential component of the New York City punk rock movement with her 1975 debut album Horses.Called the \"Godmother of Punk\", her work was a fusion of rock and poetry. \n\nSmith's most widely known song is \"Because the Night\", which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978. In 2005, Patti Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, and in 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On November 17, 2010, she won the National Book Award for her memoir Just Kids. She is also a recipient of the 2011 Polar Music Prize.\n\nPatricia Lee Smith was born in Chicago. Her mother, Beverly, was a waitress, and her father, Grant, worked at the Honeywell plant. She spent her early childhood in Germantown, before her family moved to Woodbury Gardens, Deptford Township, New Jersey, raised Jehovah's Witness. She had a strong religious upbringing and a Bible education, but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining; much later, she wrote the line \"Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine\" in her cover version of Them's \"Gloria\" in response to this experience. She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of eleven or twelve, saying \"I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer\", but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion, and has come to the conclusion that religious dogmas are \"...man-made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not.\" At this early age Smith was exposed to her first records, including Shrimp Boats by Harry Belafonte, Patience and Prudence doing The Money Tree, and Another Side of Bob Dylan, which her mother gave to her. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964 and went to work in a factory. She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on April 26, 1967, and chose to place her for adoption.",

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> Calling <i>Horses</i> one of the first statements in punk raises the question of what punk is: A sound? An attitude? A political orientation? A stylistic one? In some ways, Smith was a traditionalist: She enshrined Bob Dylan, and once said that her blind love for her father was the first thing she sacrificed to Mick Jagger. In others, she was a radical—the resolve, the intensity, the way her performances stretch for a catharsis beyond sound. Reflecting on her label censoring her cover of The Who’s “My Generation” (she’d changed the line “Things they do look awful cold/I hope I die before I get old” to “I don’t need no f**king s**t/I hope I die because of it”), Smith said that that was the thing about rock ’n’ roll: It was total warfare, all the time.<br /> \nThe duality of <i>Horses</i> is that it sounds both deeply steeped in the history of rock—its story, its symbols, its legacy—while also trying to convey the music as though nobody had ever heard it before. So, when she opens her adaptation of Them’s “Gloria” with the line “Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” it’s to remind you that rock is the sound of heretics who will stake their life against orthodoxy. And when the apocalyptic visions of “Land” give way to the ’60s song “Land of 1,000 Dances”, it’s because teenagers expressing themselves through their bodies is a sacred, radical act. And when “Birdland” winds down with Smith singing doo-wop, it’s because sometimes feelings are so radiant that words fail.<br />\nEven at her artiest, Smith doesn’t flinch or distance herself with irony, turning her internal ecstasy outward with a rawness and naiveté that feels daring, unguarded but deadly confident—a trust fall in sound. There are moments when the language soars and the music breaks challenging new ground. But ultimately, <i>Horses</i> doesn’t ask to be understood—it asks only to be felt.
