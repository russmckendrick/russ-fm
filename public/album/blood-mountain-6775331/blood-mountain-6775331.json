      "biography": "Mastodon is an American metal band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 2000. The group is composed of Troy Sanders (bass/vocals), Bill Kelliher (rhythm guitar/backing vocals), and Brann Dailor (drums/vocals). The band's lead guitarist was Brent Hinds from 1999-2025. Mastodon has released seven studio albums, as well as a number of other releases. The band's 2002 debut album, Remission, garnered significant critical acclaim for its unique sound. Mastodon's second full-length release, Leviathan, is a concept album based on the novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. Three magazines awarded the record Album of the Year in 2004: Revolver, Kerrang! and Terrorizer.\n\nThe song \"Colony of Birchmen\" from the band's third album (released in 2006), Blood Mountain, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2007. Blood Mountain was followed in 2009 by Crack the Skye, and in 2011 by The Hunter, which debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart and achieved major commercial success in the United States. The Hunter features the song \"Curl of the Burl\", which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 2012. Mastodon's 2014 album, Once More 'Round the Sun, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart and features the band's third Grammy-nominated song, \"High Road\". The band's seventh album, Emperor of Sand, was released on March 31, 2017, and features the band's most commercially successful song to date, \"Show Yourself\", which peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in June 2017. The followup single, \"Steambreather\", peaked at number 18 on the same chart in October 2017. The album's opening track, \"Sultan's Curse\", earned the band their first Grammy award. Emperor of Sand was the band's first album to receive a Grammy nomination; it was nominated for Best Rock Album.\n\nMastodon was formed on January 13, 2000, after drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher moved to Atlanta from Victor, New York, and met bassist/singer Troy Sanders and guitarist/singer Brent Hinds at a High on Fire show. They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of sludge metal bands Melvins and Neurosis, heavy metal legends Iron Maiden, and 1970s hard rockers Thin Lizzy, and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he \"showed up so wasted he couldn't play\".\n\nThe band recorded a demo in 2000, which featured Eric Saner on vocals. Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four-song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records, Mastodon landed a record deal with Relapse Records in 2001. Mastodon released the EP Lifesblood in 2001, and its first full-length album, Remission, in 2002, with the singles \"March of the Fire Ants\" and \"Crusher/Destroyer\" (which was also featured on Tony Hawk's Underground). On each of Mastodon's first three full-length albums, the last track was an instrumental composition with a title that related to the Elephant Man.\n\nArtist Paul Romano was responsible for all of the band's album art and backdrops up to 2011. The artwork for the band's fifth studio album The Hunter was made by AJ Fosik, a woodcarver who was also responsible for the backdrop the band used live at the time. Oakland-based artist Skinner, who, in his own words, specializes in \"psychedelic nightmare paintings\", has taken the reins on Once More 'Round the Sun. \"It's going to be a work of art for sure. It's going to be very eye-opening\", said bassist Troy Sanders before the album's release. \"Very striking. It's from another dimension, and a lot of our music is geared toward that idea—taking you to another planet on songs. It's out there, and I think it's incredible.\"\n\nStudio albums\nRemission (2002)\nLeviathan (2004)\nBlood Mountain (2006)\nCrack the Skye (2009)\nThe Hunter (2011)\nOnce More 'Round the Sun (2014)\nEmperor of Sand (2017)\nHushed and Grim (2021)\n\nEPs\nLifesblood (2001)\nCold Dark Place (2017) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mastodon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Singer/guitarist Brent Hinds rages like a maddened prophet confronting every Angel of Hell imaginable, howling himself raw with defiance. “Crystal Skull,” “Colony of Birchmen,” “Hand of Stone” and similar tracks invoke gore-spattered Nordic tales of the supernatural, brought to seething life with shifting tempos and stabbing guitar strokes. Beneath the album’s volcanic surface, there is surprising nuance, revealed in the jazzy undercurrents of “Capillarian Crest” and the hyperkinetic grandeur of “Bladecatcher.” “Sleeping Giant” stretches forth like a majestic arctic sea, while “Circle of Cysquatch” throbs with the fury of a flagellation ritual. Mastodon fully struts its elephantine stuff on “Pendulous Skin,” a vast, multi-textured sojourn into the band’s inner universe. At times, <i>Blood Mountain</i> nearly sinks into aural murkiness and lyric obscurity. Admittedly, the album is a lot to digest — but for those seeking epochal metal with a dark twist, this sprawling work offers massive satisfaction.",

            "content": "Blood Mountain is the third full-length studio album by metal band Mastodon. The recording of the album finished in April, 2006 and it was released on September 11 in the UK and September 12, 2006 in North America.\nLike Mastodon's previous studio work Leviathan, Blood Mountain is a concept album. According to bassist Troy Sanders, \"It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle.\"\nThe album includes guest appearances by Scott Kelly of Neurosis on \"Crystal Skull\", Joshua Homme of Queens of the Stone Age on \"Colony of Birchmen\", as well as keyboardist Isaiah \"Ikey\" Owens and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala of The Mars Volta on \"Pendulous Skin\" and \"Siberian Divide\", respectively.\nMusic videos for \"The Wolf Is Loose,\" \"Colony of Birchmen,\" \"Sleeping Giant\" and \"Capillarian Crest\" have been made. Although the video for \"Capillarian Crest\" is made up of live footage, the studio version of the song is played.\nGuitarist Bill Kelliher considers this album to represent the earth element. Vocalist/bassist Troy Sanders calls this \"sonically the best album we have done.\"\nThe band's emphasis on clean, melodic vocals instead of the harsher vocals that the band used on their early work continues to grow on this album.\nThe album in full could be streamed at the band's MySpace page a few days prior to the release.\nBlood Mountain debuted on #32 spot in Billboard 200 best selling album charts, marking the highest debut in the band's career. By December 2006, the album had sold more than 65,000 copies in the U.S. alone according to their website . By March 2009, the album had sold 150,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen Soundscan\n\nBlood Mountain was largely well received by critics. Total Guitar magazine voted it its Number One album of 2006, and magazines such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang! have stated that it is every bit as good as the band's previous album Leviathan, if not better. The album has also charted in many websites and magazines 2006 countdowns. The band's first single off the album, \"Capillarian Crest\", was ranked #27 in Rolling Stone magazine Top 100 songs of 2006. Blood Mountain was ranked 9th in Rolling Stone Top 50 Albums of 2006/2, and 42nd in Pitchfork's Top 50 Albums of 2006.\nBlood Mountain was voted the best album of 2006 in the UK Metal Hammer magazine end-of year polls, as well as top in Total Guitar magazine's top 50 albums of 2006. It was also rated the 17th greatest metal album of all time by a countdown recently done by gaming website IGN. However, the album is not without its detractors, as The Guardian states that the album is unorganized and feels as if the tracks are far longer than they actually are, which resulted in the 1/5 rating.\n\nThe main character is in search of the Crystal Skull which he hopes to place at the top of Blood Mountain. In the making of DVD, the Crystal Skull is supposed to remove \"the reptile brain\" causing its owner the ability to achieve the next step of human evolution.\nIn an interview with bassist Troy Sanders it was revealed that a Cysquatch is \"a one-eyed Sasquatch that can see into the future.\" The Cysquatch warns the main character of the following dangers during the journey for the Crystal Skull.\nAlthough not officially confirmed by the band, Birchmen are supposed to be a race of tree people that grow abnormally fast, and form one giant tree.\n\nThe album's last song, \"Pendulous Skin\", contains a secret \"fan letter\" from Josh Homme, who provided guest vocals on the album. At 21:25, he says: \"Dear Mastodon: My name is Joshua. I'm a big fan from Southern Cal. Really diggin' on your new scene. That's why I hope you don't mind when I got your new demos for your new CD, I had to sing parts on them and send them to you as a tribute.

The recording of the album finished in April, 2006 and it was released on September 11 in the UK and September 12, 2006 in North America. Like Mastodon's previous studio work Leviathan, Blood Mountain is a concept album. According to bassist Troy Sanders, \"It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle.\" The album includes <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mastodon/Blood+Mountain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."

The recording of the album finished in April, 2006 and it was released on September 11 in the UK and September 12, 2006 in North America.\nLike Mastodon's previous studio work Leviathan, Blood Mountain is a concept album. According to bassist Troy Sanders, \"It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle.\"\nThe album includes guest appearances by Scott Kelly of Neurosis on \"Crystal Skull\", Joshua Homme of Queens of the Stone Age on \"Colony of Birchmen\", as well as keyboardist Isaiah \"Ikey\" Owens and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala of The Mars Volta on \"Pendulous Skin\" and \"Siberian Divide\", respectively.\nMusic videos for \"The Wolf Is Loose,\" \"Colony of Birchmen,\" \"Sleeping Giant\" and \"Capillarian Crest\" have been made. Although the video for \"Capillarian Crest\" is made up of live footage, the studio version of the song is played.\nGuitarist Bill Kelliher considers this album to represent the earth element. Vocalist/bassist Troy Sanders calls this \"sonically the best album we have done.\"\nThe band's emphasis on clean, melodic vocals instead of the harsher vocals that the band used on their early work continues to grow on this album.\nThe album in full could be streamed at the band's MySpace page a few days prior to the release.\nBlood Mountain debuted on #32 spot in Billboard 200 best selling album charts, marking the highest debut in the band's career. By December 2006, the album had sold more than 65,000 copies in the U.S. alone according to their website . By March 2009, the album had sold 150,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen Soundscan\n\nBlood Mountain was largely well received by critics. Total Guitar magazine voted it its Number One album of 2006, and magazines such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang! have stated that it is every bit as good as the band's previous album Leviathan, if not better. The album has also charted in many websites and magazines 2006 countdowns. The band's first single off the album, \"Capillarian Crest\", was ranked #27 in Rolling Stone magazine Top 100 songs of 2006. Blood Mountain was ranked 9th in Rolling Stone Top 50 Albums of 2006/2, and 42nd in Pitchfork's Top 50 Albums of 2006.\nBlood Mountain was voted the best album of 2006 in the UK Metal Hammer magazine end-of year polls, as well as top in Total Guitar magazine's top 50 albums of 2006. It was also rated the 17th greatest metal album of all time by a countdown recently done by gaming website IGN. However, the album is not without its detractors, as The Guardian states that the album is unorganized and feels as if the tracks are far longer than they actually are, which resulted in the 1/5 rating.\n\nThe main character is in search of the Crystal Skull which he hopes to place at the top of Blood Mountain. In the making of DVD, the Crystal Skull is supposed to remove \"the reptile brain\" causing its owner the ability to achieve the next step of human evolution.\nIn an interview with bassist Troy Sanders it was revealed that a Cysquatch is \"a one-eyed Sasquatch that can see into the future.\" The Cysquatch warns the main character of the following dangers during the journey for the Crystal Skull.\nAlthough not officially confirmed by the band, Birchmen are supposed to be a race of tree people that grow abnormally fast, and form one giant tree.\n\nThe album's last song, \"Pendulous Skin\", contains a secret \"fan letter\" from Josh Homme, who provided guest vocals on the album. At 21:25, he says: \"Dear Mastodon: My name is Joshua. I'm a big fan from Southern Cal. Really diggin' on your new scene. That's why I hope you don't mind when I got your new demos for your new CD, I had to sing parts on them and send them to you as a tribute. I hope you're not mad about me also uploading them onto the Internet. But hell, it seems like you guys are so cool that you might dig something just like that. Sincerely, your fan, Joshua M. Homme. P.S., Keep it real...REAL (studio effects are used)....*laughter*....REAL.\" When asked about the message in a Pitchfork Media interview, Homme said, \"I was just fucking with them.
