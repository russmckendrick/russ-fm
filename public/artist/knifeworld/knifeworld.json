  "biography": "Knifeworld is the new band from Kavus Torabi (Cardiacs, The Monsoon Bassoon, Guapo). The forthcoming album also features a handful of special guests, including Ben Jacobs (Max Tundra) on trumpet, Melanie Woods (Sidi Bou Said, Cardiacs) on vocals, Katharine Blake (Miranda Sex Garden, Mediæval Bæbes) on recorders, Sarah Measures (The Monsoon Bassoon, Mothlite) on horns and flute, and Khyam Allami on drums.\n\nPissed Up On Brake Fluid, the first Knifeworld single, will be released by Believers Roast on July 13th 2009. It is probably the closest thing to a 'straightforward rock song' Torabi has ever written.  The B-side, Happy Half-life, Dear Friend is not.  It's barely even rock. It is, however, extremely psychedelic.\n\nForthcoming debut album, Buried Alone: Tales Of Crushing Defeat, is a sprawling psychedelic meisterwork, taking in elements of pop, heavy rock, hardcore, avant-progressive and folk, and is due out on August 10th 2009. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Knifeworld\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
