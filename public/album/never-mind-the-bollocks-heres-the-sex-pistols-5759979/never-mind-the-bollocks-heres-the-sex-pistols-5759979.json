      "biography": "The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975. They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Although their initial career lasted just two-and-a-half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.\nThe Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of impresario Malcolm McLaren, the band provoked controversies that took Britain by storm. Their concerts repeatedly faced difficulties with organizers and authorities, and public appearances often ended in mayhem. Their 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, precipitated the \"last and greatest outbreak of pop-based moral pandemonium\".\nIn January 1978, at the end of a turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten left the band and announced its break-up. Over the next several months, the three other band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979. In 1996, Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock reunited for the Filthy Lucre Tour; since 2002, they have staged further reunion shows and tours. On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols-the four original members plus Vicious-were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \"a piss stain\".",

      "editorial_notes": "A few months after the Sex Pistols released their first and only album, lead singer John Lydon stood onstage in San Francisco and asked the audience if they ever had the feeling they’d been cheated. The question could’ve been self-deprecating—as in, after a year of hype and rhetoric about the revolutionary power of rock ’n’ roll, weren’t you expecting a little more from the Sex Pistols?\n\nBut Lydon could’ve easily been asking the question of himself. The Sex Pistols hadn’t tried to destroy the business and culture of rock ’n’ roll, but they hadn’t planned on becoming a casualty of it either. And now, here they were, sponging up the spit and beer-spray of hundreds of disaffected teenagers who took their messages of blind rebellion to heart. Their manager, Malcolm McLaren, had purposely avoided booking the band in places like Los Angeles and New York in favour of Southern cities where the cultural clash—between young British punks and a presumably conservative part of America—would be more volatile. If it was all just controversy, you’d feel cheated too. They didn’t play another show for nearly 20 years.\n\nWhereas <i>The Clash</i> has a set of politics, 1977’s <i>Never Mind the Bollocks</i> doesn’t. They don’t like other people (“Anarchy in the U.K.”) but don’t seem to like themselves either (“No Feelings”). They have nothing good to say about the older generation (“God Save the Queen”) and worse to say about the younger one (“Pretty Vacant”). In the same way that a St. Bernard looks melancholy regardless of how it feels, Lydon conveys a disgust that runs so deep, it feels beyond performance. The album’s bleakest song, “Bodies”, isn’t just a snapshot of an aborted fetus and its dehumanized mother—it was written about a fan.\n\nThere’s a provocative quality to it, but there’s a purity too: You sense that there is no power they can tolerate, no state they can trust, no tradition by which they can abide. Except, maybe, rock ’n’ roll, which they try to rescue from the jaws of the ’70s by playing as loudly and simply as possible. They’re not here to change things or make them better. Instead, they look at the world like stoics, or prophets of the apocalypse. The scary thing about <i>Never Mind the Bollocks</i> isn’t how serious it is, but how it manages to make everything sound like a joke.",

It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the most important albums of all time.\n\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were controversial, having sworn on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in most parts of England. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"bollocks\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. It was finally released in the UK by Virgin Records on 28 October 1977.\n\nDue in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts.
