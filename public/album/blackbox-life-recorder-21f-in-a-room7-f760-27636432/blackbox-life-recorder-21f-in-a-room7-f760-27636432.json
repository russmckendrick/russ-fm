      "biography": "Richard David James (born 18 August 1971), best known as Aphex Twin, is an Irish-born British musician, composer, and DJ. He is renowned for his distinctive contributions to electronic genres such as techno, ambient, and jungle.\n\nA true musical genius of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Aphex Twin has been a pioneer in the electronic music landscape throughout his prolific, multifaceted career. Under various aliases, James has laid the foundation for ambient techno, drill 'n' bass, and dark ambient across six remarkable studio albums and numerous EPs and side projects. He has also crafted a unique visual identity, expressed through his iconic logo and collaborations with video director Chris Cunningham. Moreover, he has become an influential figure for artists as diverse as Thom Yorke and Pharrell Williams. Year by year, the mythos surrounding him continues to grow, ensuring he remains as culturally relevant as ever. Journalists from publications including Mixmag, The New York Times, NME, Fact, Clash, and The Guardian have called James one of the most influential or important artists in contemporary electronic music.\n\nRaised in Cornwall, James began DJing at free parties and clubs in the area in the late 1980s. His debut EP, Analogue Bubblebath, released in 1991 on Mighty Force Records, garnered an early following; he began performing across the UK and continental Europe. That same year, James co-founded the independent label Rephlex Records. His 1992 debut album, Selected Ambient Works 85-92, released by Belgian label Apollo, received wider critical and popular acclaim. James signed to Warp in 1993 and subsequently released charting albums such as ...I Care Because You Do (1995) and Richard D. James Album (1996), as well as Top 40 singles like \"Come to Daddy\" (1997) and \"Windowlicker\" (1999); the latter two were accompanied by music videos directed by Chris Cunningham, bringing James significantly wider international attention.\n\nAfter releasing Drukqs in 2001 and completing his contract with Warp, James spent several years releasing music on his own Rephlex label, including the 2005 Analord EP series under his AFX alias and a pair of 2007 releases as The Tuss. In 2014, he made available a previously unreleased 1994 LP as Caustic Window. He returned later that year with the Aphex Twin album Syro on Warp, which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album. He has since released charting EPs including Cheetah (2016) and Collapse (2018).\n\nIn July 2023, Aphex Twin released the EP Blackbox Life Recorder 21f / in a room7 F760, marking his first new music in five years. \n\nIn October 2024, to commemorate its 30th anniversary, James reissued an expanded edition of Selected Ambient Works Volume II. This edition features remastered tracks and additional material, providing both longtime fans and new listeners with an enhanced experience of this seminal work.\n\nOn 17 December 2024, he surprised fans with the compilation album Music From The Merch Desk (2016–2023). This 38-track collection features limited-edition singles that were originally sold during his tours from 2016 to 2023, providing a comprehensive overview of his live merchandise offerings during that period. The compilation includes tracks from the previously mysterious record Houston, TX 12.17.16, released eight years prior, as well as newer tracks sold at the 2023 All Points East festival. Critics have noted that this release encapsulates the chaotic genius of Aphex Twin, offering both bangers and beauty in a single package. \n\nThroughout his career, Aphex Twin has maintained a reputation for unpredictability and innovation, continually pushing the boundaries of electronic music and influencing countless artists across various genres. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aphex+Twin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
