      "biography": "Faith No More is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, hailed as one of the most influential metal/rock bands of the late 80s and early 90s, and credited for inventing alternative metal and as an influence on nu metal. It was formed originally as Faith No Man in 1981 by bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist Wade Worthington, vocalist M Morris, and drummer Mike Bordin. A year later when Worthington was replaced by keyboardist Roddy Bottum, who along with Gould and Bordin, formed Faith No More. After going through a series of singers which included Courtney Love, the band was joined by Chuck Mosley in 1983. The same year, Jim Martin was recruited to replace guitarist Mark Bowen.\n\nFaith No More underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, We Care a Lot, in 1985. Within a year the band signed up with Slash Records, and in 1987 their second album Introduce Yourself was released. Membership remained stable until vocalist Mosley was replaced by Mike Patton in 1988. In 1989, the band released their highly successful album, The Real Thing, which featured their breakthrough hit single \"Epic\". The band's next album, 1992's Angel Dust, was also highly successful and spawned the hit \"MidLife Crisis\", which became their sole #1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in their career. Angel Dust is widely considered to be one of the most influential albums of the 90's. Faith No More however declined in popularity in the subsequent years. Longtime guitarist Jim Martin left the group in 1994 and was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. After the release of their next album, 1995's King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime, Spruance was replaced briefly by Dean Menta, who would eventually be replaced by their current guitarist Jon Hudson. After releasing one more album, Album of the Year, in 1997, Faith No More broke up in April 1998, and all members began work on side projects.\n\nOn February 24, 2009, Faith No More announced that they would be reforming for a European tour with the same lineup at the time of their breakup. In June 2009, they performed together for the first time in eleven years at the Brixton Academy in London, United Kingdom, as part of their The Second Coming Tour. Throughout 2010, the band continued to perform at multiple live venues. In September 2010, the band announced that the reunion tour would come to an end in December and plans for a new album had been scrapped, although bassist Billy Gould has said recently that the band might continue. Faith No More returned again in November 14th 2011 at the SWU Music and Arts Festival, in the Brazilian city of PaulÃ­nia, as well on three other dates. Trey Spruance joined the band onstage for the very first time to perform the King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime album in its entirety in Santiago, Chile in November 2011.",

            "content": "Sol Invictus (Latin, 'Unconquered Sun') is the seventh studio album by American rock band Faith No More, released on May 19, 2015. It was Faith No More's first studio album following 1997's Album of the Year, marking the longest gap between two studio albums in their career, and their first release on Reclamation Records. Sol Invictus was also the band's first album since 1992's Angel Dust to feature the same lineup as its predecessor.\n\nThe album marked the group's fifth collaboration with longtime producer Matt Wallace, this time helping with the final mix rather than a more substantial producing role.\nOn February 24, 2009 after months of speculation and rumors, Faith No More announced they would be reforming with a line-up identical to the Album of the Year era, embarking on a reunion tour called The Second Coming Tour. To coincide with the band's reunion tour, Rhino released the sixth Faith No More compilation, The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection, a double album that includes their hit singles and b sides & rarities, in the UK on June 8. Faith No More then played in major European festivals including, Download Festival in the UK in June, Hurricane and Southside festivals in Germany, Greenfield Festival in Switzerland, Hove Festival in Norway and Roskilde Festival in Denmark, among other dates. The tour continued into 2010 with appearances at the Soundwave Festival in Australian cities throughout February and March. During their tour, the band added covers to their repertoire including \"Switch\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees.\n\nAfter an eleven-month hiatus, Faith No More played four shows in South America in November 2011. On the first date (November 8, 2011), the band played a \"mystery song\" - later confirmed as \"Matador\" - which led to speculation of new material. They played Sonisphere France on July 7, 2012.\n\nIn a January 2013 interview, Mike Patton suggested that the band would not remain active beyond the reunion tour, stating that \"it's sort of petered out\" and the band was \"maybe a little too conscious for  own good.\" In July 2013, Billy Gould hinted the band may record new material in the future, saying \"We will do something again only when all members are with the focus on that, and ready for the challenge. This is not the time... yet.\" On July 4, 2014, Faith No More played their first show in two years at Hyde Park in London, supporting Black Sabbath. At that show, Faith No More debuted two new songs \"Motherfucker\" and \"Superhero\" (also known by fans as \"Leader of Men\"). On September 2, Bill Gould revealed to Rolling Stone that Faith No More had begun work on a new album. On February 10, 2015 the band announced the title of their new album, Sol Invictus, and was set to be released on May 19, 2015.\n\"Motherfucker\" was the first single to be released from Sol Invictus. It was released on November 28, 2014 exclusively on 7\" vinyl to coincide with Record Store Day's Black Friday. It was later released digitally on December 5, 2014. The \"Superhero\" single was initially scheduled to be released on March 17, 2015 on 7\" vinyl, but was delayed to March 23 after the pressing plants suffered from adverse weather effects. A free preview of the song was made available March 1, 2015 through several media outlets, including Marvel.com, YouTube via Ipecac Recordings, and on BBC Radio 1's Rock Show. \"Superhero\" was also able to be purchased from iTunes later that day. BBC Radio 6 Music confirmed that \"Sunny Side Up\" will be the next single.\n\nMusic videos were made for \"Sunny Side Up\" and \"Separation Anxiety\" during 2015. The \"Sunny Side Up\" video, directed by Joe Lynch, is set in a nursing home, while \"Separation Anxiety\" uses footage from the 1955 horror film Dementia. On September 19, 2016, Faith No More released a preview for a music video for \"Cone of Shame\" that was written & directed by Goce Cvetanovski.\nOn Sol Invictus, the band drops the slap bass and rap techniques of prior releases, instead utilizing middle-range vocals. Musically, the album continues the band's tradition of experimenting in various genres, including post-punk, heavy metal, ska, and even dirges. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/Sol+Invictus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
