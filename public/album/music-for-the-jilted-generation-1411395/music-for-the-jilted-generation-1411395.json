      "biography": "The Prodigy is an English electronic music group from Braintree, Essex, formed by Liam Howlett in 1990. The current members include Liam Howlett (keyboardist and composer), Keith Flint (dancer and vocalist) and Maxim (MC and vocalist). Leeroy Thornhill (dancer and occasional live keyboardist) was a member of the band from 1990 to 2000, as was a female dancer and vocalist called Sharky who left the group during their early period.\n\nAlong with The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method and other acts, The Prodigy have been credited as pioneers of the big beat genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s. They have sold over 25 million records worldwide. The group has won numerous music awards throughout their career, including two Brit Awards—winning Best British Dance Act twice, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Kerrang! Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards, and have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards.\n\nThe group's brand of music makes use of various styles ranging from rave, hardcore techno, electro-industrial, jungle and breakbeat in the early 1990s to big beat and electronic rock with punk vocal elements in later times. The Prodigy first emerged on the underground rave scene in the early 1990s and have since achieved popularity and worldwide renown. They have been called \"the premiere dance act for the alternative masses\" and \"the Godfathers of Rave\".\n\nMusical style and influences\nAlong with the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, and other acts, the Prodigy have been credited as pioneers of the big beat genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. The Prodigy are also considered alternative dance, techno, electronica, breakbeat hardcore, and rave.\n\nLiam Howlett cited early electro as a big influence, mentioning tunes like \"Clear\" by American music group Cybotron and \"Al Naafiysh\" by Hashim. Liam Howlett also cited The Bomb Squad, Public Enemy, and Rage Against the Machine as influences.",

The album was re-released in 2008 as More Music for the Jilted Generation. The re-release includes remastered and bonus tracks.\n\nIt is largely a response to the corruption of the rave scene in England by its mainstream status as well as Great Britain's Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which effectively criminalised raves, rave culture, and by implication, rave music itself. The latter is exemplified in the song \"Their Law\" (predominant lyric: \"Fuck 'em and their law\"), and the spoken word intro, which paraphrases a quote from The Lawnmower Man.\n\nWhen Liam Howlett came to the cutting room for the final phase in the album production he realized that all the tracks he had originally planned for wouldn't fit onto a CD so One Love had to be edited, The Heat (The Energy) was slightly cut and the track called \"We Eat Rhythm\" was left out. \"We Eat Rhythm\" was later released on a free cassette with Select Magazine in October '94 entitled 'Select Future Tracks'.\n\nThe cover of the inner artwork of the record was analysed in an article published in 2008 in the techno underground Magazine Datacide. The author compares the picture with a persiflage which was published in 2003 on the Kid606 album Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You. The article not only describes the representation of Raves in graphic artwork but also describes the marketing strategy of the band with the album and criticises it from a pretentious point of view:\n\n    'With the picture The Prodigy are taking a stance in the conflict of ravers versus the police in those days. At the same time this statement is used to market a rebellious attitude. The picture is part of the artwork of a record - which is of course a commodity. The teenage (and male) consumer ought to identify himself with the presented rebellion. With the help of the artwork a certain image of The Prodigy is established: They should be seen as anti-stars, who define themselves through refusal and opposition.\n\n    * Rolling Stone (20 April 1995, p.80) - 3.5 Stars - Very Good - \"A soundtrack for those British rave hordes who dodge Tory truncheons, Music for the Jilted Generation thrills initiates with a political buzz Americans might miss. But the Prodigy's hard-core techno generates universal dance fever....Truly trippy.\"\n\n    * Alternative Press (April 1995, p.84) - \"Jilted Generation throws much darker shapes than its predecessor. Moreover, it slams harder and rawer and covers more ground--21st century hip hop, Latin funk, horror trance, Vapourspace-like ambient--in addition to their usual crowd-pleasing, hi-NRG tekno. Thumbs up for the use of guitar and flute, too.\"\n\n    * Option (July–August 1995, pp. 129–131) – \"...the Prodigy jolts an industrial sensibility with techno drive and then rides the seemingly endless grooves until we're numb...for intensely pumping dance music, this album has more life than most.\"\n\n    * Mojo (p.56) - Ranked #83 in Mojo's \"100 Modern Classics\" – \"One-man Bomb Squad Liam Howlett was a breakbeat maker without peer.\"\n\n    * Spin (September 1999, p.150) - Ranked #60 in Spin's \"90 Greatest Albums of the '90s\".\n\n    * NME (24 December 1994, p.22) - Ranked #9 in NME's list of the \"Top 50 Albums Of 1994\".\n\n    * Q - Voted the 62nd greatest album of all time by Q readers in early 1998 and ranked one of the best British albums of the last 50 years in 2008.\n\n    * It is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n    * On 4 December 2008, Zane Lowe inducted it into his 'masterpieces' by playing the album in full on his BBC Radio 1 show.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/Music+for+the+Jilted+Generation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

But the Prodigy's hard-core techno generates universal dance fever....Truly trippy.\"\n\n    * Alternative Press (April 1995, p.84) - \"Jilted Generation throws much darker shapes than its predecessor. Moreover, it slams harder and rawer and covers more ground--21st century hip hop, Latin funk, horror trance, Vapourspace-like ambient--in addition to their usual crowd-pleasing, hi-NRG tekno. Thumbs up for the use of guitar and flute, too.\"\n\n    * Option (July–August 1995, pp. 129–131) – \"...the Prodigy jolts an industrial sensibility with techno drive and then rides the seemingly endless grooves until we're numb...for intensely pumping dance music, this album has more life than most.\"\n\n    * Mojo (p.56) - Ranked #83 in Mojo's \"100 Modern Classics\" – \"One-man Bomb Squad Liam Howlett was a breakbeat maker without peer.\"\n\n    * Spin (September 1999, p.150) - Ranked #60 in Spin's \"90 Greatest Albums of the '90s\".\n\n    * NME (24 December 1994, p.22) - Ranked #9 in NME's list of the \"Top 50 Albums Of 1994\".\n\n    * Q - Voted the 62nd greatest album of all time by Q readers in early 1998 and ranked one of the best British albums of the last 50 years in 2008.\n\n    * It is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n    * On 4 December 2008, Zane Lowe inducted it into his 'masterpieces' by playing the album in full on his BBC Radio 1 show.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/Music+for+the+Jilted+Generation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
