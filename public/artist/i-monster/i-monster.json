  "biography": "I Monster is an English electronic music group, composed of the Sheffield based record producers Dean Honer and Jarrod Gosling.\nI Monster and its label Twins of Evil are both named after horror films.\n\nThey formed in 1997 and released their debut album These Are Our Children in 1998. However, due to Honer being involved with hitmakers All Seeing I, it was not until 2001 that they released their first single, \"Daydream in Blue\", a remix of The Gunter Kallmann Choir's version of The Wallace Collection's \"Daydream\". The song was originally released on 7\" on Honer's own record label Cercle Records, which he founded with Add N to (X)'s Barry Seven. It was later re-released with a new mix on Instant Karma (in association with their own label Twins of Evil); which has also released material from Kings Have Long Arms and Mu Chan Clan. The song also featured on episode 3 of season 1 in the BBC Television television drama Hustle. The track peaked at #20 in the UK Singles Chart in June 2001.\nThey released their acclaimed second album Neveroddoreven in 2003, which was re-released with a new sleeve in 2004. The members are regular guest DJs across the country and have played live shows in London and at various European music festivals. Part of the live band is made up of Fred de Fred and Marion Benoist from The Lovers, on guitar and vocals respectively.\nIn 2007, I Monster started collaborating with Finnish pop artist, HK119, for her second album. The resulting project, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control was released in September 2008 on One Little Indian Records, and saw I Monster co-write and co-produce over three quarters of the album. This collaboration came from Dean Honers previous role as a remixer for HK119's debut single, \"Pick Me Up\", from her debut eponymous album in 2006.\nIn 2009, the band released the follow-up to Neveroddoreven, titled A Dense Swarm of Ancient Stars.\nIn 2011, the band produced The Human League's Credo, its first album in 10 years.\nThe band's music also been used in a number of films such as Shaun of the Dead, Riders (Steal), the snowboard video \"From _______ with Love\" (Mack Dawg Productions), and has been sampled by hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco on his second single, \"Daydreamin'\". It was also used in the Ford Focus ST advertisement in the UK, and was also translated into other languages (for example, Turkish) for use in other European countries.\nThe \"Glamour Puss\" remix of their song \"Hey Mrs.\" was used in television commercials for Absolut Vodka and television series Eureka.\n\"These Are Our Children\" was used several times on the Australian television series Underbelly; and was subsequently released as part of the Underbelly soundtrack. It was also used as background music in episode 5 of the ITV drama Married Single Other. The song \"Heaven\" was used in the introduction to the TV show Numb3rs in episode 21, season 5.",

      "biography_en": "I Monster is an English electronic music group, composed of the Sheffield based record producers Dean Honer and Jarrod Gosling.\nI Monster and its label Twins of Evil are both named after horror films.\n\nThey formed in 1997 and released their debut album These Are Our Children in 1998. However, due to Honer being involved with hitmakers All Seeing I, it was not until 2001 that they released their first single, \"Daydream in Blue\", a remix of The Gunter Kallmann Choir's version of The Wallace Collection's \"Daydream\". The song was originally released on 7\" on Honer's own record label Cercle Records, which he founded with Add N to (X)'s Barry Seven. It was later re-released with a new mix on Instant Karma (in association with their own label Twins of Evil); which has also released material from Kings Have Long Arms and Mu Chan Clan. The song also featured on episode 3 of season 1 in the BBC Television television drama Hustle. The track peaked at #20 in the UK Singles Chart in June 2001.\nThey released their acclaimed second album Neveroddoreven in 2003, which was re-released with a new sleeve in 2004. The members are regular guest DJs across the country and have played live shows in London and at various European music festivals. Part of the live band is made up of Fred de Fred and Marion Benoist from The Lovers, on guitar and vocals respectively.\nIn 2007, I Monster started collaborating with Finnish pop artist, HK119, for her second album. The resulting project, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control was released in September 2008 on One Little Indian Records, and saw I Monster co-write and co-produce over three quarters of the album. This collaboration came from Dean Honers previous role as a remixer for HK119's debut single, \"Pick Me Up\", from her debut eponymous album in 2006.\nIn 2009, the band released the follow-up to Neveroddoreven, titled A Dense Swarm of Ancient Stars.\nIn 2011, the band produced The Human League's Credo, its first album in 10 years.\nThe band's music also been used in a number of films such as Shaun of the Dead, Riders (Steal), the snowboard video \"From _______ with Love\" (Mack Dawg Productions), and has been sampled by hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco on his second single, \"Daydreamin'\". It was also used in the Ford Focus ST advertisement in the UK, and was also translated into other languages (for example, Turkish) for use in other European countries.\nThe \"Glamour Puss\" remix of their song \"Hey Mrs.\" was used in television commercials for Absolut Vodka and television series Eureka.\n\"These Are Our Children\" was used several times on the Australian television series Underbelly; and was subsequently released as part of the Underbelly soundtrack. It was also used as background music in episode 5 of the ITV drama Married Single Other. The song \"Heaven\" was used in the introduction to the TV show Numb3rs in episode 21, season 5.",

      "biography_fr": " Monster est un duo de musiciens anglais, originaire de Sheffield, composé de Dean Honer et Jarrod Gosling. Leur registre appartient à la musique électronique avec des mélodies diverses, pop, electro, rappelant certaines musiques de films.\nLe groupe a été formé en 1997 suite à une rencontre de ses deux membres fondateurs dans une bibliothèque, où ils cachaient tous deux des vinyles dans leur pantalon. Ils sortiront leur premier album These Are Our Children l'année d'après.\nDean Honer s'impliquera dans un collectif All seeing I, dans le même temps Jarrod Gosling produira Add N to (X).\nIl fallut cependant attendre 2003 pour voir la sortie de l'album qui les rendit célèbres, Neveroddoreven avec le single de la pub Toyota Yaris, Hey Mrs, et une reprise de Daydream de The Wallace Collection, single utilisé pour la publicité française \"Les produits Laitiers - Des Sensations Pures\", mais aussi \"Heaven\" pour la publicité CIDIL.\nParticipant à des festivals au Royaume-Uni et en Europe, le groupe sort un troisième album, A Dense Swarm of Ancient Stars en 2009.",

They formed in 1997 and released their debut album These Are Our Children. In 2001, they signed to Instant Karma/Sony Records and released the single 'Daydream In Blue' which became a UK Top 20 hit. The song has since been used in numerous TV ad campaigns and in 2007 was sampled heavily by Chicago rap artist Lupe Fiasco (who simply replaced the vocoder parts of the song with rap). The band's sophomore album, Neveroddoreven, followed in 2004. This featured two further singles, 'Who Is She' and 'Hey Mrs'; that same year, the feature film Shaun Of The Dead used I Monster's \"The Blue Wrath\" over the opening credits. In March of 2009, the band released their third album, A Dense Swarm Of Ancient Stars. As part of Platipus Records' Art Of Chill series, I Monster mixed a 2-CD set, 'Art Of Chill 6 : Mixed by I Monster', which was released November 16 2009. In addition to their music being featured on several U.S. TV series over the past year, the band is currently gearing up to release albums by two separate spin-off groups, Skywatchers and People Soup. The band have produced the new album 'Credo' by legendary Sheffield band The Human League, which was released on Wall Of Sound in March 2011. The band are currently working on their latest album (set for release in 2012) and Jarrod will be releasing his progressive rock album under the name of Regal Worm in June 2012. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/I+Monster\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, due to Honer being involved with hitmakers All Seeing I, it was not until 2001 that they released their first single, \"Daydream in Blue\", a remix of The Gunter Kallmann Choir's version of The Wallace Collection's \"Daydream\". The song was originally released on 7\" on Honer's own record label Cercle Records, which he founded with Add N to (X)'s Barry Seven. It was later re-released with a new mix on Instant Karma (in association with their own label Twins of Evil); which has also released material from Kings Have Long Arms and Mu Chan Clan. The song also featured on episode 3 of season 1 in the BBC Television television drama Hustle. The track peaked at #20 in the UK Singles Chart in June 2001.\nThey released their acclaimed second album Neveroddoreven in 2003, which was re-released with a new sleeve in 2004. The members are regular guest DJs across the country and have played live shows in London and at various European music festivals. Part of the live band is made up of Fred de Fred and Marion Benoist from The Lovers, on guitar and vocals respectively.\nIn 2007, I Monster started collaborating with Finnish pop artist, HK119, for her second album. The resulting project, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control was released in September 2008 on One Little Indian Records, and saw I Monster co-write and co-produce over three quarters of the album. This collaboration came from Dean Honers previous role as a remixer for HK119's debut single, \"Pick Me Up\", from her debut eponymous album in 2006.\nIn 2009, the band released the follow-up to Neveroddoreven, titled A Dense Swarm of Ancient Stars.\nIn 2011, the band produced The Human League's Credo, its first album in 10 years.\nThe band's music also been used in a number of films such as Shaun of the Dead, Riders (Steal), the snowboard video \"From _______ with Love\" (Mack Dawg Productions), and has been sampled by hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco on his second single, \"Daydreamin'\". It was also used in the Ford Focus ST advertisement in the UK, and was also translated into other languages (for example, Turkish) for use in other European countries.\nThe \"Glamour Puss\" remix of their song \"Hey Mrs.\" was used in television commercials for Absolut Vodka and television series Eureka.\n\"These Are Our Children\" was used several times on the Australian television series Underbelly; and was subsequently released as part of the Underbelly soundtrack. It was also used as background music in episode 5 of the ITV drama Married Single Other. The song \"Heaven\" was used in the introduction to the TV show Numb3rs in episode 21, season 5.",
