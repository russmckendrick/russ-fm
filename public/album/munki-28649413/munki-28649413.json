      "biography": "The Jesus and Mary Chain are a chaotic, noisy post-punk quartet formed in Scotland, blending the Beach Boys' sunny pop with the Velvet Underground's black-leather cool. Brothers Jim Reid and William Reid, from East Kilbride, Glasgow, Scotland were the primary songwriters. \"The JAMC\" released a constant string of albums, singles and EPs until their demise in 1998. Having influenced many post-punk and noise rock bands, the group finally reunited in 2007. The initial line-up, formed in 1983, was augmented by bassist Douglas Hart and drummer Bobby Gillespie. Gillespie played standing up in the manner of The Velvet Underground's Maureen \"Moe\" Tucker.\n\nJAMC's early gigs have become the stuff of legend in underground circles. Playing in front of small audiences, the band earned their notoriety by playing very short gigs, some lasting no more than ten minutes and consisting of a constant wall of feedback and distortion. The group became known as well for playing with their backs to the audience and refusing to speak to them. Many shows culminated with the Reids trashing their equipment, which was often followed by the audience rioting. All of this delighted manager and Creation Records boss Alan McGee, who obviously found it very easy to get attention for the band, as well as aliened more commercially-minded music business figures.\n\nTheir debut single, \"Upside Down\", came out in 1984 on Creation, but they signed to the WEA-backed Blanco y Negro the following year. Said label released their debut album, titled 'Psychocandy', which fused together the Reid's two primary influences, the guitar noise and avant-garde rock of The Velvet Underground with the 60s pop leanings of Phil Spector and The Beach Boys. It included songs such as the indie sensation \"Just Like Honey\". The record divided many music fans due to its deliberately abrasive sound yet still received positive critical reviews and is now considered a landmark recording in the history of alternative music. \n\nGillespie left the band before the next album, 'Darklands, came out, going on to front Primal Scream. He was briefly replaced by John Moore (later of Black Box Recorder), before former Biff Bang Pow! drummer Dave Evans. The aforementioned 'Darklands' also received supportive reviews, and it showed a less noisy and more contemplative sound that was welcomed by both many post-punk fans and many mainstream rock fans. Notable songs from that period include \"April Skies\" and \"Happy When It Rains\".\n\nAlbums\n# Psychocandy (November 1985)\n# Darklands (September 1987)\n# Automatic (September 1989)\n# Honey's Dead (March 1992)\n# Stoned & Dethroned (1994)\n# Munki (June 1998)\n# Damage and Joy (2017)\n# Glasgow Eyes (2024)\n\nPlus the following - (sessions, singles, b-sides, live recordings et cetera)\n\n# Barbed Wire Kisses (April 1988)\n# The Sound of Speed (1993)\n# Hate Rock N' Roll (1995)\n# 21 Singles (2002)\n# BBC Live in Concert (2003)\n# The Complete John Peel Sessions (2003)\n# The Power of Negative Thinking: B-Sides & Rarities (2008)\n\nFor the iconic indie label Sub Pop, the band recorded 1998's 'Munki' album, which would turn out to be their last before splitting the following year. The album is often thought of as sounding 'divided' due to the Reids' crumbling relationship. Jim Reid has recalled: \"Me and William weren't really getting along at all. That last year we barely even spoke. 'Munki' is one of my favorite albums, but it was really divided. William would go into the studio with the rest of the band and record while I wasn't there, and then I'd go in with them when William wasn't there.\"\nWilliam Reid then recorded as the artist Lazycame. Brother Jim formed the band Freeheat, which disbanded in 2003. Jim Reid is currently recording solo material and he has, to date, recorded and released one single Song For A Secret which was released on Transistor Records.\n\nLike some of their influences such as Dee Dee Ramone, Lee Hazelwood, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, throughout their career the boys were rumored to have ongoing substance abuse issues, which may have contributed to their notoriety. They reportedly dabbled in regular use of things like amphetamines and heroin, which made for lyrical reference in songs like Some Candy Talking and the album title Stoned & Dethroned. \n\nDespite not having huge commercial success, they've gone on to influence a range of other music groups such as Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Butthole Surfers, My Bloody Valentine, and Spacemen 3.\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain reunited to play at the Coachella Festival on April 27, 2007, followed by two more shows in Spain at the Summercase Festival. More shows followed in late 2007 and early 2008 in London.\n\nCalling themselves 'Sister Vanilla' an LP, Little Pop Rock, was released in 2007 and reunites the brothers along with their sister, Linda, singing on most tracks. \n\nOther personnel;\nRichard Thomas (drums 1988-1990)\nBen Lurie (bass/rhythm guitar/backing vocals 1989-1998)\nSteve Monti (drums 1990-1995)\nMatthew Parkin (bass 1992)\nBarry Blackler (drums 1992)\nNick Sanderson (drums 1993-1998)\nMark Crozer (rhythm guitar 2007-now)\nLoz Colbert (drums 2007-now)\n\nJAMC singer Jim Reid is name-checked in the 2017 song \"Lollipop (Ode to Jim)\" by Canadian band Alvvays which begins \"I saw Jim Reid in the corridor..\" and contains other allusions to JAMC themes.\n\nhttp://thejesusandmarychain.uk.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jesus+and+Mary+Chain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "When it was announced that a major label would not be releasing The Jesus and Mary Chain’s sixth album despite consistently increasing sales for all five previous efforts, it seemed that something was amiss. There was further cause for concern when the Reid siblings began assigning individual writing credit to songs after a literal lifetime of collaboration. But the surest sign that all was not well in JAMC Land came when Jim Reid began conducting all interviews with bassist Ben Lurie instead of brother William.\n\nThe band tried to put on a brave face. Freed from corporate contracts, they could return as prodigal sons to Creation Records, the UK indie they had helped launch in 1984 and was now flush thanks to the success of another sibling act, Oasis. The split songwriting was explained away as part of an aborted double album concept about the history of rock ’n’ roll. And as far as interviews go, Jim always did most of the talking anyhow.\n\nBut no matter how they doth protest, the William-penned lyrics to lead single “Cracking Up”—“Some said I was a freak… They said I was weak… They said I was incomplete”—were enough to merit a wellness check, something Jim acknowledged in an interview with MTV where he said, “Mentally, its been a bit like Vietnam for William over the last couple of years.”\n\nHe also suggested in another interview that his brother’s issues stemmed from his on-and-off relationship with Hope Sandoval, the Mazzy Star singer whose appearance on <i>Stoned & Dethroned</i>’s standout single, “Sometimes Always”, gave The Jesus and Mary Chain their best-selling album. Sandoval returns on <i>Munki</i>, this time sounding more succubus than chanteuse on the oddly trip-hop indebted “Perfume”.\n\nThere are other new sonic spaces explored on the album. Opener “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll” deploys horns, a first for JAMC, in a manner not dissimilar to how Phil Spector added sax and organ to the Ramones’ “Do You Remember Rock ’n’ Roll Radio?” Meanwhile, “Moe Tucker” pays tribute to The Velvet Underground’s enigmatic drummer with vocals by the Reids’ sister, Linda, as well as a rather un-VU Moog synthesiser part. And speaking of surprises, could anyone have guessed that the JAMC’s final album before splitting up for almost a decade would feature a drum solo?",

After leaving Blanco y Negro, the Reid brothers signed to Sub Pop in the U.S. and Creation, who had released their debut single \"Upside Down\" in 1984, in the UK. The origin of the album title, according to Ben Lurie in an interview with Spin magazine, was that they \"wanted an un-Mary Chain-like title...It doesn't mean anything. It's just a word. Misspelled on purpose.\" In an interview with The Herald, Jim said that their sister Linda suggested it. This was the band's final studio album before their 8-year breakup from October 1999 to June 2007.\n\nThe album features an appearance from Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star, who had previously duetted with the band on the single \"Sometimes Always\", and includes the singles \"I Hate Rock 'n' Roll\" (released in 1995), \"Cracking Up\" and \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll.\"\n\nThe album is often thought of as sounding \"divided\" due to the Reids' crumbling relationship, Jim Reid recalls: \"Me and William weren't really getting along at all. That last year we barely even spoke. Munki is one of my favorite albums, but it was really divided. William would go into the studio with the rest of the band and record while I wasn't there, and then I'd go in with them when William wasn't there.\"\n\nAccording to an interview in Alternative Press magazine, Jim said that \"I Hate Rock 'n' Roll\" was written by his brother \"out of sheer frustration with the kind of crap we have to deal with in the music business.\" To counterbalance these sentiments, Jim wrote \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" because \"I thought it left  kind of negative - I felt it was only half the story.\" In the same issue of Alt Press, Munki was rated a perfect 5 out 5. Most other reviews, like those from Allmusic and Rolling Stone linked on this page, were less enthusiastic.\n\nMunki peaked at No. 47 in the UK album charts, the band's first studio album not to make the Top 40.\n\nPersonnel\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain\n    Jim Reid - vocals (tracks 1 to 4, 6, 8, 10, 13 to 15), guitar, production\n    William Reid - vocals (tracks 1 to 3, 5, 7, 9 to 14, 16 to 17), guitar, production\n    Ben Lurie - guitar, bass\n    Nick Sanderson - drums\n\nAdditional personnel\n    Sister Vanilla - vocals (track 5)\n    Sean Lebon - vocals (track 5)\n    Hope Sandoval - vocals (track 6)\n    Terry Edwards - horns\n    Dick Meaney - mixing (tracks 1 to 7, 9 to 12, 14, 16, 17)\n    Alan Moulder - mixing (tracks 8, 13, 15)\n    Nick Addison - additional mixing (track 6)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jesus+and+Mary+Chain/Munki\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
