      "biography": "Dog Eat Dog made its big breakthrough in 1994 with the hit single No Fronts and the album All Boro Kings. The story behind Dog Eat Dog started a little earlier though...\n\nDog Eat Dog has actually been around since 1990, when Dave Neabore  and Sean Kilkenny  decided to form a band of their own after previously playing in Mucky Pup. A short while later Dave and Sean were accompanied by John Connor  who was to act as the voice of the band and Dan Nastasi, who would play the second guitar. Besides these four guys, Dog Eat Dog went through a whole list of drummers, before finally being joined by Brandon Finley , who remains the drummer of the band today.\n\nIn 1993, after signing with Roadrunner Records, Dog Eat Dog released their first EP called Warrant. The EP was, as a joke, named after the band Warrant, who had just released an album called Dog Eat Dog. The release of the Warrant EP made it possible for the band to tour the Eastcoast of the US and their first overseas tour, supporting the Bad Brains in the U.K. and 7 Seconds & Big Drill Car in Europe.\n\nThings really started rolling with the release of the All Boro Kings album in 1994. After the release of this successful album, which eventually sold more than 500,000 copies, Dog Eat Dog went for a second European tour supporting Biohazard together with Downset. Besides the hit single No Fronts the album featured classic Dog Eat Dog songs, such as Who's the King?, Pull My Finger and If These Are The Good Times. The album and hit single, produced by the late Jam Master Jay, resulted in Dog Eat Dog winning an MTV Europe video music award in 1995 for breakthrough artist, beating Alanis Morisette, Portishead and Weezer in the process.\n\nIn between touring just about the whole world, Dog Eat Dog went back into the studio in 1996 to record their second full length album. Play Games as it was named, saw them working together with such esteemed artists as The RZA from The Wutang Clan and Ronnie James Dio from Black Sabbath. The new album contained famous tracks like Rocky, Isms and Step Right In. With the release of Play Games, Dog Eat Dog went on doing what they do best: touring and playing live shows! During this very successful time, they found themselves playing with bands such as Rage Against The Machine, No Doubt, Sepultura, as well as HUGE acts like Ozzy, KISS, and Metallica.\n\nIn 1999, after three years of touring, Dog Eat Dog went back into the recording studio to make their third album Amped. The album contained the hit single Expect The Unexpected as well as other popular songs, such as Get Up and Whateverman. This third album saw the band trying out new music styles, including reggae and funk mixed with hip hop and punk. A short while after the release of the first single, Dog Eat Dog split with their record label, Roadrunner Records, having been disappointed by their support of the band and the new album.\n\nNever a band that gives up, Dog Eat Dog continued doing what they do best, playing live. Since 1999 Dog Eat Dog has been touring through Europe and Asia, with several tours each year. So far the band has played in 38 countries and counting! In 2005, the band signed a new record deal and completed their fourth album. The new CD, titled \"Walk With Me\", is out now on Wanted Records. Dog Eat Dog are playing the new songs, such as M.I.L.F., ESB, Walk With Me and Undivided along with all their classic hits at European festivals and clubs. Dog Eat Dog is back, so Expect the Unexpected! \n\nFor more information, photos, videos, free music and the latest news visit www.dogeatdog.nl <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dog+Eat+Dog\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Dog Eat Dog began writing the songs that would become their first full-length album. Titled All Boro Kings, it was released on May 24, 1994. All Boro Kings also brought the saxophone into the foreground of their songs. Tracks like \"If These Are Good Times\", \"Who's the King\", and \"No Fronts\" contained the trademark saxophone sound that the band would be known for. Darryl Jenifer of the Bad Brains also made a vocal appearance on \"Who's the King\".\n\nWith the release of the album, Nastasi decided he could no longer tour for long periods of time because of family and business obligations. The band hired Parris Mayhew of the Cro-Mags to temporarily fill the position with the intention of bringing back Nastasi for local touring and recording.\n\nWith a new record in stores, the band toured Europe, once again opening for Biohazard. This proved to be a tremendous success for Dog Eat Dog. They received critical acclaim for both the new album and their live performances. All Boro Kings went on to sell over 600,000 records worldwide. The band also saw their videos in heavy rotation on MTV Europe. In December 1994, Dog Eat Dog's video for \"No Fronts\" was featured on an episode of MTV's Beavis and Butthead, where the animated duo referred to the band as \"a bunch of butt-munches.\"\n\nAfter the tour, Mayhew returned to directing videos and forming his new band, White Devil. The band contacted DeBacker, Neabore's replacement in Mucky Pup, with an offer for him to fill-in on guitar on their upcoming tour. Being familiar with the material, he accepted. It was then that Maltby also decided to part ways with the band for personal reasons. He later put together a short-lived band called The Shining Path, with Jenifer of the Bad Brains and the members of the Roguish Armament. After many auditions, Brandon Finley, known for his drumming with Chuck Brown, Queen Latifah, Urban Blight, and Chris Haskett of the Rollins Band, was hired. Mueller was also brought on as a full-time saxophone player. The band had always stood out from other hardcore bands because of their addition to a saxophone player. For a good portion of their live shows, as well as their two studio albums, Mueller had held the position. While the albums would list Mueller as a guest musician, he had never been considered a full-time member of the band until now.\n\nMTV would prove to be one factor that would help the band achieve its status. After the surprise hit \"Who's the King\", the band collaborated with Run–D.M.C. member Jam-Master Jay on a remix of their hit song \"No Fronts\". The single entered the top ten on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 9, and the video was in heavy rotation on MTV UK. On Thanksgiving Night 1995, they were voted Breakthrough Artists of the Year at the MTV Europe Music Awards, as part of a viewer's choice program and were presented the award by Patsy Kensit and Michael Hutchence of INXS. In winning the award, they defeated the likes of Alanis Morissette, Weezer, H-Blockx, and Portishead. Europe continued to be a large part of the band's fan base. While they were relegated to small clubs at home in America, they were playing festivals and arena-sized shows in Europe, the biggest being the Dynamo Open-Air festival in 1995. They also charted on Europe's top forty heavy metal charts, while radio stations at home rarely acknowledged them. When the band returned home from Europe, Nastasi decided not to return from his hiatus and the decision was made to keep DeBacker as the full-time guitar player. After leaving Dog Eat Dog, Nastasi recorded two albums, Trim the Fat and Ule Tide, under the name Nastasee. Both albums and their respective tours contained members from both Dog Eat Dog and Mucky Pup. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dog+Eat+Dog/All+Boro+Kings\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
