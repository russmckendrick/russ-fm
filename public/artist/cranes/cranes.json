  "biography": "Cranes is a shoegaze/dream pop group fronted by Alison Shaw and formed in 1986.  They were originally based on the south coast of England in Portsmouth.\n\nThe band released their first album on vinyl, Self Non Self in July 1989.  The intensity of that album garnered very good reviews and caught the attention of John Peel, who picked up on the album right away, with the group recording a session for him in the album's first week of release. Shortly afterwards they signed to the label Dedicated (which also became home to Spiritualized and Beth Orton) and went on to record their EP \"Espero\" in 1990, with the album \"Wings of Joy\" following a year later.  The release of \"Wings of Joy\" caught the attention of Robert Smith of The Cure who picked the Cranes to open for them on their world tour in 1992. They then went on to record the albums \"Forever\" (1993), \"Loved\" (1994), \"La Tragedie d'Oreste et Electre\" (1995), and \"Population Four\" (1997). \n\nAfter a 4 year break, Cranes re-emerged on their own independent label Dadaphonic to release \"Future Songs\" (2001) and \"Particles & Waves\" (2004), which saw the band heading in a more electronic direction while retaining the trademark sound of previous releases.  In January 2007 the band released a download only album, \"Live at Amsterdam Paradiso,\" originally recorded in 1991.  The show captures the darker, heavier days of the early Cranes and is available only via www.dadaphonic.co.uk. \n\nIn 2008 Cranes albums \"Wings of Joy', 'Forever' and 'Loved'  were re-issued by Cherry Red Records, www.cherryred.co.uk as part of their series of 'influential artists' re-releases.\n\nIn October 2008 Cranes released their self titled album 'Cranes', to which they did a supporting tour. After that there was the odd performance here and there up until 2012 after which Cranes fell silent again.\n\nIn 2022 they re-emerged with several newly opened social media accounts to which the purpose soon became clear: Cranes have reformed in their original nineties line-up to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the \"Forever\" album with some gigs in the UK (see events) and they are currently rehearsing.\nIn June 2023 they also released a 'new' album: their previously unreleased  \"Peel Sessions 1989​-​1990\" which you can get on their Bandcamp site (see Linktree below)  both digitally and on CD/Vinyl.\n\nCurrent members\nAlison Shaw – vocals, bass guitar, acoustic guitar (1985–1997, 2000–present)\nJim Shaw – guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, drums (1985–1997, 2000–present)\nMark Francombe – guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, spanner (1989–1997, 2022-present)\nMatt Cope – guitar (1989–1997, 2022-present)\n\nFormer members:\nKevin Dunford – lead guitar (1988–1989)\nPaul Smith – guitar, keyboards (1995–1997, 2000–2012)\nManu Ross – drums (1996–1997)\nBen Baxter – bass guitar (2000–2012)\nJon Callender – drums (2000–2007)\nJon Mattock – drums (2008–2012)\n\nCranes official  Linktree: https://linktr.ee/cranesofficial <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cranes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
