      "biography": "Wishbone Ash are a British rock band which achieved success in the early and mid-1970s. Their popular records included Wishbone Ash (1970), Argus (1972), There's the Rub (1974), and New England (1976). They were one of the first bands to use twin lead guitars.\nWishbone Ash are considered to be one of the major innovators of the harmony twin lead guitar format. Their contributions helped Andy Powell and Ted Turner to be voted \"Two of the Ten Most Important Guitarists in Rock History\" (Traffic magazine 1989), and to appear in the \"Top 20 Guitarists Of All Time\" (Rolling Stone). Melody Maker (1972) described Powell and Turner as \"the most interesting two guitar team since the days when Beck and Page graced The Yardbirds\".\nFormed in Torquay, Devon, in 1969, out of the ashes of trio The Empty Vessels (originally known as The Torinoes, later briefly being renamed Tanglewood in 1969), which had been formed by Wishbone Ash's founding member Martin Turner (bass & vocals) in 1963 and complemented by Steve Upton (drums and percussion) in 1966. The original Wishbone Ash line-up was completed by guitarists/vocalists Andy Powell and Ted Turner. In 1974, Ted Turner left the band, and was replaced by Laurie Wisefield. The band continued on with strong critical and commercial success until 1980.\nAfter revolving line-ups featuring former members from King Crimson, Trapeze, and Uriah Heep, Wisefield left in 1985. In 1987, however, the original line-up reunited for several albums - Nouveau Calls, Here to Hear and Strange Affair - until 1990, when Upton quit the band. After Martin Turner was replaced in 1991, the band recorded The Ash Live in Chicago, before Ted Turner left in 1993.",

It was named \"Album of the Year\" in the 1972 year-end issue of Sounds magazine. The album features a blend of progressive rock, folk, and hard rock, and is considered a landmark album in the progression of twin-lead guitar harmonization later adopted by bands such as Thin Lizzy and Iron Maiden. The sound engineer on Argus was Martin Birch, who also worked with Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and other rock/metal bands. \nThe bulk of the melodies and lyrics were provided by bassist/lead vocalist Martin Turner, although all members contributed to the song arrangements.\n\nWith the success of 'Argus' (the album reached #3 in the UK charts) Wishbone Ash became one of the most popular live attractions of the day.\n\nA mixture of medieval lyricism and tight musicianship, 'Argus is not a concept album, but is an album of strong, interesting songs.  Fans agree that 'Argus' is the classic Wishbone Ash sound and that the band have not bettered this with any of their subsequent releases. Their twin \"harmony lead guitars\" are masterfully backed up with a tight rhythm section. \nTheir follow-up \"Pilgrimage\" album (released in September 1971) did reach #14 in the UK charts.\n\nIn 2002, an expanded CD was released, featuring a remix (by Martin Turner) of the original album as well as 3 live tracks from the EP Live from Memphis promotional EP, recorded in the studios of WMC-FM.\n\nIn 2007, a deluxe edition was released. This included the 1972 mix as well as additional BBC Session tracks.\n\nIn 2008, Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash released a new studio recording of Argus. Andy Powell's incarnation of Wishbone Ash also released its own live version of the album entitled Argus \"Then Again\" Live. Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash played the entire piece live for the first time in February 2008 – the first time any incarnation of the band had done so – and embarked on a lengthy Argus tour. Andy Powell's band followed suit and added the full piece to their repertoire for several shows. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wishbone+Ash/Argus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
