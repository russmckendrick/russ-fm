  "biography": "Queensrÿche are an American heavy metal band. They formed in 1980 in Bellevue, Washington, out of the local band the Mob. The band has released 15 studio albums, one EP, and several DVDs, and continues to tour and record. The original lineup consisted of guitarists Michael Wilton and Chris DeGarmo, drummer Scott Rockenfield, bassist Eddie Jackson, and lead vocalist Geoff Tate.\n\nQueensrÿche has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including over 6 million albums in the United States. They are considered one of the leaders of the progressive metal scene of the mid-to-late 1980s, and often referred to as one of the \"Big Three\" of the genre, along with Dream Theater and Fates Warning. The band received worldwide acclaim after the release of their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime, which is often considered one of the greatest heavy metal concept albums of all time. Their follow-up release, Empire, released in 1990, was also very successful and included the hit single \"Silent Lucidity\". The band has received three Grammy Award nominations for songs from both albums. In 1998, drummer Rockenfield received an individual Grammy nomination.\n\nAlso in 1998, guitarist and primary songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons, returning briefly in 2003 to write and record the Tribe album. Over the years, his replacements have been Kelly Gray, Mike Stone, and Parker Lundgren. Following a highly publicized backstage altercation before a show in São Paulo, Brazil, in April 2012, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with then-Crimson Glory singer Todd La Torre. In response to his dismissal, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005 to 2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The ruling in the preliminary injunction was that both parties were allowed to use the name Queensrÿche until a court ruling or a settlement decided who would get to use the name. A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014, in which founding members Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson were awarded the rights to the band trademark, continuing to play with the lineup that additionally includes singer La Torre and guitarist Lundgren.\n\nDuring the time, both parties could use the name Queensrÿche, Tate created his own lineup featuring former guitarist Gray and musicians from bands including Blue Öyster Cult, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake, Dio, AC/DC and Quiet Riot. This version of Queensrÿche with Geoff Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23, 2013, while Queensrÿche (with La Torre replacing Tate) released their eponymous album on June 24 and 25, 2013 (European and American release date, respectively). Both bands toured in 2013 and 2014.\n\nFull article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensrÿche\n\nStudio albums\nThe Warning (1984)\nRage for Order (1986)\nOperation: Mindcrime (1988)\nEmpire (1990)\nPromised Land (1994)\nHear in the Now Frontier (1997)\nQ2K (1999)\nTribe (2003)\nOperation: Mindcrime II (2006)\nTake Cover (2007)\nAmerican Soldier (2009)\nDedicated to Chaos (2011)\nQueensrÿche (2013)\nCondition Hüman (2015)\nThe Verdict (2019)\nDigital Noise Alliance (2022)\n\nGeoff Tate's Queensrÿche\nFrequency Unknown (2013) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Queensr%C3%BFche\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "profile": "[i]Queensrÿche[/i] are a progressive metal band from Seattle, Washington, USA. They began as [i]The Mob[/i] during 1981, formed by guitarist [a=Michael Wilton], drummer [a=Scott Rockenfield], guitarist [a=Chris DeGarmo] and bassist [a=Eddie Jackson]. Without a singer, they recruited [a=Geoff Tate] to sing for them at a local rock festival. At the time, Tate was in another band called [i]Babylon[/i].  After [i]Babylon[/i] broke up, Tate performed a few shows with [i]The Mob[/i], but left the group. In 1981, [i]The Mob[/i] put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape. Once again they asked Tate, who was in another band [a=Myth (10)], to do the vocals and they recorded four songs “Queen of the Reich”, “Nightrider”, “Blinded”, and “The Lady Wore Black”.\r\n\r\nSince the name “[i]The Mob[/i]” was not available, they decided to name the band [i]Queensrÿche[/i] after the first song on their demo tape, “Queen of the Reich”. In 1983, [i]Queensrÿche[/i] released their demo tape as a self-titled EP \"[i][m=70727][/i]\". Tate agreed to leave [i]Myth[/i] and become [i]Queensrÿche[/i]’s permanent lead singer.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, guitarist and primary songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons. Over the years, his replacements have been [a=Kelly Gray], [a=Mike Stone (5)], and [a=Parker Lundgren], respectively.\r\n\r\nIn a band meeting on April 12th 2012, which Tate did not attend, the band members discussed outsourcing the fanclub and merchandising, resulting in the firing of Tate’s stepdaughter, Miranda, from running the band’s fan club. Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson also fired the band manager, [a=Susan Tate], because of ongoing “arguments and division” over decisions and “feelings that Susan Tate was not working on the behalf of the band as a whole.” On April 14th 2012, before the soundcheck for a show at the HSBC Arena in São Paulo, Brazil, Tate inquired with Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson why they had fired his wife and stepdaughter, and the other band members asked Tate questions about the deal with [i]Zoetifex Studios[/i]. Following that São Paulo incident, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with [a=Crimson Glory] singer [a=Todd La Torre].\r\n\r\nOn June 12th 2012, Tate and his wife filed a lawsuit in a Seattle court against his former bandmates, claiming that he was illegally fired from the band. They also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent both the plaintiffs and the defendants from using the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] name. On July 13th 2012 the Washington state superior court defeated this motion, as well as a motion for a preliminary summary judgment filed by the defendants. The court ruled that both parties may use the brand [i]Queensrÿche[/i] until the next court date. As a result of the judge’s preliminary verdict, there were two versions of [i]Queensrÿche[/i] for two years.\r\n\r\nGeoff Tate fronted version of [a=Queensrÿche (2)] released their album '[m=567309]' on April 23rd 2013.\r\nMeanwhile the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] line-up comprised of Todd La Torre, Michael Wilton, Parker Lundgren, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield released their new self-titled album '[m=568285]' on June 24th 2013. \r\n\r\nIt was revealed to the public on April 28th 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] trademark and that Tate received the rights to [a=Operation: Mindcrime].",

        "profile": "[i]Queensrÿche[/i] are a progressive metal band from Seattle, Washington, USA. They began as [i]The Mob[/i] during 1981, formed by guitarist [a=Michael Wilton], drummer [a=Scott Rockenfield], guitarist [a=Chris DeGarmo] and bassist [a=Eddie Jackson]. Without a singer, they recruited [a=Geoff Tate] to sing for them at a local rock festival. At the time, Tate was in another band called [i]Babylon[/i].  After [i]Babylon[/i] broke up, Tate performed a few shows with [i]The Mob[/i], but left the group. In 1981, [i]The Mob[/i] put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape. Once again they asked Tate, who was in another band [a=Myth (10)], to do the vocals and they recorded four songs “Queen of the Reich”, “Nightrider”, “Blinded”, and “The Lady Wore Black”.\r\n\r\nSince the name “[i]The Mob[/i]” was not available, they decided to name the band [i]Queensrÿche[/i] after the first song on their demo tape, “Queen of the Reich”. In 1983, [i]Queensrÿche[/i] released their demo tape as a self-titled EP \"[i][m=70727][/i]\". Tate agreed to leave [i]Myth[/i] and become [i]Queensrÿche[/i]’s permanent lead singer.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, guitarist and primary songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons. Over the years, his replacements have been [a=Kelly Gray], [a=Mike Stone (5)], and [a=Parker Lundgren], respectively.\r\n\r\nIn a band meeting on April 12th 2012, which Tate did not attend, the band members discussed outsourcing the fanclub and merchandising, resulting in the firing of Tate’s stepdaughter, Miranda, from running the band’s fan club. Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson also fired the band manager, [a=Susan Tate], because of ongoing “arguments and division” over decisions and “feelings that Susan Tate was not working on the behalf of the band as a whole.” On April 14th 2012, before the soundcheck for a show at the HSBC Arena in São Paulo, Brazil, Tate inquired with Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson why they had fired his wife and stepdaughter, and the other band members asked Tate questions about the deal with [i]Zoetifex Studios[/i]. Following that São Paulo incident, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with [a=Crimson Glory] singer [a=Todd La Torre].\r\n\r\nOn June 12th 2012, Tate and his wife filed a lawsuit in a Seattle court against his former bandmates, claiming that he was illegally fired from the band. They also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent both the plaintiffs and the defendants from using the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] name. On July 13th 2012 the Washington state superior court defeated this motion, as well as a motion for a preliminary summary judgment filed by the defendants. The court ruled that both parties may use the brand [i]Queensrÿche[/i] until the next court date. As a result of the judge’s preliminary verdict, there were two versions of [i]Queensrÿche[/i] for two years.\r\n\r\nGeoff Tate fronted version of [a=Queensrÿche (2)] released their album '[m=567309]' on April 23rd 2013.\r\nMeanwhile the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] line-up comprised of Todd La Torre, Michael Wilton, Parker Lundgren, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield released their new self-titled album '[m=568285]' on June 24th 2013. \r\n\r\nIt was revealed to the public on April 28th 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the [i]Queensrÿche[/i] trademark and that Tate received the rights to [a=Operation: Mindcrime].",

      "bio_content": "Queensrÿche are an American heavy metal band. They formed in 1980 in Bellevue, Washington, out of the local band the Mob. The band has released 15 studio albums, one EP, and several DVDs, and continues to tour and record. The original lineup consisted of guitarists Michael Wilton and Chris DeGarmo, drummer Scott Rockenfield, bassist Eddie Jackson, and lead vocalist Geoff Tate.\n\nQueensrÿche has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including over 6 million albums in the United States. They are considered one of the leaders of the progressive metal scene of the mid-to-late 1980s, and often referred to as one of the \"Big Three\" of the genre, along with Dream Theater and Fates Warning. The band received worldwide acclaim after the release of their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime, which is often considered one of the greatest heavy metal concept albums of all time. Their follow-up release, Empire, released in 1990, was also very successful and included the hit single \"Silent Lucidity\". The band has received three Grammy Award nominations for songs from both albums. In 1998, drummer Rockenfield received an individual Grammy nomination.\n\nAlso in 1998, guitarist and primary songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons, returning briefly in 2003 to write and record the Tribe album. Over the years, his replacements have been Kelly Gray, Mike Stone, and Parker Lundgren. Following a highly publicized backstage altercation before a show in São Paulo, Brazil, in April 2012, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with then-Crimson Glory singer Todd La Torre. In response to his dismissal, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005 to 2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The ruling in the preliminary injunction was that both parties were allowed to use the name Queensrÿche until a court ruling or a settlement decided who would get to use the name. A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014, in which founding members Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson were awarded the rights to the band trademark, continuing to play with the lineup that additionally includes singer La Torre and guitarist Lundgren.\n\nDuring the time, both parties could use the name Queensrÿche, Tate created his own lineup featuring former guitarist Gray and musicians from bands including Blue Öyster Cult, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake, Dio, AC/DC and Quiet Riot. This version of Queensrÿche with Geoff Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23, 2013, while Queensrÿche (with La Torre replacing Tate) released their eponymous album on June 24 and 25, 2013 (European and American release date, respectively). Both bands toured in 2013 and 2014.\n\nFull article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensrÿche\n\nStudio albums\nThe Warning (1984)\nRage for Order (1986)\nOperation: Mindcrime (1988)\nEmpire (1990)\nPromised Land (1994)\nHear in the Now Frontier (1997)\nQ2K (1999)\nTribe (2003)\nOperation: Mindcrime II (2006)\nTake Cover (2007)\nAmerican Soldier (2009)\nDedicated to Chaos (2011)\nQueensrÿche (2013)\nCondition Hüman (2015)\nThe Verdict (2019)\nDigital Noise Alliance (2022)\n\nGeoff Tate's Queensrÿche\nFrequency Unknown (2013) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Queensr%C3%BFche\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
