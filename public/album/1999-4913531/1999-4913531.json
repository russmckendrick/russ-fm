      "biography": "Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016), more commonly known mononymously as Prince, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona; his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop.\n\nBorn and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, and was also the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career. In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar (known to fans as the \"Love Symbol\") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist.\n\nAfter signing with Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home after his death, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. He also released songs under multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made popular after being covered by other musicians, most notably \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor and \"Manic Monday\" by the Bangles. Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Released posthumously, his demo albums Piano and a Microphone 1983 (2018) and Originals (2019) both received critical acclaim.\n\nPrince sold over 100 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted twice into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)\n\nStudio albums\nFor You (1978)\nPrince (1979)\nDirty Mind (1980)\nControversy (1981)\n1999 (1982)\nPurple Rain (1984)\nAround the World in a Day (1985)\nParade (1986)\nSign o' the Times (1987)\nLovesexy (1988)\nBatman (1989)\nGraffiti Bridge (1990)\nDiamonds and Pearls (1991)\nLove Symbol (1992)\nCome (1994)\nThe Black Album (1994)\nThe Gold Experience (1995)\nChaos and Disorder (1996)\nEmancipation (1996)\nCrystal Ball (1998)\nThe Truth (1998)\nThe Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale (1999)\nRave Un2 the Joy Fantastic (1999)\nThe Rainbow Children (2001)\nOne Nite Alone...

      "editorial_notes": "Heading into his fifth studio album in five years, Prince was already flexing his prolific powers—not just as a solo artist, but also as the mastermind behind several other Minneapolis groups, all of which allowed the Purple One to express his seemingly boundless creativity: In 1982 alone, Prince oversaw the release of Vanity 6’s self-titled debut album, played extensively on The Time’s sophomore hit <i>What Time Is It?</i> and released the double-disc classic <i>1999</i>—a visionary statement that, in many ways, was truly 17 years ahead of its time.\n\nBuilding on the mix of foreboding funk and blunt social statements he employed on 1980’s <i>Dirty Mind</i> and 1981’s <i>Controversy</i>, the future-shocked <i>1999</i> took Prince’s music—and message—to the masses, becoming his first album to land in the Top 10 of the Billboard Album charts. And this party manifesto spawned the singer’s biggest hits to date, including the apocalyptic title tune, the euphoric “Little Red Corvette” and the giddy, bopping, synth-driven “Delirious”.\n\nThe success of those three tracks—in particular “Little Red Corvette” and “Delirious”—would eventually land Prince his <i>Purple Rain</i> movie deal. Yet they’re just the opening tracks on this lengthy classic, which finds Prince’s genius in full flight. <i>1999</i> features the anthemic mantra of “D.M.S.R.”, the conscious soul of “Free”, the jazzy funk of “Lady Cab Driver” and the libidinous lift-off of “International Lover”. But the album also found Prince evolving beyond his one-man-band beginnings, setting the stage for the Revolution era to come on <i>Purple Rain</i>, with Prince getting musical input from such skillful musicians as Lisa Coleman, Wendy Melvoin, Dez Dickerson and Bobby Z. By the end of the millennium, “1999” would be played nonstop—and while it may have seemed in that moment the world had finally caught up to Prince, in truth, he was <i>always</i> a few years ahead of us.",

            "content": "1999 is the fifth album by Prince, released on October 27, 1982. It was his first top ten album on the Billboard 200 charts in the United States (peaking at number 9) and became the fifth best-selling album of 1983. 1999 was Prince's breakthrough album, but his next album Purple Rain would become his most successful.\n\nAccording to the Rolling Stone Album Guide, \"1999 may be Prince's most influential album: Its synth-and-drum machine-heavy arrangements codified the 'Minneapolis sound' that loomed over mid-'80s R&B and pop, not to mention the next two decades' worth of electro, house, and techno.\" In 2003, the TV network VH1 placed 1999 forty-ninth in its list of the greatest albums of all time. The album was also part of Slant Magazine's list \"The 50 Most Essential Pop Albums\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nThe album's critical and commercial success secured Prince a place in the public psyche, and marked the beginning of two years of intense activity which, via massively successful tours, hit singles and a Hollywood movie, would make Prince arguably the biggest musical star on the planet next to Michael Jackson. In 2003, the album was ranked number 163 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\n\nOriginally released on vinyl as a double LP (the first of a number of double sets from Prince), 1999 was cut to a single vinyl edition in some countries; Brazil, for example, opted to issue the release as two separate vinyl albums, 1999 and 1999 II. The original compact disc version of the album was also cut, omitting \"D.M.S.R.\". There is a disclaimer on the back cover of the original compact disc pressing that reads \"To enable the release of 1999 as a single compact disc, the song DMSR has been omitted from the original LP edition\". Later compact disc pressings included the track. Also, on the cassette release, \"Free\" was placed after \"D.M.S.R.\" to end the first side, balancing out the lengths of both sides of the cassette.\n\nThe album's opening title track, \"1999\", was also its first single, initially peaking at 44 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was later re-released, hitting number 12 on the Billboard charts once interest in the album had caught fire with the release of 1999's second single, \"Little Red Corvette\", which peaked at Number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and heralded Prince's rise to superstardom. The music video for the song was significant in itself as one of the first videos by a black artist to receive \"heavy rotation\" airplay on the newly launched music video channel, MTV. The two tracks were later combined as a double A-side single in the UK, peaking at number 2. A third single, \"Delirious\", still managed Top Ten status in the US, but a fourth, \"Let's Pretend We're Married\", got no further than number 52.\n\nWhile \"Little Red Corvette\" helped Prince cross over to the wider rock audience, the rest of the album retains the elements of previous albums and is dominated by funk and synthesizer dance tracks. The album is, however, notable amongst Prince's catalogue for its wide variety of imagery and themes besides the sexual themes that had already become something of a trademark on previous albums. \"Automatic\", extending to almost ten minutes, starts side three of the album with a cocktail of synthesizers and bawdy bondage-inspired lyrical imagery which, transplanted to the music video for the track (with a scene that depicted Prince being tied up and whipped by band-members Lisa Coleman and Jill Jones), was, in 1983, considered too hot for MTV. \"Free\" is a delicate piano ballad expressing patriotism, and how fellow Americans should appreciate their freedom, while \"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)\", an ode to a harsh lover, is the centerpiece of a preoccupation with Computer Age themes that would continue into future albums. This \"computer\" theme is also reflected in the album's instrumentation, with Prince fully embracing the gadgetry and sounds of emergent electro-funk and '80's sequencing technology on tracks like \"Let's Pretend We're Married\" and \"All the Critics Love U in New York\", songs that widen his use of synthesizers and effects and prominently feature his noted uses of the Linn drum machine. Prince himself admitted at the time the movie Blade Runner was an influence on the album's synth sound and look in the music videos for the album.\n\n\nThe album's cover features elements from the front cover of Prince's previous album, Controversy; namely the eyes and the \"Rude Boy\" pin in the \"1999\", the jacket studs in the \"R\" and the smile in the \"P\". The \"I\" in Prince, in addition to being an obvious phallic symbol, also contains the words \"and the Revolution\" written backwards, both acknowledging his backing band and foreshadowing the next four years of his career.\n\nOne particular interesting fact about the ballad \"Free\" was, that fans have created myths that Prince is crying towards the end of the ballad. His voice can be heard getting very choked up around the 3:05 mark. This might be due to the fact that the song is well-meaning and emotional. In 2007, while performing the song Prince was said to have gotten emotional. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Prince/1999\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
