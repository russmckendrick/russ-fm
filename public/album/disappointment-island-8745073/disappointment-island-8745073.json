      "biography": "TTNG (previously known as \"This Town Needs Guns\") are a math rock band originating from Oxford in the United Kingdom. They were formed in 2004, and are currently signed to Sargent House (USA).\nTheir debut full length album, Animals, was released in UK via Big Scary Monsters Recording Company in October 2008 and shortly after in the US via Sargent House Records.\nOver the years the band's musical style has progressed and changed, although the focal point of their style has been the guitar work of Tim Collis interspersed with, at points, highly complex drumming and sparse, melodic bass. Early releases however, featured more distorted chord progressions, as well as a strong focus on the interlinking melodies of both Collis and Smith's guitars. More recently however, the band's music has become more technical; making more use of asymmetrical time signatures and complex accenting between guitar and drums, plus an abandonment of distortion and guitar effects, giving way to more complex melodies. The Sydney Morning Herald describes the band's music as having \"intricate pop guitar work, with a touch of jazz and Spanish influences\".",
