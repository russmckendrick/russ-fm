      "biography": "Depeche Mode are an English Synthpop band founded in 1980, originally from Basildon, Essex, United Kingdom. They are one of the most enduring and successful bands that emerged during the 80s, particularly from the new wave/new romantic era. The band name is derived from a French fashion magazine, Dépêche Mode, which means \"fashion dispatch.\" Depeche Mode are one of the most influential bands in the world, having influenced hundreds of legendary bands like Rammstein, Nine Inch Nails, Linkin Park, Paradise Lost, Marilyn Manson, and Lacuna Coil.\n\nThe band has been highly influential in the electronic dance music scene, especially synthpop, techno, and trance, partly due to their innovative work, recording techniques, and use of sampling. Their most successful album is arguably 1990's Violator, which reached the #2 position in the UK, #7 in the US, and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The band has released a long series of high-charting singles over their three-decades long career. Enjoy the Silence is their most recognized song and one of history's most covered songs.\n\nThe original line-up was Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Vince Clarke. In December 1981, Clarke left the band and later formed Yazoo, The Assembly, and Erasure. Alan Wilder joined the group initially in January 1982 as a live keyboardist but became an official member in December 1982. He left in mid-1995 to fully concentrate on his Recoil project, and the band continued as a trio. In 2010 Wilder re-joined Depeche Mode on stage after 16 years for a performance of Somebody during a show at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nDepeche Mode's origins date back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore, and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards, and Fletcher on bass. Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke, and Fletcher switched to synthesizers. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" and Depeche Mode was born. \n\nWhile playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, approached the band, who proposed a verbal contract. The result was their first single,  Dreaming of Me, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981, reaching number 57 in the UK charts and followed soon by a real contract with Mute.\n\nTo date, Depeche Mode have released:\n15 studio albums: Speak & Spell (1981), A Broken Frame (1982), Construction Time Again (1983), Some Great Reward (1984), Black Celebration (1986), Music For the Masses (1987), Violator (1990), Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993), Ultra (1997), Exciter (2001), Playing the Angel (2005),  Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013), Spirit (2017), and Memento Mori (2023);\n8 compilations: People Are People (1984), The Singles 81-85 (1985), Catching Up with Depeche Mode (1985), Greatest Hits (1987), The Singles 86>98 (1998), Remixes 81-04 (2004), The Best Of Depeche Mode Volume 1 (2006), The Complete Depeche Mode (2006);\n5 live albums: 101 (1989), Songs of Faith and Devotion Live (1993), Recording the Angel (a series of live recordings; 2006), Tour Of The Universe: Barcelona 20/21:11:09 (2009) and Live In Berlin (Soundtrack) (2014) ;\nOver 50 singles:  including Just Can't Get Enough, Everything Counts, People Are People, Master and Servant, Shake the Disease, Stripped, A Question of Time, Strangelove, Never Let Me Down Again, Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth, I Feel You, Walking in My Shoes, In Your Room, Barrel of a Gun, It's No Good, Home, Dream On, Freelove, Precious, Wrong and Heaven ;\n14 live / video collections (VHS/DVD/Blu-ray): The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg (1985), Some Great Videos (1985), Strange (1988), 101 (1989), Strange Too (1990), Devotional (1993), The Videos 86>98 (1998), One Night in Paris (2002), The Videos 86>98 (2002), Touring the Angel: Live in Milan (2006), The Best of - Volume 1 (2006), Tour of the Universe : Barcelona 20/21.11.09 (2009), Live in Berlin (2014) and Video Singles Collection (2016)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Construction Time Again is the third studio album by the British synthpop band Depeche Mode, released in 1983. This was the first Depeche Mode album with Alan Wilder, who composed the songs \"Two Minute Warning\" and \"The Landscape Is Changing\" (as well as the B-side \"Fools\").\n\nThe album was recorded at John Foxx's Garden studios in London, engineered by Gareth Jones (who had also engineered Foxx's seminal electronic album, Metamatic). It was mixed in the famous Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin (where much of David Bowie's trilogy of seminal electronic albums featuring Brian Eno had been produced).\n\nThe album's cover artwork, though studio based, features the Matterhorn mountain.\n\nThe song Everything Counts was covered by Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames on their album Whoracle.\n\n\nRerelease\nIn 2007, Construction Time Again was re-released with a bonus DVD. The first CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes B-sides in addition to the single and B-side for \"Get the Balance Right\", a one-off single recorded prior to the album. The album is released as originally intended and does not include the bonus extended mix of \"Everything Counts\", but does keep the reprise.\n\nThe DVD includes a documentary on the album. The double-documentary discusses both \"Get the Balance Right\" and Construction Time Again, its two singles, the making of the cover, the lyrics, and the sampling technology used during the album's production. It also discusses Alan Wilder and Gareth Jones, a new member and a new engineer (respectively) and their impact on the band's sound. It also includes footage of the Construction Time Again tour from 1983, as well as excerpts from the music video for \"Get the Balance Right\".\n\nThe remastered album was released on \"deluxe\" vinyl in April 2007 in Europe only.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n1983 release\n\nLP: Mute / Stumm 13 \n\"Love, in Itself\"  – 4:29 \n\"More Than A Party\"  – 4:23 \n\"Pipeline\"  – 6:15 \n\"Everything Counts\"  – 4:19 \n\"Two Minute Warning\"  – 4:13 \n\"Shame\"  – 3:50 \n\"The Landscape Is Changing\"  – 4:47 \n\"Told You So\"  – 4:24 \n\"And Then...\"  – 4:34 \n\"Everything Counts (Reprise)\"  – 1:05  \n\n CD: Sire / 9 23900-2 \n\"Love, in Itself\"  – 4:27 \n\"More Than A Party\"  – 4:30 \n\"Pipeline\"  – 6:08 \n\"Everything Counts\"  – 4:24 \n\"Two Minute Warning\"  – 4:10 \n\"Shame\"  – 3:50 \n\"The Landscape Is Changing\"  – 4:46 \n\"Told You So\"  – 4:25 \n\"And Then...\"  – 5:40 \n\"Everything Counts (Long Version)\"  – 7:23 \n\"Everything Counts (Reprise)\" appears at the end of \"And Then...\" on this release, instead of appearing as its own track. \n\n 2007 re-release\n\nCD: Mute / DM CD 3 (CD/SACD + DVD)\nDisc 1 is a hybrid SACD/CD with a multi-channel SACD layer.

      "wiki_summary": "Construction Time Again is the third studio album by the British synthpop band Depeche Mode, released in 1983. This was the first Depeche Mode album with Alan Wilder, who composed the songs \"Two Minute Warning\" and \"The Landscape Is Changing\" (as well as the B-side \"Fools\"). The album was recorded at John Foxx's Garden studios in London, engineered by Gareth Jones (who had also engineered Foxx's seminal electronic album, Metamatic). It was mixed in the famous Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin (where much of David Bowie's trilogy of seminal electronic albums featuring Brian Eno had been produced).
