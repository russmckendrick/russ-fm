            "content": "Live at Bush Hall is a concert film by British rock band Black Country, New Road released on 20 February 2023 through YouTube. It is the first full-length release since Ants From Up There and the departure of Isaac Wood, the band's vocalist. It consists of recordings from previously unreleased music performed live at Bush Hall, London, over the period of 15-16 December 2022.\n\nOn 31 January 2022, four days prior to the release of Ants From Up There, Black Country, New Road's vocalist, Isaac Wood announced that he was departing the band for mental health reasons. This resulted in the band canceling their upcoming tour in North America and beginning work on new music they could perform without him. They continued to perform gigs as they felt they had to \"keep momentum,\" or it would have \"felt like  were quitting music\". Over the following months, the band wrote new music with the specific intent to be performed live, as they did not want to create a new full-length album at the time. Lewis Evans, who was acting as the band's saxophonist and as one of the vocalists, said that they wanted to release a live performance to act as a \"little time capsule of these eight months that we’ve had playing these songs on the road\". Luke Mark, the guitarist, wanted to avoid the recording appearing disingenuous by making the cuts between performances prominent, rather than attempting to disguise them.\n\nTo accomplish this, the band constructed a unique theme for each of the three live sessions: \"When The Whistle Thins\", which was farming themed; \"I Ain't Alfredo No Ghosts\", pizza and restaurant themed; and \"The Taming Of The School\", 1980s prom night themed. Combined, this resulted in obvious cuts between songs, showing that they \"didn't want to just do this completely perfect thing\" according to Evans. According to drummer Charlie Wayne, they wanted the \"focal point to be this film. We've put a lot of effort into making it feel like you're watching a live gig. It's not an album in our eyes, it's a live performance.\"\n\nBlack Country, New Road posted a short teaser on their social media for something \"coming soon,\" scheduled for release on 20 February. It was then announced to be a recording of their performances at Bush Hall, London, premiering on YouTube. There was also a special screening on the same night of the release at the Institute of Contemporary Arts.\n\nA CD of the performance is due for release on 24 March 2023 through Ninja Tune. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Black+Country,+New+Road/Live+At+Bush+Hall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
