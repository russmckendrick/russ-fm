  "biography": "There were two bands named The Beat, both active at the same time in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Both bands mutually decided to use different names while operating different parts of the world:\n\n1) The English two-tone ska band The Beat known as The English Beat in North America and The British Beat in Australia.\n\n2) The American power-pop band became known as Paul Collins' Beat in Europe.\n\n1. The Beat are a band founded in Birmingham, England, in 1978. Their music fuses ska, pop, soul, reggae and punk rock.\nThe Beat, consisting of Dave Wakeling (vocals, guitar), Ranking Roger (vocals), Andy Cox (guitar), David Steele (bass), Everett Morton (drums), and Saxa a.k.a. Lionel Augustus Martin (1930 – 2017) (saxophone), released three studio albums in the early 1980s: I Just Can't Stop It (1980), Wha'ppen? (1981) and Special Beat Service (1982), and a string of singles, including \"Mirror in the Bathroom\", \"Too Nice to Talk To\", \"Can't Get Used to Losing You\", \"Hands Off, She's Mine\" and \"All Out to Get You\".[3]\nAlthough the group’s main fan-base was in the UK, they were also popular in Australia thanks to regular exposure on the government-owned rock radio station Triple J and the nationally-broadcast TV pop show Countdown. They had a sizeable following in the U.S., and a strong presence on that country’s college radio.\n\nAfter the break-up of The Beat, Dave Wakeling (guitar, lead vocals) and Ranking Roger (vocals) went on to form General Public, while Andy Cox (guitar) and David Steele (bass guitar) formed Fine Young Cannibals with vocalist Roland Gift.\n\nMembers of the band often collaborated on stage with The Specials and performed together on tracks such as “Free Nelson Mandela”. In the early 1990s, Roger joined members of The Specials to form the new band The Special Beat, which released two live albums.\n\nRanking Roger’s son, Ranking Junior, has followed in his father’s footsteps. In 2005, he appeared on The Ordinary Boys’ single “Boys Will Be Boys”. In 2003, The Beat’s original line-up, minus Cox and Steele but with the addition of Junior, played a sold-out one-off gig at the Royal Festival Hall. As of 2005, The Beat has reformed, counting Roger, Blockhead and Morton of the original line-up, with Ranking Junior also on vocals. The band is said to have the blessing of Cox, Steele and Saxa (of Desmond Dekker fame).\n\nThe Beat’s lead singer Dave Wakeling also continues to tour as The English Beat, as he has done for the last three decades, with an amazing all-star ska backing band playing the hits of The English Beat, General Public, and his new songs.\nSaxa died on 3 May 2017, Ranking Roger died on 26 March 2019.\n\n2.  The Beat (known in Europe as The Paul Collins Beat or Paul Collins' Beat), were an American rock and power pop group from Los Angeles, California that formed in the late 1970s. The Beat resurfaced in the 1990s and continues to tour and record new material as Paul Collins' Beat. Frontman Paul Collins has released several projects with his alternative country group The Paul Collins Band, who play Americana music inspired by country rock and folk rock. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[b]As there was an eponymous power pop US group (later known as [a325920]) emerging at the time they were forced to use the names The English Beat on their North American releases and The British Beat briefly in Australia.[/b] \r\n\r\nThe band enjoyed immediate chart success and established their own record label [l27705]. After the split in 1983, Steele and Cox went on to form [a=Fine Young Cannibals] and later [a=2 Men A Drum Machine And A Trumpet] while Wakeling, Ranking Roger and Saxa formed [a=General Public]. Saxa and Everett Morton also formed [a=International Beat], with some guest appearances by Ranking Roger who also joined members of [a=The Specials] in [a=Special Beat].\r\n\r\nUntil recently, two different versions of the band toured fairly frequently: \"The English Beat starring Dave Wakeling\" (a.k.a. [a=The Beat (8)], based in California, U.S.A.) and \"The Beat with Ranking Roger\" (a.k.a. [a=The Beat (6)], which also featured Ranking Roger's son [a750519], and was based in the UK.) The latter group ended with the death of Ranking Roger at 26th March 2019 at the age of 56.",

[b]As there was an eponymous power pop US group (later known as [a325920]) emerging at the time they were forced to use the names The English Beat on their North American releases and The British Beat briefly in Australia.[/b] \r\n\r\nThe band enjoyed immediate chart success and established their own record label [l27705]. After the split in 1983, Steele and Cox went on to form [a=Fine Young Cannibals] and later [a=2 Men A Drum Machine And A Trumpet] while Wakeling, Ranking Roger and Saxa formed [a=General Public]. Saxa and Everett Morton also formed [a=International Beat], with some guest appearances by Ranking Roger who also joined members of [a=The Specials] in [a=Special Beat].\r\n\r\nUntil recently, two different versions of the band toured fairly frequently: \"The English Beat starring Dave Wakeling\" (a.k.a. [a=The Beat (8)], based in California, U.S.A.) and \"The Beat with Ranking Roger\" (a.k.a. [a=The Beat (6)], which also featured Ranking Roger's son [a750519], and was based in the UK.) The latter group ended with the death of Ranking Roger at 26th March 2019 at the age of 56.",

      "bio_content": "There were two bands named The Beat, both active at the same time in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Both bands mutually decided to use different names while operating different parts of the world:\n\n1) The English two-tone ska band The Beat known as The English Beat in North America and The British Beat in Australia.\n\n2) The American power-pop band became known as Paul Collins' Beat in Europe.\n\n1. The Beat are a band founded in Birmingham, England, in 1978. Their music fuses ska, pop, soul, reggae and punk rock.\nThe Beat, consisting of Dave Wakeling (vocals, guitar), Ranking Roger (vocals), Andy Cox (guitar), David Steele (bass), Everett Morton (drums), and Saxa a.k.a. Lionel Augustus Martin (1930 – 2017) (saxophone), released three studio albums in the early 1980s: I Just Can't Stop It (1980), Wha'ppen? (1981) and Special Beat Service (1982), and a string of singles, including \"Mirror in the Bathroom\", \"Too Nice to Talk To\", \"Can't Get Used to Losing You\", \"Hands Off, She's Mine\" and \"All Out to Get You\".[3]\nAlthough the group’s main fan-base was in the UK, they were also popular in Australia thanks to regular exposure on the government-owned rock radio station Triple J and the nationally-broadcast TV pop show Countdown. They had a sizeable following in the U.S., and a strong presence on that country’s college radio.\n\nAfter the break-up of The Beat, Dave Wakeling (guitar, lead vocals) and Ranking Roger (vocals) went on to form General Public, while Andy Cox (guitar) and David Steele (bass guitar) formed Fine Young Cannibals with vocalist Roland Gift.\n\nMembers of the band often collaborated on stage with The Specials and performed together on tracks such as “Free Nelson Mandela”. In the early 1990s, Roger joined members of The Specials to form the new band The Special Beat, which released two live albums.\n\nRanking Roger’s son, Ranking Junior, has followed in his father’s footsteps. In 2005, he appeared on The Ordinary Boys’ single “Boys Will Be Boys”. In 2003, The Beat’s original line-up, minus Cox and Steele but with the addition of Junior, played a sold-out one-off gig at the Royal Festival Hall. As of 2005, The Beat has reformed, counting Roger, Blockhead and Morton of the original line-up, with Ranking Junior also on vocals. The band is said to have the blessing of Cox, Steele and Saxa (of Desmond Dekker fame).\n\nThe Beat’s lead singer Dave Wakeling also continues to tour as The English Beat, as he has done for the last three decades, with an amazing all-star ska backing band playing the hits of The English Beat, General Public, and his new songs.\nSaxa died on 3 May 2017, Ranking Roger died on 26 March 2019.\n\n2.  The Beat (known in Europe as The Paul Collins Beat or Paul Collins' Beat), were an American rock and power pop group from Los Angeles, California that formed in the late 1970s. The Beat resurfaced in the 1990s and continues to tour and record new material as Paul Collins' Beat. Frontman Paul Collins has released several projects with his alternative country group The Paul Collins Band, who play Americana music inspired by country rock and folk rock. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
