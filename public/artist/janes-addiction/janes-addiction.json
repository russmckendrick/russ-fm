  "biography": "Jane's Addiction are an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1985. The band consists of vocalist Perry Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery.\n\nFounded by Farrell and original bass guitarist Eric Avery, following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band Psi Com, Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. Jane's Addiction's first release was a self-titled live album in 1987 and quickly caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The band's first two studio albums, Nothing's Shocking (1988) and Ritual de lo Habitual (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing cult fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the \"Alternative Nation\". The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival.\n\nThe band briefly reunited in 1997, with Flea, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, replacing Avery on bass guitar. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble—and later Chris Chaney—occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third studio album, Strays, before dissolving again the following year.\n\nIn 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Eric Avery, however, subsequently left the band in early 2010 as the group began working on new material. The band released its fourth studio album The Great Escape Artist in 2011, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour. In 2016, Jane's Addiction were nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n2024: Reunion tour, stage altercation and hiatus\n\nOn May 23, 2024, the classic Jane's Addiction line-up of Farrell, Navarro, Avery and Perkins performed at the 400-capacity Bush Hall in London, marking the first time the four-piece had performed together since 2010. The band debuted new material at the show, their first with Avery in thirty-four years, ahead of a full European tour. Both The Guardian and NME, awarded five-star reviews to the band's performance at London's Roundhouse, with The Guardian writing: \"They’ve not sounded this vivid and alive in decades. It might finally be time to believe in Jane's Addiction again – after all, they clearly do,\" and NME describing them as \"a force to be reckoned with\". Navarro said \"some of those UK club dates are among my favorite Jane’s Addiction shows that I’ve ever played\".\n\nJane's Addiction announced a US tour, with support from Love and Rockets, with whom the band had previously toured in 1987. On July 24, 2024, they released the single \"Imminent Redemption\", the first original song with Avery in 34 years. The band stated: \"It is different this time. To have everyone back together, releasing new music. It's time. Welcome to the next chapter of Jane's Addiction. 'Imminent Redemption' is only the beginning.\"The band confirmed that they had been working on several other new songs, with Avery saying he was \"guardedly optimistic\" that they could complete new music: \"The phrase that Dave and I were talking about the other day is: 'If there is a Jane's Addiction in 2025, then there will be new music for sure.' But you just never know if there's going to be a band at all.\"\n\nThe Guardian reported that there were tensions between band members when they played in New York City in September. On September 13, a concert at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston was cut short after Farrell shoved and punched Navarro and was restrained by the crew members. Farrell's wife, Etty Lau Farrell, said Farrell had been suffering from tinnitus and a sore throat and felt his voice was being drowned out by the band. The following day, Jane's Addiction issued an apology and canceled their scheduled show at Bridgeport, Connecticut. On September 16, they canceled the remainder of the tour and said they would \"take some time away as a group\". Navarro, Avery and Perkins released a joint statement attributing the cancellation to Farrell's behavior and mental health, while Farrell released an apology, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\".\n\nOn September 18, the band released a second new song with the reunited line-up, \"True Love\", which had been scheduled for release prior to the band's hiatus. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jane%27s+Addiction\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
