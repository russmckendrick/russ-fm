  "biography": "Extreme are an American hard rock band consisting of singer/guitar virtuoso Nuno Bettencourt, singer/lyricist Gary Cherone, bassist/singer Pat Badger and drummer Kevin Figueiredo. The band first formed in 1985 in Boston with then drummer Paul Geary (who later got replaced by drummer Mike Mangini) until the band decided to go on an indefinite hiatus that ended up lasting more than 10 years (1996 - 2006). The band's influences range from the progressive hard rock and elaborate multi-vocals parts of Queen, the energy of Aerosmith and Van Halen, as well as Beatlesque pop and a Led Zeppelin organic feeling.\n\nConsequently, Extreme's music is never easy to classify; it's not just heavy metal, hard rock, or pop— their albums cover all of that territory with a sweeping ambition and a social consciousness to match. Although a mostly hard rock band, it was the Everly Brothers-style acoustic ballad, \"More Than Words,\" that crossed them over into the mainstream — it hit number one and the follow-up single, the acoustic-based pop rocker \"Hole Hearted,\" hit number four.\n\nThey released two albums in the hey day of glam metal but received diminished attention from the mainstream following the grunge explosion following the release of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" in 1991. Despite this, they released two more albums before the hiatus. Vocalist Gary Cherone went on to join Van Halen in 1997, replacing Sammy Hagar, and the group released \"Van Halen III.\" He left Van Halen soon after, in 1999 and formed Tribe of Judah, with fellow Extreme members Pat Badger and Mike Mangini.\n\nThe group reformed in 2004 for a short tour of Boston and Japan as well as reforming in 2006 for a small U.S. tour. On November 26th 2007, it was announced that Extreme would come back in 2008 with a new album & tour.\n\nIn July 2007 Bettencourt quit Satellite Party for the Extreme reunion with Cherone and Pat Badger. On November 26, 2007, the band announced plans for a world tour in the summer of 2008 with King's X as well as a release date for their new album, Saudades de Rock, produced by Bettencourt. Kevin Figueiredo, who played with Bettencourt in DramaGods and Satellite Party, took over drum duties for the band. Original drummer Paul Geary would still remain involved with the band, albeit in a management position. \n\n2015–present: Six\nIn a May 2015 interview with Eddie Trunk, vocalist Gary Cherone said that Extreme had been writing and demoing new material for their follow-up to Saudades de Rock, and would enter the studio in the fall to begin recording.\n\nIn a September 2016 interview, guitarist Nuno Bettencourt revealed that Extreme had been working on approximately 17 songs for their new album, and added, \"We're about 17 songs into it. We're just wrapping them up. We've got to do vocals, some guitar. Slowly but surely.\"\n\nIn 2016, the band released Pornograffitti Live 25: Metal Meltdown, an audio/video presentation of its 2015 concert at Las Vegas' Hard Rock Casino.\n\nDuring the 2017 KISS Kruise, the band invited original drummer Paul Geary to join them on stage to play \"Hole Hearted\". In June 2018, Extreme toured Australia with Mr. Big, which marked the latter's first tour of Australia and Extreme's first tour of the continent since 1993. After their Australian tour, they went on to tour Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok and Taipei. Extreme headlined Shirock 2019 alongside Scottish hard rock band Nazareth. On October 19, 2019, the band performed in India in front of over 30,000 fans in Ukhrul.\n\nOn February 17, 2023, the band began to release a different teaser each day, to end on February 28. On March 1, 2023, Extreme released the single \"Rise\" and announced that 'Six\" would be released on June 9. On April 19, 2023, Extreme released the official videos for \"Banshee\" and \"#Rebel\" on their YouTube channel.\n\nCurrent members\nGary Cherone – lead vocals (1985–96, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007–present)\nNuno Bettencourt – guitars, brass/orchestration arrangements, keyboards, piano, backing and lead vocals (1985–96, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007–present)\nPat Badger – bass, backing vocals (1986–96, 2006, 2007–present)\nKevin Figueiredo – drums, percussion, occasional backing vocals (2007–present)\n\nDiskogs\nExtreme (1989)\nExtreme II: Pornograffitti (1990)\nIII Sides to Every Story (1992)\nWaiting for the Punchline (1995)\nSaudades de Rock (2008)\nSix (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Extreme\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "bio_content": "Extreme are an American hard rock band consisting of singer/guitar virtuoso Nuno Bettencourt, singer/lyricist Gary Cherone, bassist/singer Pat Badger and drummer Kevin Figueiredo. The band first formed in 1985 in Boston with then drummer Paul Geary (who later got replaced by drummer Mike Mangini) until the band decided to go on an indefinite hiatus that ended up lasting more than 10 years (1996 - 2006). The band's influences range from the progressive hard rock and elaborate multi-vocals parts of Queen, the energy of Aerosmith and Van Halen, as well as Beatlesque pop and a Led Zeppelin organic feeling.\n\nConsequently, Extreme's music is never easy to classify; it's not just heavy metal, hard rock, or pop— their albums cover all of that territory with a sweeping ambition and a social consciousness to match. Although a mostly hard rock band, it was the Everly Brothers-style acoustic ballad, \"More Than Words,\" that crossed them over into the mainstream — it hit number one and the follow-up single, the acoustic-based pop rocker \"Hole Hearted,\" hit number four.\n\nThey released two albums in the hey day of glam metal but received diminished attention from the mainstream following the grunge explosion following the release of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" in 1991. Despite this, they released two more albums before the hiatus. Vocalist Gary Cherone went on to join Van Halen in 1997, replacing Sammy Hagar, and the group released \"Van Halen III.\" He left Van Halen soon after, in 1999 and formed Tribe of Judah, with fellow Extreme members Pat Badger and Mike Mangini.\n\nThe group reformed in 2004 for a short tour of Boston and Japan as well as reforming in 2006 for a small U.S. tour. On November 26th 2007, it was announced that Extreme would come back in 2008 with a new album & tour.\n\nIn July 2007 Bettencourt quit Satellite Party for the Extreme reunion with Cherone and Pat Badger. On November 26, 2007, the band announced plans for a world tour in the summer of 2008 with King's X as well as a release date for their new album, Saudades de Rock, produced by Bettencourt. Kevin Figueiredo, who played with Bettencourt in DramaGods and Satellite Party, took over drum duties for the band. Original drummer Paul Geary would still remain involved with the band, albeit in a management position. \n\n2015–present: Six\nIn a May 2015 interview with Eddie Trunk, vocalist Gary Cherone said that Extreme had been writing and demoing new material for their follow-up to Saudades de Rock, and would enter the studio in the fall to begin recording.\n\nIn a September 2016 interview, guitarist Nuno Bettencourt revealed that Extreme had been working on approximately 17 songs for their new album, and added, \"We're about 17 songs into it. We're just wrapping them up. We've got to do vocals, some guitar. Slowly but surely.\"\n\nIn 2016, the band released Pornograffitti Live 25: Metal Meltdown, an audio/video presentation of its 2015 concert at Las Vegas' Hard Rock Casino.\n\nDuring the 2017 KISS Kruise, the band invited original drummer Paul Geary to join them on stage to play \"Hole Hearted\". In June 2018, Extreme toured Australia with Mr. Big, which marked the latter's first tour of Australia and Extreme's first tour of the continent since 1993. After their Australian tour, they went on to tour Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok and Taipei. Extreme headlined Shirock 2019 alongside Scottish hard rock band Nazareth. On October 19, 2019, the band performed in India in front of over 30,000 fans in Ukhrul.\n\nOn February 17, 2023, the band began to release a different teaser each day, to end on February 28. On March 1, 2023, Extreme released the single \"Rise\" and announced that 'Six\" would be released on June 9. On April 19, 2023, Extreme released the official videos for \"Banshee\" and \"#Rebel\" on their YouTube channel.\n\nCurrent members\nGary Cherone – lead vocals (1985–96, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007–present)\nNuno Bettencourt – guitars, brass/orchestration arrangements, keyboards, piano, backing and lead vocals (1985–96, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007–present)\nPat Badger – bass, backing vocals (1986–96, 2006, 2007–present)\nKevin Figueiredo – drums, percussion, occasional backing vocals (2007–present)\n\nDiskogs\nExtreme (1989)\nExtreme II: Pornograffitti (1990)\nIII Sides to Every Story (1992)\nWaiting for the Punchline (1995)\nSaudades de Rock (2008)\nSix (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Extreme\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
