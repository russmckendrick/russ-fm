      "biography": "Van Halen were an American hard rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. Credited with \"restoring hard rock to the forefront of the music scene\", Van Halen was known for their energetic live shows and for the virtuosity of its lead guitarist, Eddie Van Halen. The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nFrom 1974 until 1985, Van Halen consisted of Eddie Van Halen; Eddie's brother, drummer Alex Van Halen; vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. Upon its release in 1978, the band's self-titled debut album reached No. 19 on the Billboard pop music charts and would sell over 10 million copies in the U.S. By 1982, the band released four more albums (Van Halen II, Women and Children First, Fair Warning, and Diver Down), all of which have since been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was one of the most successful rock acts of the day. The album 1984 was a commercial success with U.S. sales of 10 million copies and four hit singles; its lead single, \"Jump\", was the band's only U.S. number one single.\n\nIn 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four U.S. number-one, multi-platinum albums over the course of 11 years (5150 in 1986, OU812 in 1988, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge in 1991, and Balance in 1995). Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, Best of Volume 1. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album Van Halen III with the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004 and the double-disc greatest hits collection The Best of Both Worlds. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006 Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released their final studio album A Different Kind of Truth, which was commercially and critically successful; it was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang.\n\nAs of March 2019, Van Halen is 20th on the RIAA list of best-selling artists in the United States; the band has sold 56 million albums in the States and more than 80 million worldwide, making them one of the best-selling groups of all time. As of 2007, Van Halen is one of only five rock bands with two studio albums to sell more than 10 million copies in the United States and is tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band. Additionally, Van Halen has charted 13 number-one hits on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. VH1 ranked the band seventh on a list of the top 100 Hard Rock artists of all time.\n\nEddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and died of the disease on October 6, 2020. A month after his father's death, Wolfgang confirmed that Van Halen had disbanded.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen\n\nStudio albums\nVan Halen (1978)\nVan Halen II (1979)\nWomen and Children First (1980)\nFair Warning (1981)\nDiver Down (1982)\n1984 (1984)\n5150 (1986)\nOU812 (1988)\nFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991)\nBalance (1995)\nVan Halen III (1998)\nA Different Kind of Truth (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Van+Halen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "With the sci-fi synth swell of <i>1984</i>’s opening instrumental track, Van Halen fans knew they were in for something different. Released in its namesake year, the band’s final album with singer David Lee Roth—for about three decades, anyway—was launched into the stratosphere by the deliriously catchy single “Jump”. Propelled by massive synths rather than massive guitars, the song was not only a distinct outlier for Van Halen, it was also the group’s first and only No. 1 single. It may have seemed bizarre for a band founded almost entirely on Eddie Van Halen’s next-level guitar wizardry, but the keyboard-boogie of “Jump” indicated where the members of Van Halen were in 1984 (and with <i>1984</i>): on top of the world.\n\nThat means they could do anything they wanted—as evidenced by the band’s second single, “I’ll Wait”, which bumps even more synth. This time it’s darker, with a Survivor “Eye of the Tiger” feel and menacing drum fills, not to mention a vocal melody co-written with the Doobie Brothers’ Michael McDonald (apparently, the lyrics are addressed to a female model wearing men’s underwear in a magazine ad).\n\nOf course, fans worried that Eddie may have abandoned his trademark riffs and licks had nothing to fear. Guitar fireworks are everywhere on <i>1984</i>. The school-daze fantasy “Hot for Teacher” kicks off with Alex Van Halen’s 30-second drum solo before Eddie serves up one of his most dexterous performances. And that’s on top of his dizzying speed-harmonics on “Top Jimmy”, and his insane interplay between rhythm and lead on “House of Pain”.\n\nAfter a journalist accused Roth of writing only about women, partying and fast cars, Roth realised he hadn’t actually written any songs about cars. That led to the birth of “Panama”, an acrobatic ripper inspired by a race car the singer had seen in Vegas. (In keeping with the theme, that’s Eddie’s Lamborghini revving in the background during the bridge.) Then there’s “Drop Dead Legs”, which tattoos a seductive power-groove onto the pumping thighs of strippers everywhere, while Roth rhymes “Betty Boop” with “loop-de-loop”. It might be one of Van Halen’s slowest songs, but it’s also one of their best. Meanwhile, Alex and bassist Michael Anthony lay down a Rush-worthy rhythm workout on “Girl Gone Bad”. Sadly, <i>1984</i> would be Van Halen’s last gasp with Roth, at least until 2012’s <i>A Different Kind of Truth</i>. But what a way to go out.",
