      "biography": "Catherine Bush, professionally known as Kate Bush, is an English singer, songwriter, musician, dancer and record producer. In 1978, aged 19, she topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single \"Wuthering Heights\", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a self-written song. Bush has since released 25 UK Top 40 singles, including the Top 10 hits \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\", \"Babooshka\", \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\", \"Don't Give Up\" (a duet with Peter Gabriel) and \"King of the Mountain\". All 10 of her studio albums reached the UK Top 10, including the UK number one albums Never for Ever (1980), Hounds of Love (1985) and the compilation The Whole Story (1986). She was the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist to enter the album chart at number one.\n\nBush began writing songs at 11. She was signed to EMI Records after Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour helped produce a demo tape. Her debut album, The Kick Inside, was released in 1978. Bush slowly gained artistic independence in album production and has produced all her studio albums since The Dreaming (1982). She took a hiatus between her seventh and eighth albums, The Red Shoes (1993) and Aerial (2005). Bush drew attention again in 2014 with her concert residency Before the Dawn, her first show since 1979's The Tour of Life.\n\nThe TV series \"Stranger Things\" used Bush's \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\" in Season 4.  As a result of the resurgence of interest, in 2022 the song reached #1 on the UK charts, 37 years after its initial release, and generated 100s of millions of streams.\n\nBush's eclectic and experimental musical style, unconventional lyrics, performances, and literary themes have influenced a diverse range of artists. She has been nominated for 13 British Phonographic Industry accolades, winning for Best British Female Artist in 1987, and has been nominated for three Grammy Awards. In 2002, Bush was recognized with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Bush was appointed a CBE in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music. She was nominated three times for induction in the 2018, 2021, and 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "If Kate Bush’s first two albums were steeped in the art-rock of the ’70s (florid piano melodies, thrumming Hammond organs, a <i>Spiders from Mars</i>-grade rhythm section), then 1985’s <i>Hounds of Love</i>, the British singer-songwriter’s fifth LP, didn’t just reflect its era—it helped define it. Few songs are more evocative of the sound of mid-’80s pop than “Running Up That Hill”, with its gated drums, quasi-dance beat, eerie vocal effects and instantly recognisable synthesiser melody. Likewise, few albums did more to take the ambition of progressive rock and port it into the digital era.<br />\nSplit across two side-length suites—the five-song <i>Hounds of Love</i> and the seven-song <i>The Ninth Wave</i>—the album grapples with big themes: the gulf between men and women, the fierceness of a mother’s love, the nature of dreams. Bush’s voice is an instrument of breathtaking power, capable of both tenderness and force, yet Bush herself is everywhere and nowhere: Particularly in the second suite, her songwriting gives shape to a kind of fragmented consciousness, a shifting array of thoughts, voices and perspectives. Cryptic metaphors and allusions give the songs an unmistakably metaphysical aura, and the production follows suit. Bush recorded the album at home, in the 48-track studio she installed in a barn behind her house just outside of London, in a lengthy process of demoing, overdubbing and layering. Availing herself of a state-of-the-art Fairlight CMI sampling synthesiser, one of the first of its kind, she peppered the album with sound effects: church bells, breaking glass, bits of film dialogue and the snippets of Georgian folk music that give “Hello Earth” its otherworldly power.<br />\nYet the LP never feels overstuffed. There’s an abiding elegance to sounds like the fretless bass of “Mother Stands for Comfort”, and whenever the album reaches a peak of intensity, she instinctively knows to pull back. “Waking the Witch” builds from a dreamlike reverie to an almost overwhelming surfeit of input—industrial-strength drum machine, atonal guitars, death-metal growls—only to give way to “Watching You Without Me”, a shimmering ballad located halfway between Japanese ambient music and The Beatles’ most psychedelic pop. In 1985, there was nothing else like it out there. And in some ways, nothing else has ever come close to its mix of pop hooks and avant-garde sound-sculpting. But <i>Hounds of Love</i> also opened an entire world to be explored, with generations of musicians—Björk, Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Joanna Newsom, Julia Holter, to name just a few—following in Bush’s wake.",

            "content": "Hounds of Love is the fifth studio album by English singer Kate Bush, released on September 16, 1985 by EMI Records. It was a commercial success and marked a return to the public eye for Bush after the relatively low sales of her previous album, 1982's The Dreaming. The album's lead single, \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\", became one of Bush's biggest hits. The album's first side produced three further singles, \"Cloudbusting\", \"Hounds of Love\" and \"The Big Sky\". The second side, subtitled The Ninth Wave, forms a conceptual suite about a woman drifting alone in the sea at night.\n\n\"Hounds of Love\" received critical acclaim both on its release and in retrospective reviews. It is considered by many fans and music critics to be Bush's best album, and has been regularly voted one of the greatest albums of all time. It was Bush's second album to top the UK Albums Chart and in the US, it reached the top 20 on the Billboard 200. It is her best-selling studio album, having been certified double platinum for 600,000 sales in the UK, and by 1998 it had sold 1.1 million copies worldwide. The album was nominated at the 1986 Brit Awards for Best British Album, at which Bush was also nominated for Best British Female and Best British Single for \"Running Up That Hill\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/Hounds+of+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was a commercial success and marked a return to the public eye for Bush after the relatively low sales of her previous album, 1982's The Dreaming. The album's lead single, \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\", became one of Bush's biggest hits. The album's first side produced three further singles, \"Cloudbusting\", \"Hounds of Love\" and \"The Big Sky\". The second side, subtitled The Ninth Wave, forms a conceptual suite about a woman drifting alone in the sea at night.\n\n\"Hounds of Love\" received critical acclaim both on its release and in retrospective reviews. It is considered by many fans and music critics to be Bush's best album, and has been regularly voted one of the greatest albums of all time. It was Bush's second album to top the UK Albums Chart and in the US, it reached the top 20 on the Billboard 200. It is her best-selling studio album, having been certified double platinum for 600,000 sales in the UK, and by 1998 it had sold 1.1 million copies worldwide. The album was nominated at the 1986 Brit Awards for Best British Album, at which Bush was also nominated for Best British Female and Best British Single for \"Running Up That Hill\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/Hounds+of+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
