      "biography": "XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.\n\nPartridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and avant-garde. The single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" (1980) and \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982). After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding and guitarist Dave Gregory. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking (1986), Oranges & Lemons (1989) and Nonsuch (1992). In the US, \"Mayor of Simpleton\" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while \"Dear God\" (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.\n\nDue to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of Apple Venus Volume 1 (1999), after which the XTC name briefly served as a banner for what were effectively solo efforts by Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC \"in the past tense\". Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC&I in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active.",

In a 1992 MTV interview with Dave Kendall on 120 Minutes, Andy Partridge said that he had selected the name of the album after encountering a drawing of the castle and, thinking that the archaic word \"Nonsuch\" meant \"does not exist\" rather than, as he later learned, \"unique\". In addition, the album title may have derived from a couplet in the lyrics of the final song of Oranges and Lemons (their previous studio album) \"Chalkhills and Children\":\n\nI'm skating over thin ice\nwhile some nonesuch net holds me aloft\n\nThis lyric shows Partridge misunderstood the proper meaning of the word \"Non(e)such\" prior to the recording of Nonsuch.\n\nThe album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. \"The Disappointed\" was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. The album reached No. 1 on the Rolling Stone College album chart and No. 97 on the Billboard album chart in the U.S.\n\nThe album produced three singles: \"The Disappointed\" (which reached No. 33 on the UK singles chart), \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\" (which reached No. 71 on the UK singles chart) and \"Wrapped In Grey\" (which, when withdrawn by Virgin, prompted the band to go on strike).\n\nTwo promotional videos were made. A UK-only video for \"The Disappointed\" (the band also did a lip-sync performance of this song on Pebble Mill at One) and \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead,\" which received much airplay on MTV that summer.\n\nThe band performed \"Books Are Burning\" live with drummer Dave Mattacks on The Late Show on BBC-TV in April 1992.\n\nThe album cover is a picture of Nonsuch Palace in Surrey, from the book A Short History of Ewell and Nonsuch, by Cloudesley S. Willis. The palace no longer exists, but its former grounds included the present-day Nonsuch Park in Cheam. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/XTC/Nonsuch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
