      "biography": "Genesis are an English rock band that formed in 1967. The band consists of its three longest-tenured members - Tony Banks (keyboards) and Mike Rutherford (bass, guitar), who were founding members; and Phil Collins (vocals, drums), who first joined in 1970. Past members Peter Gabriel (vocals, flute), Steve Hackett (guitar) and Anthony Phillips (guitar) also played major roles in the band in its early years. Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time, with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.\nIn the late 1960s, with the release of their first album, Genesis's music was initially regarded by the band and the fans as a pop experiment, referring to then-popular melodic pop. Then, over the course of a year, (beginning with their second album in mid-1970) they quickly evolved into a progressive rock band with the incorporation of complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation. Their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, extravagant costumes and on-stage stories. This second phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23-minute \"Supper's Ready\" and the 1974 concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. In the late '70s and early '80s the band's musical direction changed once again, becoming more pop oriented and commercially accessible. This resulted in their first top 40 single in the US with \"Follow You Follow Me\", their first number one album in the United Kingdom, Duke, and their only number one single in the United States, \"Invisible Touch\".\nGenesis has undergone several personnel changes throughout its history. Stage fright forced founding member Anthony Phillips to leave the band in 1970. In 1975, Collins, then the band's drummer, replaced Peter Gabriel as lead singer after a lengthy search for a replacement. To facilitate Collins's move to lead vocals during concerts, Bill Bruford and Chester Thompson played drums for the band as they toured, with Collins joining in briefly during lengthy instrumental passages. In 1977, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band. After Phil Collins left the band in 1996, Genesis recruited Ray Wilson (formerly of Stiltskin). Wilson appeared on the 1997 album Calling All Stations, after which the band announced an indefinite hiatus. In 2007, Banks, Collins and Rutherford reunited for a 20-city tour of Europe and North America, which included a free concert at Rome's Circo Massimo in front of 500,000 fans. Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. The future of the band remains uncertain with Collins's retirement from the music business and the other members' solo work.",

            "content": "Selling England by the Pound is the fifth studio album by  Genesis and was recorded and released in 1973. It followed Foxtrot and was the band's commercial peak with Peter Gabriel, hitting #3 in the UK. The album went gold in the US in 1990.\n\nThe album cover is a painting by Betty Swanwick called The Dream. The original painting did not feature a lawn mower; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the song I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe).\n\nTheme\n\nRetaining the pastoral yearning for ancient or medieval England as its primary thematic material, the album focuses on traces of this past in the present. Songs about England's mythological past (Dancing With the Moonlit Knight) co-exist with sketches of contemporary lawnmowers (I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)), and the centrepiece of the second side, the epic The Cinema Show, has two lovers serve as reincarnations of ancient Greek figures in a way which is almost directly out of the \"Fire Sermon\" scene in T. S. Eliot's long poem The Waste Land.\n\nThe musical performances are much more polished and tight than on the preceding LPs. Musical diversions are more often unified into the general song structure. In particular, Steve Hackett's guitar solos in Firth of Fifth show his unique voice on guitar at its best, while the song opens with a highly structured classically inspired piano-instrumental by Tony Banks. As with previous efforts, unusual time signatures and shifts in key and pace continue as key structural devices, and while these formal aspects are no less present on this album, they often serve to support the general melodies of the songs, rather than dominate them. In fact, this album in general shows a focus on melody as the structural unifying force of the songs, as opposed to having the music centre around Gabriel's vocal and lyrical forays.\n\nThe album contains many pieces that would become central to Genesis' live act for years to come, particularly Firth of Fifth  and The Cinema Show, both of which use short lyrical sketches to frame extended instrumental compositions. Along with The Battle of Epping Forest, a song based upon a gangland brawl yet full of references to the squabbles for the English countryside of the far removed past, songs such as Firth of Fifth and The Cinema Show make prominent use of synthesizers, introduced to the band's sound on this album. Firth of Fifth has continued to be included in Genesis live sets, but Tony Banks' piano introduction has not been included in a performance since 1974, in a Drury Lane Theatre concert, when Banks messed up the intro and Phil Collins had to cover for him by simply starting the song from after the intro. Compositionally, The Cinema Show provides the climax for the album's second side, starting off with Mike Rutherford and Banks's trademark intertwining acoustic guitars, providing the backdrop for mythological lyrics, and leading to a long-form synthesizer solo by Banks. This anthemic solo section would later form the melodic centrepiece of the extended instrumentals at the core of the band's 'Cage Medley' (a combination of song excerpts that Genesis would perform live years after it had stopped performing other songs from the '70s), demonstrating Banks' increasing role as one of the band's primary songwriters.\n\nDancing with the Moonlit Knight, The Cinema Show, and The Cinema Show began life as a single lengthy suite in the vein of Supper's Ready, but the band split them up to bookend the album because they felt the suites were too similar and didn't want them compared. As a result, Aisle of Plenty, ending with the reprise of motifs from the start of the album, mournfully brings the album full circle to where it began - nostalgia for old England.\n\nCorrect track list:\n1. Dancing With the Moonlit Knight - 8:04\n2. I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe) - 4:07\n3. Firth of Fifth - 9:36\n4. More Fool Me - 3:10\n5. The Battle of Epping Forest - 11:47\n6.
