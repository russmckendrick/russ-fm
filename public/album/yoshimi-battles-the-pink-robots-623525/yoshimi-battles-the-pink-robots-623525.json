      "biography": "The Flaming Lips are an American rock band, formed in Norman, Oklahoma in 1983.\nInstrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles-such as \"What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical  by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the \"Big Bang\" That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe)\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die.\"\nThe group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with \"She Don't Use Jelly\". Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the \"Best International Act\" category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.",

      "editorial_notes": "There aren’t a lot of distractions in Oklahoma City—which helps explain how the area’s most prominent weirdos, The Flaming Lips, managed to release ten album between 1986’s <i>Hear It Is</i> and 2002’s <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</i>. But that statistic fails to fully measure the band’s proficiency. According to lead singer Wayne Coyne, the group was working on no fewer than three distinct projects while creating <i>Yoshimi</i>, including the country-leaning soundtrack to <i>Okie Noodling</i>—a documentary about men who catch giant catfish with their bare hands—and the synthesiser score to Coyne’s own self-directed full-length homage to 1950s sci-fi B movies, <i>Christmas on Mars</i>.\n\nThose disparate efforts all played a role in the creation of <i>Yoshimi</i>, which Coyne once described as a “candy-coated potato chip” of an album. On <i>Yoshimi</i>, the western twang and martian bleeps meld with the maximalist space-rock the band had perfected on its previous album, <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>. That record secured the group’s place in the pantheon of consequential album artists, freeing the Lips from the one-hit-wonder tag that had clung to the group since 1993’s “She Don’t Use Jelly”.\n\n<i>Yoshimi</i> found Coyne comfortably settling into middle age, complete with grey streaks in his signature long wavy hair. The outsider-artist posture he’d displayed in the 1980s was gone; he was now a seasoned seer, albeit one who still possessed the gift of childlike wonder. How did <i>Yoshimi</i>’s “Do You Realize??”—which reminds listeners that “happiness makes you cry” and “everyone you know someday will die”—end up in three national ad campaigns? Answer: Because while the lyrics are heavy, the brand managers felt safe, knowing Coyne was holding our hand as we embrace the existential crisis. If that’s not enough, the album’s first four songs tell the story of a young Japanese girl, Yoshimi, who’s staring down an army of robots—one of which is having an existential crisis of its own. When the fog of war clears, and <i>Yoshimi</i> comes to an end, the questions linger: Who was right, and who was wrong? Does free will exist? And, to quote Coyne, “Do you realise we're floating in space?”",

It has been certified Gold by the RIAA. Yoshimi was well-received critically and commercially, helping the band break into the mainstream. The album was adapted into a musical in 2012.\n\nIt was announced in March 2007 that the album is to be made into a Broadway musical by The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin and director Des McAnuf.  Frontman Wayne Coyne said of the plot:\n“There's the real world and then there's this fantastical world. This girl, the Yoshimi character, is dying of something. And these two guys are battling to come visit her in the hospital. And as one of the boyfriends envisions trying to save the girl, he enters this other dimension where Yoshimi is this Japanese warrior and the pink robots are an incarnation of her disease. It's almost like the disease has to win in order for her soul to survive.
