      "biography": "The War on Drugs is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed in 2005. The band consists of Adam Granduciel (vocals, guitar), David Hartley (bass), Robbie Bennett (keyboards), Charlie Hall (drums), Jon Natchez (saxophone) and Anthony LaMarca (guitar). \nFounded by close collaborators Granduciel and Kurt Vile, The War on Drugs released their debut studio album, Wagonwheel Blues, in 2008. Vile departed shortly after its release to focus on his solo career. The band's second studio album Slave Ambient was released in 2011 to critical acclaim and extensive touring. \nWritten and recorded following extensive touring and a period of loneliness and depression for primary songwriter Granduciel, the band's third album, Lost in the Dream, was released in 2014 to widespread critical acclaim and increased exposure. Previous collaborator Charlie Hall joined the band as its full-time drummer during the recording process, with saxophonist Jon Natchez and additional guitarist Anthony LaMarca accompanying the band for its world tour. \n\nHistory:\n\nBeginnings and Wagonwheel Blues (2003-2008):\nIn 2003, frontman Adam Granduciel moved from Oakland, California to Philadelphia, where he met Kurt Vile, who had also recently moved back to Philadelphia after living in Boston for two years. The duo subsequently began writing, recording and performing music together. Vile stated, \"Adam was the first dude I met when I moved back to the Philadelphia in 2003. We saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things. I was obsessed with Bob Dylan at the time, and we totally geeked-out on that. We started playing together in the early days and he would be in my band, The Violators. Then, eventually I played in The War On Drugs.\" \nGranduciel and Vile began playing as The War on Drugs in 2005, self-releasing a demo EP. Regarding the band's name, Granduciel noted, \"My friend Julian and I came up with it a few years ago over a couple bottles of red wine and a few typewriters when we were living in Oakland. We were writing a lot back then, working on a dictionary, and it just came out and we were like \"hey, good band name\" so eventually when I moved to Philadelphia and got a band together I used it. It was either that or The Rigatoni Danzas. I think we made the right choice. I always felt though that it was the kind of name I could record all sorts of different music under without any sort of predictability inherent in the name\" \nWhile Vile and Granduciel formed the backbone of the band, they had a number of accompanists early in the group's career, before finally settling on a lineup that added Charlie Hall as drummer/organist, Kyle Lloyd as drummer and Dave Hartley on bass. Granduciel had previously toured and recorded with The Capitol Years, and Vile has several solo albums. The group gave away its Barrel of Batteries EP for free early in 2008. Their debut LP for Secretly Canadian, Wagonwheel Blues, was released in 2008. \nFollowing the album's release, and subsequent European tour, Vile departed from the band to focus on his solo career, stating, \"I only went on the first European tour when their album came out, and then I basically left the band. I knew if I stuck with that, it would be all my time and my goal was to have my own musical career.\" Fellow Kurt Vile & the Violators bandmate Mike Zanghi joined the band at this time, with Vile noting, \"Mike was my drummer first and then when The War On Drugs' first record came out I thought I was lending Mike to Adam for the European tour but then he just played with them all the time so I kind of had to like, while they were touring a lot, figure out my own thing.\" \n\nSlave Ambient (2008-2012):\nThe lineup underwent several changes, and by the end of 2008, Kurt Vile, Charlie Hall, and Kyle Lloyd had all exited the group. At that time Granduciel and Hartley were joined by drummer Mike Zanghi. After Zanghi's exit in 2010, Steven Urgo took over drum duties and Robbie Bennett joined on keys. The band's second studio album, Slave Ambient was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2011. \nIn 2012, Patrick Berkery replaced Urgo as the band's drummer. \n\nLost in the Dream (2013-present):\n\nOn 4 December 2013 the band announced the upcoming release of its third studio album, Lost in the Dream (March 18, 2014). The band streamed the album in its entirety on NPR's First Listen site for a week before its release. \n\nSide projects and collaborations:\n\nKurt Vile & the Violators:\nAdam Granduciel and Mike Zanghi are both former members of founding guitarist Kurt Vile's backing band The Violators, with Granduciel noting, \"There was never, despite what lazy journalists have assumed, any sort of falling out, or resentment\" following Vile's departure from The War on Drugs. In 2011, Vile stated, \"When my record came out, I assumed Adam would want to focus on The War On Drugs but he came with us in The Violators when we toured the States. The Violators became a unit, and although the cast does rotate, we've developed an even tighter unity and sound. Adam is an incredible guitar player these days and there is a certain feeling between us that nobody else can tap into. We don't really have to tell each other what to play, it just happens.\" \n\nSharon Van Etten:\nBoth David Hartley and Adam Granduciel contributed to singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten's fourth studio album, Are We There (2014). Hartley performs bass guitar on the entire album, with Granduciel contributing guitar on two tracks. \n\nSore Eros:\nAdam Granduciel is currently producing the new Sore Eros album. They have been recording it in Philadelphia on and off for the past year and half. \n\nMembers:\n\nCurrent \nAdam Granduciel - vocals, guitars, harmonica, keyboards, samplers (2005-present), \nDavid Hartley - bass guitar, electric guitars (2005-present), \nRobbie Bennett - keyboards, piano, guitars (2010-present), \nCharlie Hall - drums, organ (2013-present, previously an occasional member), \nJon Natchez - saxophone, keyboards (2014 - present), \nAnthony LaMarca - guitar, keyboards (2014-present), \nFormer \nPatrick Berkery - drums, percussion (2012-2013), \nSteven Urgo - drums, percussion, sampler (2010-2012), \nMike Zanghi - drums, percussion, sampler (2008-2010), \nKyle Lloyd - drums, \nKurt Vile - electric guitar (2005-2009)",

      "editorial_notes": "As The War on Drugs have grown in size and stature from bedroom recording project to sprawling, festival-headlining rock outfit, Adam Granduciel’s role has remained constant: It’s his band, his vision. But when the pandemic forced recording sessions for their fifth LP <i>I Don’t Live Here Anymore</i> to go remote in 2020, Granduciel began encouraging his bandmates to take ownership of their roles within each song—to leave their mark. “Once we got into a groove of sending each other sessions, it was this really cool thing where everyone had a way of working on their own time that really helped,” he tells Apple Music. “I think being friends with the guys now and collaborative for so many years, each time we work together, it's like everyone's more confident in their role and I’m more confident in my desire for them to step up and bring something real. I was all about giving up control.”<br />\nThat shift, Granduciel adds, opened up “new sonic territory” that he couldn’t have seen by himself. And the sense of peace and perspective that came with it was mirrored—if not made possible—by changes in his personal life, namely the birth of his first child. A decade ago, Granduciel would have likely obsessed and fretted over every detail, making himself unwell in the process, “but I wasn't really scared to turn in this record,” he says. “I was excited for it to be out in the world, because it's not so much that you don't care about your work, but it’s just not the most important thing all the time. I was happy with whatever I could contribute, as long as I felt that I had given it my all.” Here, Granduciel guides us through the entire record, track by track.<br />\n<b>“Living Proof”</b>\n“It felt like a complete statement, a complete thought. It felt like the solo was kind of composed and was there for a reason, and it all just felt buttoned up perfectly, where it could open a record in kind of a tender way. Just very deliberate and right.”<br />\n<b>“Harmonia’s Dream”</b>\n“It’s mostly inspired by the band Harmonia and this thing that [keyboardist] Robbie [Bennett] had done that was blowing my mind in real time. I started playing those two chords, and in the spur of the moment he wrote that whole synth line. We went on for about nine minutes, and I remember, when we were doing it, I was like, ‘Don't hit a wrong note.’ Because it was so perfect what he was just feeling out in the moment, at 2 am, at some studio in Brooklyn. I was so lucky that I got to witness him doing that.”<br />\n<b>“Change”</b>\n“I had started it at the end of 2017’s <i>Deeper Understanding</i> and it was like this piano ballad in half-time. Years later, we’re in upstate New York, and I'm showing it to [bassist] Dave [Hartley] and [guitarist] Anthony [LaMarca]. I'm on piano and they're on bass and drums and it's not really gelling. At some point Anthony just picks up the drumsticks and he shifts it to the backbeat, this straight-ahead pop-rock four-on-the-floor thing. It immediately had this really cool ‘I'm on Fire’ vibe.’”<br />\n<b>“I Don’t Wanna Wait”</b> \n“[Producer-engineer] Shawn [Everett], for the most part, puts the vocal very front and centre on a lot of songs, very pop-like. I think as you get more confident in your songs it's okay to have the vocals there. But for this one I was thinking about Radiohead, like it would be cool if we just processed the vocals in this really weird way. I wanted to have fun with them, because we’ve already got so many alien sounds happening with those Prophet keyboards and the moodiness of the drum machine. I wanted to give it something that felt like you were sucked into some weird little world.”<br />\n<b>“Victim”</b>\n“Ten years ago if we had had this song, we wouldn't have a chorus on it—it would just be like a verse over and over. Now I feel like we've progressed to where you have this hypnotic thing but it actually goes somewhere. We’d had it done, but the vocals were a little weird. I told Shawn I wasn’t sure about them, because this song had such a vibe. When he asked me to describe it in one word, I was like, ‘back alley’, like steam coming out of a fucking manhole cover or something. And then he puts his headphones on and I see him work in some gear for like 30 minutes—and then he turns the speakers on. I was like, ‘Oh, dude. That's it.’”<br />\n<b>“I Don’t Live Here Anymore”</b>\n“I'll be the first to say it has that '80s thing going, but we kind of pushed it in that way. At one point Shawn and I ran everything on the song—drums, the girls, bass, everything—through a JC-120 Roland amplifier, which is like the sound of the '80s, essentially. I saw it just sitting there at Sound City [Studios in Los Angeles]. We spent like a day doing that, and it just gave it this sound that was a familiar heartbeat or something. It sounds huge but it also felt real—in my mind it was basically just a bedroom recording, because everything was done in my tiny little room, directly into my computer.”<br />\n<b>“Old Skin”</b>\n“I demoed it in one afternoon, in like 30 minutes. Then I showed it to the band, and from the minute we started playing, it was just so fucking boring. But I knew that there was something in the song I really liked, and we kept building it up and building it up, and then one day, I asked Shawn to mute everything except the two things I liked most: the organ and the single note I was playing on the Juno. I brought the drums in at the right moment and it was like, 'Oh, that's the fucking song.’ Lyrically, I felt like it was about the concept of pushing back against everything that tries to hold you down—and having a song about that and then having it be as dynamic as it is, with these drums coming out of nowhere, it just feels like a really special moment. It’s my favourite song on the record, I think.”<br />\n<b>“Wasted”</b>\n“This song was actually a really early one that I kind of abandoned—I sent it to [drummer] Pat [Berkery] because I knew there was a song there but the drums were just very stale. I didn't know any of this, but the day that he was working out of my studio in Philly was the day that his personal life had kind of all come to a head: He was getting divorced from his wife of 15 years. He did the song and he sent it back to me and it was fucking ferocious. It just gave new life to it. Springsteen always talks about Max Weinberg on ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ and how it’s Max's greatest recorded performance. I said the same thing when I heard this: ‘It’s Pat’s greatest recorded performance.’”<br />\n<b>“Rings Around My Father’s Eyes”</b>\n“I'd been strumming those open chords for a couple years—I had the melody and I had that opening line. I wanted to express something, but I wasn't 100% sure how I was going to go about doing it—part of the journey was to not be embarrassed by a line or not think that something is too obvious and too sentimental. As time went on with this record, I became a dad, and I started seeing it from the other side. It’s not so much a reflection on my relationship with my own dad, but starting to think about being a dad, being a protector.”<br />\n<b>“Occasional Rain”</b>\n“As a songwriter I just love it because it's really concise. Lyrically, I was able to wrap up some of the scenes that I wanted to try and talk about, knowing where it was going to go on the record. I just think it's one of those songs that's a perfect closer. It's the last song in our fifth album. It's like, if this was the last album we ever made and that was the last song, I'd be like, ‘That's a good way to go out.’”",
