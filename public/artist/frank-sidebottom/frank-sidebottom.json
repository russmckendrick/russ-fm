  "biography": "Frank Sidebottom was the stage name and persona of the English comedian and musician Chris Sievey (1956–2010).\nThe character was instantly recognisable by his spherical head, styled like an early Max Fleischer cartoon. This was initially made from papier-mâché, but later rebuilt out of fibreglass.\n\nFrank, usually dressed in a 1950s-style sharp suit, was portrayed as an aspiring pop star from the village of Timperley near Altrincham, Greater Manchester. His character was optimistic, enthusiastic, and seemingly unaware of his failings. Although seemingly middle-aged, he still lived at home with his mother, to whom he made frequent references. His mother was apparently unaware of her son's popularity. Frank sometimes had a sidekick in the form of \"Little Frank\", a hand puppet who was otherwise a perfect copy of Frank.\nComedy character Mrs Merton started out as Frank's sidekick on his radio show \"Radio Timperley\", and the similarity of the characters is evident, exuding a sense of great ambition which belies a domestic lifestyle in the north of England. Sidebottom's former \"Oh Blimey Big Band\" members include Mark Radcliffe and Jon Ronson, and his driver was Chris Evans. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sidebottom\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
