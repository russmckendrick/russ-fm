      "biography": "Red Hot Chili Peppers, also sometimes shortened to \"The Chili Peppers\" or abbreviated as \"RHCP\", are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith; and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late-2009, replacing John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards and have become one of the best-selling bands of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nThe band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea. Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's self-titled debut album (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on the second and third albums by the band Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987), but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of his friend's death, Irons chose to depart from the group as drummer. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak, though his tenure was short, which forced Frusciante to replace him in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons. His tenure was also short, so he was replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante, and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother's Milk (1989). In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) under producer Rick Rubin. This album became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour.\nAfter two temporary guitarists, Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction joined for the group's subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number-one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career. Klinghoffer who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, replaced him as lead guitarist. The band's tenth studio album, I'm with You, was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries. The group toured into 2014 and performed with Bruno Mars as a part of the halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVIII. The band is currently recording their eleventh studio album, expected to be released in 2016.",

      "editorial_notes": "In a way, the Red Hot Chili Peppers didn’t truly find their voice until their 17th year as a band. Ever since the band formed in the early 1980s, the members of the Peppers had tempered their unhinged funk-metal madness with breezy, melodic, introspective anthems (many of which would end up as the Peppers’ biggest singles). On the group’s seventh album, 1999’s <i>Californication</i>, those slowed-down numbers became the primary focus. Wayward guitarist John Frusciante had recently rejoined the group after nearly a decade-long absence, and his signature curlicues and lyrical solos immediately rocket <i>Californication</i> to airier, more pastoral regions. And singer Anthony Kiedis leaves the more macho and lascivious elements of his personality behind, fully stepping into his role as the existential poet of Los Angeles: part punk philosopher, part New Age hedonist, part wizened survivor. As a result, <i>Californication</i> became the group’s best-selling album worldwide, while forging a blueprint that would bear fruit for the rest of the Peppers’ storied career. This is the moment—and the album—in which the Red Hot Chili Peppers secured their position as one of the few rock bands that could reliably fill arenas in the 21st century.\n \nThree of the album’s singles—“Scar Tissue”, “Otherside” and “Californication”, all of which topped the American modern rock charts—are indicative of this more mature, contemplative Peppers. “Otherside” is a sparkling, melancholy song that asks “How long will I slide?”, while the upwards-spiralling “Scar Tissue” finds Kiedis confronting the negative impact of sarcasm as a defense mechanism.

          "standard": "In a way, the Red Hot Chili Peppers didn’t truly find their voice until their 17th year as a band. Ever since the band formed in the early 1980s, the members of the Peppers had tempered their unhinged funk-metal madness with breezy, melodic, introspective anthems (many of which would end up as the Peppers’ biggest singles). On the group’s seventh album, 1999’s <i>Californication</i>, those slowed-down numbers became the primary focus. Wayward guitarist John Frusciante had recently rejoined the group after nearly a decade-long absence, and his signature curlicues and lyrical solos immediately rocket <i>Californication</i> to airier, more pastoral regions. And singer Anthony Kiedis leaves the more macho and lascivious elements of his personality behind, fully stepping into his role as the existential poet of Los Angeles: part punk philosopher, part New Age hedonist, part wizened survivor. As a result, <i>Californication</i> became the group’s best-selling album worldwide, while forging a blueprint that would bear fruit for the rest of the Peppers’ storied career. This is the moment—and the album—in which the Red Hot Chili Peppers secured their position as one of the few rock bands that could reliably fill arenas in the 21st century.\n \nThree of the album’s singles—“Scar Tissue”, “Otherside” and “Californication”, all of which topped the American modern rock charts—are indicative of this more mature, contemplative Peppers. “Otherside” is a sparkling, melancholy song that asks “How long will I slide?”, while the upwards-spiralling “Scar Tissue” finds Kiedis confronting the negative impact of sarcasm as a defense mechanism. After years of treating Hollywood like an idyllic incubator for weirdos, the Peppers poignantly explore the town’s darker side on the title track, revealing the dream factory as a place where hopes are dashed, skin is scalpelled and innocence is lost. And tracks like “Porcelain” and acoustic album-closer “Road Trippin’” push the Peppers toward the tender alt-rock ballads of bands like The Smashing Pumpkins. Of course, <i>Californication</i> isn’t <i>all</i> struggle and weariness, as evidenced by vintage Pepper funk-rock ragers like the celebratory opener “Around the World” and the horny “Get on Top” (inspired by Frusciante digging the rhythms of Public Enemy).\n \nBut it’s the more sombre moments on <i>Californication</i> that turned the record into a smash—and led to a pivotal turning point in the Chili Peppers’ career.

            "content": "Californication is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on June 8, 1999 on Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether. The record was a notable shift in style from what was produced with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, and introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.\n\nCalifornication produced several hits for the band, including \"Otherside\", \"Californication\" and the Grammy Award-winning \"Scar Tissue\". Californication peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. It is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful album to date, selling more than fifteen million copies worldwide; a revitalization in comparison to their previous album, One Hot Minute. The record marked a change in style for the band; Rolling Stone's Greg Tate noted that \"while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic.\"\n\nAfter their 1995 release One Hot Minute, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released Californication, which saw them reclaiming their extreme notoriety among the alternative rock fraternity. John Frusciante returned to the band in 1998 after leaving in 1992, replacing Dave Navarro as the guitarist. Navarro, of Jane's Addiction, gave the band a heavy, psychedelic sound; Frusciante brought back with him the melodic 'punk funk' that had helped bring the band to stardom. \n\nCalifornication gained positive critical acceptance in contrast to its less popular predecessor, One Hot Minute, and was a greater success worldwide. Rolling Stone credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: \" vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility.\" Songs such as \"Otherside\" and \"Porcelain\" were called \"Pumpkins-esque\", while the album as a whole was \"epiphanal\" and that the \"RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick.\" Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. Allmusic's Greg Prato said that the \"obvious reason for  rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante\", considering him to be the \"quintessential RHCP guitarist\". The album as a whole was \"a bona fide Chili Peppers classic\". Entertainment Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a \"more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before\". Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that \"'This Velvet Glove' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock,\" Woodlief continued \"the disco intro to 'Parallel Universe' gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante's Hendrix-like excursions at the song's close.\"\n\nWhile many critics found the band's new sound refreshing, NME criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely utilizing their trademark funk sound, asking: \"Can we have our brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle.\" Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be \"the best big-time American rock guitarist going right now.\"\n\nThe album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of The Guardian called \"excessive compression and distortion\" in the process of digital mastering. Stylus Magazine labeled it as one of the victims of the loudness war and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that \"even non-audiophile consumers complained about it\". An unmastered bootleg has been circulated around the internet. Loudness War Waveform of bootlegged \"unmastered\" version (top) versus waveform of original CD release (bottom), scaled to show relative volume levels.\n\nOver the years, Californication has maintained its popularity. \"Scar Tissue\" won a Grammy award for best rock song in 2000. The album was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone Magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for AOL Sessions that included \"Scar Tissue\" and \"Californication\". The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers; five of the sixteen songs on their Greatest Hits album were taken from Californication.\n\nImmediately following the release of Californication, the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock '99, which became infamous for the violence it resulted in. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out of control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song \"Fire\" to finish their set as a favour to Hendrix's sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women who had been crowd surfing and moshing were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that \"It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'.\"\n\nTo kick off the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. Kiedis recalled the situation: \"Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage.\" Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, and then at the Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album \"By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Californication\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
