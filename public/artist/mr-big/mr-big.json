  "biography": "1) Mr. Big were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1988. The original lineup included Eric Martin (lead vocals), Paul Gilbert (guitar), Billy Sheehan (bass), and Pat Torpey (drums). Although primarily a hard rock band, they were also known for their softer ballads. Their music was characterized by strong vocals and rich vocal harmonies. Among their most recognized songs are \"To Be with You,\" which reached number one in 15 countries in 1992, and \"Just Take My Heart.\" The band took its name from the song \"Mr. Big\" by Free, which they covered on the 1993 album \"Bump Ahead.\"\n\nMr. Big released four studio albums during their initial run: \"Mr. Big\" (1989), \"Lean into It\" (1991), \"Bump Ahead\" (1993), and \"Hey Man\" (1996). In 1999, Paul Gilbert left the group and was replaced by Richie Kotzen, who also contributed vocals. With this lineup, the band released two more albums: \"Get Over It\" (1999) and \"Actual Size\" (2001). The group disbanded in 2002.\n\nIn 2009, Mr. Big reunited with its original lineup following fan demand. Their first tour after reuniting took place in Japan. In 2010, they released \"What If...\", their first studio album with the original members in 15 years. During the recording of their 2014 album \"...The Stories We Could Tell,\" drummer Pat Torpey was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and was only able to participate in a limited capacity. The band's next album, \"Defying Gravity\" (2017), was the last to include Torpey, who contributed to select tracks and was credited as a \"drum producer,\" while most of the drumming was performed by Matt Starr.\n\nFollowing Torpey's death in 2018, the band went on hiatus. They later returned for a farewell tour in 2023, with Nick D'Virgilio (formerly of Spock's Beard) joining as drummer and vocalist. D'Virgilio also played on the band's final studio album, \"Ten,\" released in 2024.\n\nMr. Big is often cited as an example of the \"Big in Japan\" phenomenon, where an act enjoys greater popularity in Japan than in other markets. While sometimes labeled a one-hit wonder for \"To Be with You,\" the band maintained a consistent and dedicated following in Japan throughout their career.\n\n2) Mr Big were a British pop rock band active during the 1970s and 1990s. The group was formed by Jeff Pain, who performed under the stage name Dicken. They are best known for their 1977 hit single \"Romeo,\" which reached the Top 5 on the UK charts. The band was initially active from 1972 to 1978, and later reunited for a second period from 1990 to 1998. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Big\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
