      "biography": "Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are an Australian alternative rock band, formed in London, United Kingdom in 1983 by frontman Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and guitarist Blixa Bargeld. The band has included international personnel throughout its career and currently includes Cave, violinist and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey, keyboardist Conway Savage, and percussionists Thomas Wydler (Switzerland) and Jim Sclavunos (United States).\nThe band was founded after the demise of Cave and Harvey's former group, The Birthday Party. Deviating from the noise rock roots of their contemporaries, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have a distinctive take on alternative rock that has been influenced by various genres, including punk rock, gothic rock, no wave and blues. Their early material—From Her to Eternity (1984), The Firstborn Is Dead (1985), Your Funeral... My Trial (1986) and Tender Prey (1988)—had a primarily post-punk sound. As the band progressed, they began to incorporate more refined singer-songwriter elements. Their latest release, Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! (2008), also experimented with garage rock, inspired by their side project Grinderman.\nThey are best known for \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", a collaborative single with Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue from their ninth studio album, Murder Ballads (1996). The song was an international commercial and critical success, giving them exposure in pop charts. The band also has a large cult following, due to their extensive back catalogue of fourteen studio albums and frequent international touring.",

      "editorial_notes": "At least 65 men, women, children and animals are gruesomely laid to rest on Nick Cave’s 1996 LP. Traditional murder ballads—bluesy, romanticised snuff stories, where even the sweetest melody spits out blood and bullets—are so quintessentially, definitively Nick Cave, it’s hard to imagine his persona without them. And while, decades later, an album overflowing with gratuitous assault might generally be considered unacceptable, if anyone possesses the storytelling prowess to get away with it, it’s him. By the mid-’90s, the Australian artist’s identity was already built around lurking in dark, mysterious musical corners and poeticising the macabre, but never so intensely or graphically as here. Following 1994’s masterful <i>Let Love In</i>, here, love was certainly allowed <i>in</i>, but with a morbid, inevitable catch.\n\nOn <i>Murder Ballads</i>, Cave doesn’t just create these exceptionally bloodthirsty killers (or revive those from the traditional songs he reimagines, including “Stagger Lee” and “Henry Lee”)—he wholly embodies them. Hear how he snarls on opener “Song of Joy”, portraying a father whose wife and three children are slaughtered by a serial killer (possibly himself) who paints John Milton quotes on the wall in blood. It’s terrifying, and enthralling.\n\nSome characters are quick to anger, like Stagger Lee, who shoots a bartender in the head four times for mouthing off. Others commit crimes of passion: PJ Harvey portrays a woman who murders Cave’s Henry Lee because he loves another. On the delicate delicate duet “Where the Wild Roses Grow”—his biggest hit to date—he woos Kylie Minogue’s Elisa Day before smashing her head in with a rock: “I kissed her goodbye, said, ‘All beauty must die’/And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth.” The serene gothic scene is a stark contrast to “The Kindness of Strangers”, during which we mourn the sad, lonely death of poor Mary Bellows, found “cuffed to the bed, with a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head”, and the bluesy “Crow Jane”, who avenges her own assault by executing all 20 male attackers.\n\nPerhaps the album’s most disturbing figure is Lottie, the yellow-haired, green-eyed 14-year-old who wreaks havoc in “The Curse of Millhaven”. Her “they all gotta die” mantra is repeated with gleeful calm in between stabbings, beheadings, bashings, arson and drownings. When arrested and asked if she feels remorse, she simply replies, “Why of course, there is so much more I could have done if they’d let me!” It’s a fascinating comparison to the 14-minute centrepiece “O’Malley’s Bar”, in which the murderer, after claiming he lacks free will, begins to feel remorse himself. He too is caught and arrested—the only other character to face consequences.\n\nAside from the philosophical implications that inform much of this album’s mythology, these two songs also best show off Cave’s ongoing musical experiments—and the influence of then-new Bad Seeds member Warren Ellis. The multi-instrumentalist and composer quickly became Cave’s closest collaborator, and his violins and organs here hint at just how crucial he’ll become to Cave’s sound over the years and albums to come.\n\nSo, what’s it all about? Through these broken people, and all their butchery and pain, what, if anything, are we to learn? Is Cave teaching us about the nature of life, death and love, of grief and mourning, of free will and morality? Or is it all just a twisted glorification of Tarantino-level bloodshed? The only song in which nobody dies is the final track, a warm rendition of Bob Dylan’s “Death Is Not the End”. As though in the closing performance of a musical, the album’s cast—Harvey, Minogue, Cave, Shane MacGowan, The Bad Seeds’ Blixa Bargeld and several more—all chip in to assure us that no matter what happens, death is not the end. It’s an oddly sweet conclusion—and one that only leads to more questions.",

Through these broken people, and all their butchery and pain, what, if anything, are we to learn? Is Cave teaching us about the nature of life, death and love, of grief and mourning, of free will and morality? Or is it all just a twisted glorification of Tarantino-level bloodshed? The only song in which nobody dies is the final track, a warm rendition of Bob Dylan’s “Death Is Not the End”. As though in the closing performance of a musical, the album’s cast—Harvey, Minogue, Cave, Shane MacGowan, The Bad Seeds’ Blixa Bargeld and several more—all chip in to assure us that no matter what happens, death is not the end. It’s an oddly sweet conclusion—and one that only leads to more questions."
