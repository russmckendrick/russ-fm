The CD/DVD-Audio set contains a 5.1 surround sound mix of the album.\n\nOldfield has played with the idea of creating a sequel to Ommadawn in the past; \"Amarok was originally going to be Ommadawn II, but it went off a little in its own direction.\" Oldfield's previous sequel albums had all been a part of the Tubular Bells series.\n\nOn 16 October 2015, Oldfield stated on Twitter, \"I am continuing to work on ideas for \"A New Ommadawn\" for the last week or so to see if  the idea actually works.\" On 8 May 2016, Oldfield stated on his Facebook group page that the new Ommadawn project with the tentative title of Return to Ommadawn is finished, and he is awaiting a release date from the record company.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, Oldfield revealed in a Facebook post that the release date was to be 20 January 2017. A 30-second preview was included in this Facebook post, and a 3-minute \"radio exclusive single version\" was played on BBC Radio 2.\n\nReturn to Ommadawn is the first album since Incantations (1978) that follows the format of having one track per side of vinyl simply titled \"Part one\", \"Part two\" etc.\n\nAll instruments played by Mike Oldfield.
