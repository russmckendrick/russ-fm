      "biography": "New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 by Bernard Sumner (vocals, guitars, synthesisers), Peter Hook (bass, synthesisers) and Stephen Morris (drums, electronic drums, synthesisers) - the remaining members of Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis - with the addition of Gillian Gilbert (keyboards, guitars, synthesisers). In 1993 the band broke-up amidst tension between bandmembers, but reformed in 1998. In 2001, Phil Cunningham (guitars, synthesisers) replaced Gilbert, who left the group due to family commitments. In 2007, Peter Hook left the band and the band broke-up again, with Sumner saying in 2009 that he no longer wishes to make music as New Order. The band reunited in 2011 without Hook, with Gilbert returning to the fold and Tom Chapman replacing Hook on bass. During the band's career and inbetween lengthy breaks, bandmembers have immersed themselves on number of solo projects, such as Sumner's Electronic and Bad Lieutenant; Hook's Monaco and Revenge and Gilbert's and Morris' The Other Two.\nBy combining New Wave and electronic music, New Order became one of the most critically acclaimed and highly influential bands of the 1980s. Though the band's early years were shadowed by the legacy and basic sound of Joy Division, their immersion in the early 1980s New York City club scene increased their knowledge of dance music and enabled them to incorporate elements of that style into their work. The band's 1983 hit \"Blue Monday\", the best-selling 12-inch single of all time, is one example of how the band transformed their sound.\nNew Order were the flagship band for Factory Records. Their minimalist album sleeves and \"non-image\" (the band rarely gave interviews and were known for performing short concert sets with no encores) reflected the label's aesthetic of doing whatever the relevant parties wanted to do, including an aversion to including singles as album tracks. The band has often been acclaimed by fans, critics and other musicians as a highly influential force in the alternative rock, dance and rave music scenes.",

      "editorial_notes": "Bass player Peter Hook famously described <i>Republic</i>’s lead single “Regret” as the “last good New Order song”—a harsh criticism, but one his estranged bandmates would tacitly co-sign in the years ahead. As the band’s resident ranconteur, Hook has always been prone to hyperbole. But the charts don’t lie: Upon the release of New Order’s <i>Republic</i> in 1993, “Regret” would become the highest-placing single of the band’s career in both the UK and the US. The song’s success can largely be attributed to its impeccable blend of catchy guitar riffs, melodic bass lines, groovy electronic drums and stirring synth, with a sing-along chorus that ranks as one of the band’s best. But “Regret” also came at a time when the members of New Order were reaping the rewards for a sound and style they’d sown for nearly two decades.\n\nJust as 1989’s <i>Technique</i> revelled in the excitement of late-1980s acid house—a scene that would have been unimaginable without early New Order hits like “Blue Monday”—<i>Republic</i> arrived when Joy Division-inspired alternative music was at its peak. Left-of-center artists like The Smashing Pumpkins and The Breeders were ruling rock, and “Regret” fit in perfectly with the times. But even with a mammoth hit, the band members were miserable. In fact, they hadn’t even wanted to make <i>Republic</i> in the first place, doing so only to support the ailing Factory Records (the label went bankrupt before the album arrived). And while the album was a hit, landing the band some of the biggest live gigs in its history, it would be eight years until the world got new music from New Order—a regrettably long time.",
