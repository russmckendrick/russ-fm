  "biography": "Envy of None is a Canadian-American rock supergroup formed in 2021 by former Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson, along with bassist Andy Curran, vocalist Maiah Wynne, and guitarist and keyboardist Alfio Annibalini[Their self-titled studio album ( 'Envy of None') was released on April 8, 2022. On April 2022, 2023, the group announced the June 9 release of an EP titled 'That Was Then, This Is Now', featuring remixes of two previously released tracks and three new compositions.\n\nEnvy Of None is the new band formed by Alex Lifeson (Rush), Andy Curran (Coney Hatch), Alfio Annabalini, and singer Maiah Wynne. The ambient, cinematic darkness that the collective creates evokes a powerful atmosphere that will excite superfans and new audiences alike. Lifeson and Curran’s longtime friendship was the catalyst for the bands inception - but Envy Of None is not defined by its members resumes - they aren’t Rush or Coney Hatch and far more than the sum of its collective parts. Above the beautiful cacophony of guitars, synths, bass and drums sits the fragile melodies of 24-year old vocalist Maiah Wynne - the newest name in Envy Of None’s impressive personnel. Hearing Mariah’s voice intertwined with the music will bring back memories of when you heard Shirley Manson of Garbage or Amy Lee of Evanescence for the first time. Wynne brings charm and beauty to these recordings in spades - with floating hooks and emotive lyrics transcending the oftentimes textural aesthetic. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Envy+Of+None\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
