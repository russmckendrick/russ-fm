      "biography": "Formed in 1994 in Hellerup, an upper-class suburb of Copenhagen, they had a profound impact on the Danish indie scene, emerging alongside the likes of Carpark North, Swan Lee and Saybia, amongst others, in 2003. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year\".\nTheir first major commercial success came with Frengers, released in 2003, described as \"a work of quiet brilliance, aiming for the epic without straying into the bombastic, offering cerebral arrangements while keeping things accessible.\" The album was well received. After a European tour supporting R.E.M. they began to attract wider attention. Their next album And the Glass Handed Kites was released in Denmark on 19 September 2005, in the United Kingdom and rest of Europe on 26 September, and in the United States on 25 July 2006. The album received critical acclaim, with Mew described as making \"dreamy thunderstorm pop\". They were MTV Asia \"Buzz-Worthy\" as of January, 2006, and at the DMA06 (Danish Music Awards) they took home 4 statuettes.\nOn 11 April 2006, Wohlert left the band to spend more time with his girlfriend, Pernille Rosendahl from the now dissolved band Swan Lee, who was to give birth to their baby boy in May 2006. The two would later go on to form a duo, The Storm.\nThe band tours with Nick Watts (formerly of UK indie band Headswim) as their keyboardist, and Bastian Juel (who used to act as a studio and live bassist for Swan Lee and also played bass on Tina Dico's EP Far) recently joined them as their live bassist. However, he is not an official replacement for Johan and the band has said they will return to the studio with just the three original members.\nThe band finished touring for And the Glass Handed Kites in the summer of 2007. They returned to Brooklyn, New York in May 2008 in order to begin recording their next record, and tapped Rich Costey (who produced their breakthrough album, Frengers) once again as producer.\nThe band's fifth album No More Stories / Are Told Today / I'm Sorry / They Washed Away // No More Stories / The World Is Grey / I'm Tired / Let's Wash Away was released on August 17, 2009 in Scandinavia, August 24 in the UK, and August 25 in the US.\nIn 2009, the band supported Nine Inch Nails for various tour dates across Europe and the United States.\nOn October 25, 2010, Mew released their first compilation album entitled, Eggs Are Funny, which featured 14 songs from previous albums as well as one new song, \"Do You Love It?\". The track list was compiled of what Mew consider to be their \"best work\".\nOn an episode of HBO's Eastbound and Down, airing 10/31/2010, \"Comforting Sounds\" from the album \"Frengers\" played over the end of the show and into the closing credits.\nOn February 9th, Mew hinted that they have begun writing new material in a Twitter post. They confirmed this in another Twitter post on February 29th.",

The album has been called 'one long song', an allusion to the tracks' unnoticed transitions.\n\nThe album has been well received by critics, with Pitchfork calling it \"a terrific accomplishment\". The album has won Mew several prizes in Denmark, including four Danish Music Awards.} It also features at the top of Danish music magazine Gaffa's list of best albums of 2005.\n\nThe working title for the album was \"Saviours of Jazz Ballet\", but even before they thought about calling it \"Circuitry of the Wolf\".\n\nDespite not having been released as a single, the track \"The Zookeeper's Boy\" gained massive popularity with the biggest radio station in Denmark, P3, playing the track intensively. This made it the \"Hit of the Year\" in various polls, and when Gaffa, the biggest Danish music magazine, made a poll, it took first place, with the actual single \"Special\" coming in second. It was later released as a single due to popular demand.\n\nThe album's cover has earned it the dubious honor of being the second album named in Pitchfork Media's \"Your Cover's Blown,\" a column devoted to poor album art. And also in Pitchfork Media's \"Top 25 Worst Album Covers of 2006\".\n\nThis was the last album to feature bassist Johan Wohlert, who left the band the following year to focus on being a father.\n\nPromo versions of And the Glass Handed Kites were selling for around £60 ($120) a piece on eBay months before the official release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mew/And+the+Glass+Handed+Kites\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
