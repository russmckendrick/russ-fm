  "biography": "Mark James Morriss (born October 18, 1971 in England) is the lead singer and songwriter for English band The Bluetones, as well as older brother of bassist Scott Morriss. The Bluetones have released five albums, two 'Best Ofs' and have had a clutch of top 40 singles. They are one of the few bands who can genuinely said to have \"survived Britpop.\"\n\nHe released his debut album, \"Memory Muscle\" in June 2008 to quiet critical acclaim. A gentler, folk-tinged record, it includes four re-recorded tracks which had previously been released under the name \"Fi-Lo Beddow\" as an EP in Feb 2006. The strings on the record were arranged by David Arnold, Grammy award winner and current composer of the James Bond films. Arnold became a fan of The Bluetones whilst scoring 'Independence Day'. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Morriss\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
