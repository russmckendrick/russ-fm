      "biography": "Yolanda Quartey (born 31 July 1983), known professionally as Yola or Yola Carter, is an English musician, singer and songwriter. Yola received four nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards, including the all-genre Best New Artist category.\n\nEarly and personal life\nYola was born in Bristol, England. Her family tried to discourage her from music at a young age, due to their poor background.\n\nCareer\nYola's first gigs were primarily in the jazz and rock music genres. The counterpoints of these genres would go on to formulate her vocal style that is both hard and soft, smooth and raspy. It would prove to be difficult to find where she could fit in with this range of sound in her voice.\n\nYola spent time in her early career as a front woman for hire and feature vocalist, for DJ/producers such as Bugz in the Attic, Duke Dumont, Massive Attack and Sub Focus. Amongst other projects, she also worked at the production company Replay Heaven as a vocalist, writer and arranger in London.\n\nUpon moving back to her home town of Bristol, England, she started spending time making music with some local musicians that formed a band called Phantom Limb. This project ran concurrently with her time in Bugz In The Attic, Massive Attack and numerous other acts. The band disbanded in December 2012, completing two studio albums across 8 years.\n\nFollowing this was a hiatus from performing after her mother died on 30 September 2013. This hiatus gave rise to Yola's solo career, as she emerged playing a guitar, and with songs that spoke to her life and sense of isolation as a black woman in music in the UK. During this hiatus, she also co-wrote a top 10 song with DJ/producer Sub Focus, and delivered the lead vocal on International top 5 hit \"Won't Look Back\".\n\nYola released her first solo EP, Orphan Offering, in 2016. In February 2019, she released her debut album Walk Through Fire on Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound label, to much acclaim. The album title references a fire which damaged Yola's home and she escaped. AllMusic called the album \"an extraordinary record, one designed to be part of a grand musical tradition, and it contains enough emotion and imagination to earn its place within that lineage.\" Brittney McKenna of NPR Music's First Listen declared, \"It's the work of an artist sure to stun audiences for years to come.\" The Wall Street Journal stated, \"The album is an introduction to a seasoned, major vocalist that stands to be remembered as a breakthrough.\"\n\nWalk Through Fire was written, recorded and produced at Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye Studio in Nashville. Auerbach produced the record and assembled an all-star cast for its creation. Most of the songwriting was a collaboration of Yola and Auerbach with contributions from Bobby Wood, Pat McLaughlin and Dan Penn. The team of studio musicians included bassist Dave Roe, harmonica player Charlie McCoy along with former members of the Memphis Boys drummer Gene Crisman and Wood on piano. Additional vocals were contributed by Vince Gill, Molly Tuttle, Ronnie McCoury and Stuart Duncan. The album was recorded and engineered by M. Allen Parker. Auerbach and Parker also mixed the project. In March 2019, Yola made her American television debut on CBS This Morning's Saturday Sessions segment, where she played selections from Walk Through Fire. She, alongside Sheryl Crow, contributed to two tracks on the debut album by The Highwomen.\n\nYola made a splash at the Newport Folk Festival 2019 with Rolling Stone proclaiming, \"Yola became the single most sought-after voice at this year's festival. She played a triumphant side-stage show, served as an unofficial member of The Highwomen, and added her own vocals to performances by everyone from Dolly Parton to Dawes, who let the fast-rising singer take over for the entirety of their 2009 song “When You Call My Name.” According to Glide Magazine, \"People came from far and wide to hear Yola sing, either because they were enchanted by her excellent release from earlier this year Walk Through Fire, or because word of mouth had reached them that this was not to be missed.\"\n\nWalk Through Fire generated three Grammy Award nominations. The album was nominated for Best Americana Album and the track \"Faraway Look\" was nominated for Best American Roots Song and Best American Roots Performance. Additionally, Yola was nominated for Best New Artist.\n\nOn 21 February 2020, Variety announced that she has been cast to play the role of singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe — dubbed the Godmother of rock and roll — in Australian director Baz Luhrmann’s still untitled drama on the life of Elvis Presley.\n\nIn December 2020, she was featured in Ringo Starr's single and video \"Here's To The Nights\", from his 2021 Zoom In EP.",

      "editorial_notes": "After Yola signed with Dan Auerbach’s Easy Eye recordings and released <i>Walk Through Fire</i>, her genre-melding full-length debut that earned her four Grammy nominations (including a 2020 nod for Best New Artist), she found herself facing a stubborn foe: writer’s block. Her increasingly demanding career yielded accolades and an ever-growing fanbase that included artists like The Highwomen and director Baz Luhrmann, but she found herself struggling to write at the height of it. “I had ideas right the way through, from 2013, when I was learning to play guitar, through to when I first started doing shows in late 2015,” she tells Apple Music. “But I hadn't had a single idea from 2019 into the pandemic—just nothing. That level of being busy just completely poached my ability to write. I started deconstructing my process of how my brain likes to function when I'm creating.”<br />\nIf she started humming a tune while straightening up the house, she wouldn't immediately try to interrogate it. She sought out stillness and space, a contrast to what she calls the “excessively conscious” state she often found herself in. “When that part of my brain was off, ideas would appear almost instantly,” she says. “I clearly had inspiration, but there were situations that stopped the ideas coming to the fore, stopped me being able to access them.” Eventually, Yola wrote her way out of writer’s block and into <i>Stand for Myself</i>, an album that meets the high standard she set with <i>Walk Through Fire</i> while drawing in new sounds (namely disco, which drives the groove of “Dancing Away in Tears”) and doubling down on vintage vibes (notably the ’70s soul of “Starlight”) and declarations of self-empowerment. New collaborators came along for the soulful journey, too: Joy Oladokun, Ruby Amanfu and Natalie Hemby co-wrote songs for the album (as did Auerbach, who produced the album, along with <i>Walk Through Fire</i>), and Brandi Carlile lends her voice to “Be My Friend”, an all-too-timely celebration of allyship. Below, Yola talks through a few of the songs on the album and how they helped get her back on track.<br />\n<b>“Barely Alive”</b>\n“The first song on the record, ‘Barely Alive’, is co-written by Joy Oladokun. We were talking about what it's like to be Africans and isolated, and playing guitar, and singing songs, and being into a very broad spectrum of music—and growing up having to explain our existence, and ourselves. You are so often called on to minimise yourself. It can be that your life experience is uncomfortable to somebody and it's triggering their white fragility, so they're encouraging you to speak less on it, or better still, not at all, and to suffer in silence. If you can't speak on your life, then you can't address what's right and wrong with it. That's where the album jumps off from: It's a very concise narrative on my journey, from that place of being a doormat to having some agency over my own life.”<br />\n<b>“Break the Bough”</b>\n“‘Break the Bough’ dates back to 2013, and was started on the evening of my mother's funeral. It doesn't sound like a song that was written on the horns of a funeral; it's a real party song. In that moment I realised that none of us are getting out of this thing called life alive, and so whatever we think we're doing with our lives, we better do a better job of it—just manifest the things that you want to manifest, and be the you that you most want to be. I'd been in a writing block up until that point, and that sparked me to decide to learn to play guitar and inexorably start writing songs again—and that led me here.”<br />\n<b>“Be My Friend”</b>\n“‘Be My Friend’ was one of the songs to arrive in my mind almost complete. That was a real moment, when I was able to come up with something that felt really real, really true, really about the time I was in, but also about my journey. It was as much about allyship [as] it was the idea of what I needed to get to this point in the first place. I thought it was important to call Brandi to sing with me: She'd had the same conversation with me pertaining to queerness, and the pursuit of not being a token, and to manifest your most true self in your art so you don't feel like you're apologising for yourself or hiding yourself in your art.”<br />\n<b>“Stand for Myself”</b>\n“The song ‘Stand for Myself’ is the ultimate conclusion of a concept. It starts with referencing the 'Barely Alive' version of myself: 'I understand why you're essentially burying your head in the sand: You want to feel nothing.' But also, it can speak on people that are experiencing white fragility. It's like, I get it, it makes you feel uncomfortable. You don't want to have to feel empathy for people that aren't like you, because it feels like work. But then it's saying, 'I was like that, I was an absolute parrot, and I didn't have any sets of perspective of what I might stand to gain from not being such an anxious twonk.' That's really where we get to: But I did do it, because I was left without choice. Now I feel like I'm actually alive, and it's really great. You can have this, too, if you're actually willing to do the work—go and take the implicit test, find out what your biases are, work on them, feel things for other people that aren't clones of you—and that's really everything. When someone goes, 'Hey, this album should be called <i>Don't Mess With Yola!</i>,' I'm like, you've missed the point of this record. It's not a <i>don't mess with</i>. It's not <i>I'm a strong Black woman</i>. It's the deserving of softness and a measure of kindness and of support and friendship and love. And that's really all encapsulated in 'Stand for Myself'.”",
