      "biography": "Atoms For Peace is an experimental rock & electronic supergroup formed in late 2009 in Los Angeles, California. The group consists of Radiohead lead singer Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar and piano), Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea (bass), longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich (guitar, keyboards, synths), Joey Waronker of Beck & R.E.M. (drums) and instrumentalist Mauro Refosco (percussion). Their debut album, Amok, will be released on February 25 2013. The line-up had their first live performance at the Echoplex in Los Angeles on 2 October 2009, where they played the entirety of Thom Yorke's solo debut album, The Eraser, as well as some new songs and Radiohead b-side \"Paperbag Writer\". This was followed by two shows at Orpheum Theatre on 4 and 5 October.\nThe band went on a two-week, eight-date tour of some major cities in the United States with opening act Flying Lotus during April 2010 before their performance at the 2010 Coachella Festival, known only as '??????'.\nAtoms for Peace performed a song which Thom Yorke noted as being \"the band's first official collaborative song\" at Roseland Ballroom on April 5, 2010. That song, titled \"Judge, Jury, and Executioner\" was debuted October 2, 2009 when the band played their first shows in Los Angeles. That song's title is partially shared with the Radiohead song \"Myxomatosis. (Judge, Jury, and Executioner.)\".\nFollowing the Coachella festival, Atoms for Peace performed at Fuji Rock 2010, the band's only performance to date outside the United States.\nIn an interview on 21 September 2011, Thom revealed that he and Flea were finishing off an album together. Flea has additionally mentioned this album in interview, and Nigel Godrich has been confirmed as producer. On September 6, 2012, Atoms for Peace released the single \"Default\" on iTunes, as well as presenting a new official website. The album will be titled Amok and is due February 25, 2013 through XL Recordings.",
