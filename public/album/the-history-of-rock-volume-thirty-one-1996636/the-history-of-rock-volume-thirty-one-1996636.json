      "biography": "The Stranglers is a rock music group, formed on September 11, 1974 in Guildford, Surrey, England, United Kingdom. They were originally called The Guildford Stranglers and operated from an off-licence in the town. They also based themselves in the nearby village of Chiddingfold for a while. \n\nOriginal personnel were singer/guitarist Hugh Cornwell (from Kentish Town, London), keyboardist/guitarist Hans Wärmling (from Sweden, replaced within two years by Brighton-born keyboardist Dave Greenfield), London-born bass guitarist Jean-Jacques Burnel and drummer Jet Black (real name Brian Duffy), a native of Ilford, Essex.\n\nThey began as a sinister sounding, hard-edged pub rock group, but eventually branched out to explore other styles of music. The Stranglers were, beginning in 1976, tangentially associated with punk rock, due in part to their opening for The Ramones' first British tour. The Stranglers were also associated with new wave music as well as gothic rock, but their idiosyncratic approach never fit completely within a musical genre.\n\nIn August 1990, founding member Cornwell left the band to pursue a solo career. In his autobiography, Cornwell states that he felt the band was a spent force creatively, and cited various examples of his increasingly acrimonious relationship with his fellow band-members, particularly Burnel. The remaining members recruited two replacements, including John Ellis, who had opened for the band in the 1970s as a member of The Vibrators, and singer Paul Roberts.\n\nInterest in The Stranglers resurfaced when, in 2001, singer Tori Amos covered their song \"Strange Little Girl\" and titled the album it was featured on Strange Little Girls. \"Golden Brown\" was also used in the hit film Snatch by film director Guy Ritchie and extensively in the Australian film He Died With A Felafel In His Hand. Their hit \"No More Heroes\" was covered by Violent Femmes and used for the film Mystery Men. \"Peaches\", finally, also appears prominently in another British movie, Sexy Beast by director Jonathan Glazer.\n\nThe Stranglers had a critical and popular renaissance in 2004 (together with their first top 40 hit for 14 years - \"Big Thing Coming\") with the acclaimed Norfolk Coast album and a subsequent sell-out tour. The follow-up album, Suite XVI, was released in September 2006 (the title is a pun on \"Sweet 16\" and also a reference to the fact that it is the band's 16th studio album).\n\nDuring the recording of Suite XVI Paul Roberts left the band to pursue his solocareer. Guitarist Baz Warne, who replaced John Ellis in 2000, became the main vocalist.\n\nA quite rare Hugh Cornwell audio interview may be listened to on http://www.jasonwrightonline.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stranglers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography": "Squeeze are a British band that came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the New Wave period of the late 1970s and continued recording successfully in the 1980s and 1990s. They are known in the UK for their hit songs \"Cool for Cats\", \"Up the Junction\", \"Tempted\", \"Labelled With Love\", \"Black Coffee In Bed\", \"Another Nail in My Heart\",\"Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)\" and \"Hourglass\". Though not as commercially successful in the U.S., Squeeze had American chart hits with \"Tempted\", \"Hourglass\" and \"853-5937\", and they have a dedicated following there and continue to attract new fans. All of Squeeze's hits were written by band members Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, with the former penning the lyrics and the latter handling the composition. The duo were hailed as \"the heirs to Lennon and McCartney's throne\" during their peak of popularity in the early 1980s.\nThe group formed in Deptford, London, in 1974, and first broke up in 1982. Squeeze then reformed in 1985, and disbanded again in 1999. The band reunited for tours through the United States and United Kingdom in 2007, and this touring version of Squeeze has continued into the present day.\nDifford and Tilbrook confirmed during interviews at the V Festival in both 2008 and 2011 (and in a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone) that they plan to produce a record of new Squeeze material. In 2010, they issued Spot the Difference, an album of newly recorded versions of older material. Then, during their 2012 tour of the US, Squeeze made available for sale a 4-song CD of new demo recordings; later in 2012, the band's first new official studio recordings in 14 years were issued as the EP Packet Of Four. Currently, this 4-song CD EP is only available as a bonus disc to purchasers of various live concert recordings of Squeeze's 2012 UK tour.",
