      "biography": "Led Zeppelin were a hard rock band formed in London in 1968. The group comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.\n\nOriginally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"Ramble On\" and \"Whole Lotta Love\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which featured \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Ocean\", \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" and \"The Rain Song\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"Trampled Under Foot\" and \"Kashmir\".\n\nPage wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the Seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s.\n\nAlbums\nLed Zeppelin (1969)\nLed Zeppelin II (1969)\nLed Zeppelin III (1970)\nLed Zeppelin IV (1971)\nHouses of the Holy (1973)\nPhysical Graffiti (1975)\nPresence (1976)\nIn Through the Out Door (1979)\nCoda (1982) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Borrowing from the Beatles’ assertion that the album, <i>not</i> the single, was rock’s proper format, the band members resisted releasing the five-and-a-half minute blues-metal maelstrom “Whole Lotta Love” as a single from their second album.\n\nThough Atlantic eventually issued a bowdlerised “Whole Lotta Love” as a 45—with the groupie-themed rave-up “Living Loving Maid (She’s Just a Woman)” as the B-side—the album version immediately ranked as rock’s most unhinged and elaborate deconstruction of American blues. Cribbing a guitar line originated by Chicago blues legend Willie Dixon—whom Led Zeppelin, as usual, didn’t credit—Jimmy Page inflated the elemental riff into a roaring jet engine, letting Robert Plant off his leash to growl like a satyr during the song’s terrifying psychedelic break. At times, “Whole Lotta Love” sounds like the world is collapsing—and, in a way, it was: Along with The Rolling Stones’ disastrous 1969 Altamont concert and Black Sabbath’s eponymous debut album in February 1970, the chart-topping <i>Led Zeppelin II</i> signaled that merciless, debauched hard rock—the kind performed in arenas and huge fields instead of clubs—was ascendant, and that Zeppelin were the dark overlords of the new regime.\n\nWhile <i>Led Zeppelin</i> was largely the execution of Page’s bleak studio vision, <i>Led Zeppelin II</i> was a more democratic effort, solidified by a line-up that had clearly gelled playing nonstop gigs. On the soulful, Plant-penned power-ballad “Thank You”, the singer even revealed himself to be…grateful? To a <i>woman</i>? Were the members of Led Zeppelin evolving in real time? Meanwhile, Plant and Page collaborated on the buoyant “Ramble On”, with Plant’s lyrics merging the British tradition of free-walking through the countryside with JRR Tolkien’s <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, as Page overdubbed acoustic guitars to create a muscular folk-rock.\n\nAll the while, the quiet John Paul Jones was establishing himself as Led Zeppelin’s secret ingredient, and one of the most inventive rock bassists. Jones contributed light colour to “Ramble On” that channelled Paul McCartney at his melodic finest, and took over “The Lemon Song”, with Page stepping aside to allow Jones to more or less provide the core riff. Rock critics and UK audiences alike were still oddly dubious of Led Zeppelin’s sudden and very loud ascendance, but not only were they here to stay, they were getting better and weirder as they went.",

            "content": "Led Zeppelin II is the second studio album by English rock band Led Zeppelin, released 22 October 1969 on Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. Production was entirely credited to lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, while it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer. The album furthered the lyrical themes established on their debut album, Led Zeppelin (1969). This progress helped create a work that became more widely acclaimed and influential than its predecessor. With elements of blues and folk music, it also exhibits the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar and riff-based sound.\nUpon release, Led Zeppelin II earned a considerable amount of sales and was Led Zeppelin's first album to reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States. In 1970, art director David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for Led Zeppelin II. On 15 November 1999, it was certified 12x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of 12 million copies. Following its initial reception, it has been recognized by writers and music critics as one of the greatest and most influential rock albums recorded. Led Zeppelin II has also been cited by critics as a blueprint for heavy metal bands that followed it. In 2003, the album was ranked number 75 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Led+Zeppelin+II\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
