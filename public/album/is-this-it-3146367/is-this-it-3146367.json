      "biography": "The Strokes are an alternative rock band, known for their distinctive sound and cultural impact, particularly in the early 2000s.\n\nMembers\nJulian Casablancas (vocals), Nick Valensi (guitar), Albert Hammond Jr. (guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass), and Fabrizio Moretti (drums)\n\nFormation\nThe founding process of The Strokes was a serendipitous convergence of childhood connections and a shared musical vision. Julian Casablancas, Fabrizio Moretti, and Nick Valensi, childhood friends with varying musical experiences, came together in the late '90s. The trio's dynamic was enriched with the addition of guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. and bassist Nikolai Fraiture. Bonded by a mutual love for garage rock, punk, and new wave, the quintet officially formed The Strokes in 1998, embarking on a journey to synthesize their diverse influences into a sound that would later redefine the alternative rock landscape. The amalgamation of their individual talents and shared passion for music set the stage for The Strokes' rise to prominence in the early 2000s.\n\nIs This It (2001)\n\"Is This It\" The Strokes\" debut album released in 2001 under the reputable record label RCA, is an electrifying sonic manifesto that not only redefined the landscape of indie rock but also garnered widespread critical acclaim. Infused with a raw and unfiltered energy, the album became an instant classic, hailed for its gritty exploration of New York City's underground music scene. Featuring iconic tracks like \"Last Nite\" and \"Someday,\" Julian Casablancas' charismatic vocals, Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr.'s guitar interplay, and the band's overall swagger made \"Is This It\" a timeless masterpiece. Its critical acclaim propelled The Strokes to the forefront of the early 2000s indie rock revival, cementing their status as trailblazers in the genre.\n\nRoom On Fire (2003)\n\"Room On Fire\" the sophomore album by The Strokes released in 2003, seamlessly follows the success of their groundbreaking debut, \"Is This It\" The Strokes\" (2001). While \"Is This It\" The Strokes\" quickly became a cultural touchstone and achieved widespread acclaim, \"Room On Fire\" faced the challenge of living up to its predecessor's legacy.\nFrom the rhythmic urgency of \"12:51\" to the infectious guitar riffs of \"Reptilia,\" each track on \"Room On Fire\" showcases The Strokes' continued commitment to crafting catchy, yet substantive, rock anthems. While not eclipsing the commercial success of their debut, the album solidified The Strokes' standing as stalwarts of the early 2000s rock revival, demonstrating their artistic growth and ability to sustain their unique sound.\n\n Juicebox and First Impressions Of Earth (2005 - 2006)\n\"Juicebox\" by The Strokes, released as a single on November 14, 2005, ahead of their album \"First Impressions of Earth,\" faced an early online leak, adding to the anticipation. Despite this, the track's bold guitar riffs and Julian Casablancas' charismatic vocals contributed to its positive reception, marking a significant moment in The Strokes' musical journey. They also released a catchy B-side \"Hawaii\".\n\n\"First Impressions Of Earth\" The Strokes' third studio album released in January 2006, received a mix of reviews. Critics praised the album's experimental departure from the band's earlier sound, commending Julian Casablancas' introspective lyrics, dynamic guitar work, and rhythmic innovation. Standout tracks like \"Juicebox\" and \"You Only Live Once\" showcased The Strokes' ability to evolve while retaining their signature coolness. Despite differing opinions, the album marked a bold exploration of new musical territories and sparked conversations about the band's artistic evolution within the indie rock landscape.\n\nAngles (2011)\n\"Angles\" released by The Strokes in 2011, is a pivotal album in the band's journey, receiving a mix of reviews. Critics lauded its experimentation and collaborative nature, showcasing a departure from their previous works. Standout tracks like \"Under Cover of Darkness\" and \"Machu Picchu\" received praise for blending The Strokes' signature sound with fresh influences. While some critics found the album's diversity refreshing, others felt it lacked cohesion. Despite mixed reviews, \"Angles\" signaled The Strokes' return with a revitalized energy, sparking conversations about their evolving musical direction.\n\nComedown Machine (2013)\n\"Comedown Machine\" released by The Strokes in 2013, is a unique entry in their discography. The album showcases a departure from their traditional sound, embracing a more synth-driven and experimental approach. Tracks like \"One Way Trigger\" and \"Tap Out\" demonstrate The Strokes' willingness to evolve, dividing critics but still affirming their capacity for sonic exploration. \"Comedown Machine\" adds another layer to The Strokes' musical evolution, inviting listeners into a realm of unexpected sounds and creative divergence. The Strokes adopted a media blackout strategy, refraining from interviews and traditional promotional activities. This intentional approach added an air of mystery to the album's release, sparking curiosity and discussions about the band's creative intentions.\n\nFuture Present Past EP (2016)\n\"Future Present Past\" is a 2016 EP by The Strokes, featuring tracks like \"Drag Queen\", \"OBLIVIOUS\" and \"Threat Of Joy\" offering a glimpse into the band's evolving sound during the period between their albums \"Comedown Machine\" and \"The New Abnormal\".\n\nThe New Abnormal (2020)\nProduced by legendary music producer Rick Rubin, \"The New Abnormal\" is The Strokes' sixth studio album, released in 2020 after a seven-year hiatus. The album represents a return to the spotlight for the band and showcases a blend of their signature rock sound with fresh and contemporary elements. Notable tracks include \"The Adults Are Talking\" and \"Selfless\". \"The New Abnormal\" received critical acclaim for its maturity, experimentation, and the band's ability to evolve while staying true to their distinctive style. The album's release was a highly anticipated moment for fans, marking a successful comeback for The Strokes after their extended hiatus.\n\nAlbert Hammond Jr. confirmed, that The Strokes are working on a new album, a follow-up to the succesful \"The New Abnormal\".\n\nHere are the band members' side projects along with their released albums:\n\nJulian Casablancas: \nJulian Casablancas - Phrazes For The Young (2009).The Voidz - Tyranny (2014), Virtue (2018), Like All Before You (2024).\n\nAlbert Hammond Jr.\nAlbert Hammond Jr. - Yours To Keep (2006), Como Te Llama?

      "editorial_notes": "So much lore attends The Strokes’ 2001 debut album that it’s easy to forget just what a straightforward, no-frills rock record it is. Forged in the furnace of messy Lower East Side nights, <i>Is This It</i> bottles the scruffy uncertainty of twenty-something city life at the dawn of the millennium. That’s right there in the lyrics of the opening title track (“I just lied to get to your apartment”), whose groggy unspooling defies the accelerated pace dominating most of the record. Yet once the band launches into the lockstep stab and churn of “The Modern Age”, it’s not hard to understand the album’s watershed status.\n\nReleased at a time when guitar bands—and especially rock stars—appeared destined for a steep decline, these 11 songs offered a ready mouthpiece in Julian Casablancas, complete with distorted vocals and blearily recounted lyrics. Similarly streetwise and black-leather-jacketed, his bandmates echoed his sense of timeless New York cool, from fashion sense to musical references (The Velvet Underground, Television, Ramones). No wonder the band began to dominate photo spreads in the British press before they had even signed to a label, fuelling old-school hype on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nClocking that outsized buzz with a smirking album title, The Strokes managed to fulfill sky-high expectations with songs that hit like instant classics while wearing their precursors on their well-worn sleeves. “Last Nite” unabashedly swipes the opening guitar salvo from Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers’ “American Girl”, while so many other fleeting touches function like Easter-egg homages to previous decades of rock. But this material is every bit as strong as what it’s referencing: observe the grime-caked jangle and nagging heartache of “Someday”, or how guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr gamely play off each other against the anxious pulse of “Hard to Explain”. Even if they present as dishevelled, the band members are tight and intricate at every turn, especially when Valensi and Hammond link up for spidery dual leads.\n\nFor a band so strongly identified with a particular time and place, The Strokes have enjoyed surprising longevity and universality in the decades since their debut. Though content to just be a great rock band rather than the appointed saviours of the genre, they nonetheless inspired the likes of Arctic Monkeys and The Libertines in the UK, and The Killers and Kings of Leon at home. And it all started here.",
