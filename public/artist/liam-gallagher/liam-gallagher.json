  "biography": "William John Paul Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band  Oasis, which he co-founded in 1991. He later fronted the band Beady Eye from 2010 to 2014 before launching a solo career in 2017. Gallagher is regarded as one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music and is known for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken manner.\n\nGallagher joined a band initially known as the Rain. Following mutual agreement among its members, the band was renamed Oasis. His older brother, Noel Gallagher, was first approached to manage the group but later joined as lead guitarist. Oasis released their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe\", in 1994 to critical and commercial success amid the rise of Britpop. Their second album, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", released in 1995, achieved international chart success, while their third album, \"Be Here Now\" (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Although Britpop declined in popularity towards the end of the 1990s, Oasis continued to release commercially successful albums, all of which topped the UK Albums Chart. The band performed to large audiences worldwide, particularly in Europe and South America. In August 2009, following Noel Gallagher’s departure from Oasis, Liam Gallagher and the remaining members formed Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums before disbanding in 2014.\n\nGallagher began his solo career in 2017 with the release of his debut album \"As You Were\", which was both a critical and commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. The album was later certified platinum in the UK. His second solo album, \"Why Me? Why Not\", released in 2019, also reached number one and became the fastest-selling vinyl record of that year. This marked Gallagher’s tenth number one album, including his work with Oasis. His third solo album, \"C’mon You Know\", released in 2022, also debuted at number one in the UK. In 2024, Gallagher collaborated with former Stone Roses guitarist John Squire on the studio album \"Liam Gallagher & John Squire\", released on 1 March 2024.\n\nGallagher's career with Oasis was marked by public disputes with his brother Noel and frequent media coverage of their personal behaviour. The band’s rivalry with fellow Britpop group Blur also received significant attention during the 1990s. In 2010, Gallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a Q magazine reader poll. In 2019, he was awarded the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Gallagher\n\nStudio albums\nAs You Were (2017)\nWhy Me? Why Not.

      "bio_content": "William John Paul Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band  Oasis, which he co-founded in 1991. He later fronted the band Beady Eye from 2010 to 2014 before launching a solo career in 2017. Gallagher is regarded as one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music and is known for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken manner.\n\nGallagher joined a band initially known as the Rain. Following mutual agreement among its members, the band was renamed Oasis. His older brother, Noel Gallagher, was first approached to manage the group but later joined as lead guitarist. Oasis released their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe\", in 1994 to critical and commercial success amid the rise of Britpop. Their second album, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", released in 1995, achieved international chart success, while their third album, \"Be Here Now\" (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Although Britpop declined in popularity towards the end of the 1990s, Oasis continued to release commercially successful albums, all of which topped the UK Albums Chart. The band performed to large audiences worldwide, particularly in Europe and South America. In August 2009, following Noel Gallagher’s departure from Oasis, Liam Gallagher and the remaining members formed Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums before disbanding in 2014.\n\nGallagher began his solo career in 2017 with the release of his debut album \"As You Were\", which was both a critical and commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. The album was later certified platinum in the UK. His second solo album, \"Why Me? Why Not\", released in 2019, also reached number one and became the fastest-selling vinyl record of that year. This marked Gallagher’s tenth number one album, including his work with Oasis. His third solo album, \"C’mon You Know\", released in 2022, also debuted at number one in the UK. In 2024, Gallagher collaborated with former Stone Roses guitarist John Squire on the studio album \"Liam Gallagher & John Squire\", released on 1 March 2024.\n\nGallagher's career with Oasis was marked by public disputes with his brother Noel and frequent media coverage of their personal behaviour. The band’s rivalry with fellow Britpop group Blur also received significant attention during the 1990s. In 2010, Gallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a Q magazine reader poll. In 2019, he was awarded the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Gallagher\n\nStudio albums\nAs You Were (2017)\nWhy Me? Why Not.
