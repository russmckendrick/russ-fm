      "biography": "LCD Soundsystem was an American-based dance-punk band from New York City. It was fronted by American singer-songwriter and producer James Murphy, co-founder of record label DFA Records. The group released three critically acclaimed albums, LCD Soundsystem, Sound of Silver and This Is Happening, with the last charting in the Billboard Top 10.\nOn February 5, 2011, a statement was posted on the band's website that announced its disbandment following a farewell concert, which took place on April 2, 2011, at Madison Square Garden. The farewell concert is chronicled in the documentary film Shut Up and Play the Hits. Their last televised performance was on February 14, 2011 on The Colbert Report.\nLCD Soundsystem gained attention with its first single, \"Losing My Edge\". Described as \"an eight-minute, laugh-out-loud funny dissection of cool over a dirty electronic beat\"; the single became an underground dance favorite. This was followed by other well received singles \"Give It Up\" and \"Yeah\".\nLCD Soundsystem released a double disc set simply titled LCD Soundsystem in February 2005 to critical acclaim. The first disc contains the album and the second contains re-releases of previous singles. The opening track \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\" quickly gained popularity and entered the UK Top 40 in March 2005 and was later featured on several video game soundtracks like SSX on Tour, Forza Motorsport 2, Burnout Revenge, and FIFA 06. The band toured with M.I.A.\nIn June 2005, the band covered a Siouxsie and the Banshees song, \"Slowdive\" for the B-side of \"Disco Infiltrator\".\nOn December 8, 2005 the group received nominations for two Grammy awards in the Electronica category for their self-titled album and in the Dance category for \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House.\" This album was also chosen as #94 of Amazon.com's \"Top 100 Editor's Picks\" of 2005.",

      "editorial_notes": "Few artists of his generation have a superhero origin story as compelling as James Murphy. A failed musician and touring sound man—one who’d spent his twenties chasing popularity in the notoriously insular 1990s American indie rock scene—Murphy had all but given up on his dream of achieving underground celebrity by the time he met another unsung producer: Tim Goldsworthy, the silent partner in ultra-hip UK imprint Mo’ Wax.\n\nThe latter introduced the former to DJing and ecstasy, and they began to collaborate in the studio as The DFA, introducing a retro disco-meets-post-punk sound to a New York downtown scene whose denizens were craving their own version of the city’s late-1970s and early-1980s creative heyday. The DFA struck gold almost immediately, producing the genre-defining dance-punk classic “House of Jealous Lovers” by The Rapture. That song, in turn, attracted other cool kids, from NYC hipsters Le Tigre to chart-topping hip-hop weirdos N.E.R.D., both of whom approached Murphy and Goldsworthy about remixes (the duo even took a meeting with one of The Neptunes’ clients, pop princess Britney Spears).\n\nAt the same time, Murphy had begun producing his own music as LCD Soundsystem. The first LCD single, 2002’s “Losing My Edge”, became an unexpected anthem, one that captured the concerns of an aging hipster who was literally losing cachet to “the kids coming up from behind”. That song was followed by “Yeah”, which doubled down on the disco beats. Those tracks would wind up on LCD Soundsystem’s 2005 self-titled debut, along with the breakout hit “Daft Punk is Playing at My House”, an indie-sleaze anthem released a year before the French duo’s legendary Coachella performance. “Daft Punk” demonstrated Murphy’s ability to divine musical trends, a skill he’d bring to his DFA label, which released buzzy records like Hot Chip’s 2006 breakthrough record, <i>The Warning</i>. But Murphy would soon seize the mantle of coolest-of-the-cool-kids for himself in 2007, with the release of LCD Soundsystem’s hit-packed <i>Sound of Silver</i>.",
