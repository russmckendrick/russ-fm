      "biography": "The Supremes were an American female singing group and the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s. Originally founded as the Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes' repertoire included doo-wop, pop, soul, Broadway show tunes, psychedelic soul, and disco. They were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success.\nFounding members Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, all from the Brewster-Douglass public housing project in Detroit, formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio.\nDuring the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. Ross left to pursue a solo career in 1970 and was replaced by Jean Terrell, at which point the group's name reverted to the Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s. The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after an 18-year run.",

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> In 1974, Stevie Wonder was the most critically revered pop star in the world; he was also considering leaving the music industry altogether. So when <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i> was released two years later, demand was so high that it became, at the time, the fastest-selling album in history. Wonder positioned himself as the purveyor of a vast self-drawn cosmos, one with a remarkable cache of songs: <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i>, which runs nearly 90 minutes, is effortlessly melodic, broad in scope, deeply personal—and often just plain weird.\n\nStart with the brassy and positively effusive chart-topping singles “Sir Duke” and “I Wish”, both nostalgic and modern-sounding at once. At the other end of the spectrum: the stark reality of “Village Ghetto Land” and “Pastime Paradise”, on which Wonder decries the abandonment of the civil rights dream. Then there’s the joyous “Isn’t She Lovely”, celebrating the arrival of Wonder’s daughter Aisha.\n\nAs <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i> nears its conclusion, Wonder returns to the dance floor for 15 minutes of sumptuous gospel-disco in “As” and “Another Star”, each expressing a deep passion in layers of instrumentation and impressive vocal runs. But Stevie isn’t done; another defining moment on the album is a bonus track, one originally issued as an extra 45 with the album’s vinyl release. It starts in deep space with the Afrofuturist fantasia “Saturn”, and then, as its last synthesiser chords fade out, Wonder zooms light-years to an urban playground where we can hear the sound of children skipping Double Dutch. Sonically, culturally and emotionally, <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i> is much more than a gigantic collection of songs—it forms an entire world view.",

The opening \"Love's in Need of Love Today\" and \"Have a Talk with God\" are curiously subdued, but Stevie soon kicks into gear with \"Village Ghetto Land,\" a fierce exposé of ghetto neglect set to a satirical Baroque synthesizer. Hot on its heels comes the torrid fusion jam \"Contusion,\" a big, brassy hit tribute to the recently departed Duke Ellington in \"Sir Duke,\" and (another hit, this one a Grammy winner as well) the bumping poem to his childhood, \"I Wish.\" Though they didn't necessarily appear in order, Songs in the Key of Life contains nearly a full album on love and relationships, along with another full album on issues social and spiritual. Fans of the love album Talking Book can marvel that he sets the bar even higher here, with brilliant material like the tenderly cathartic and gloriously redemptive \"Joy Inside My Tears,\" the two-part, smooth-and-rough \"Ordinary Pain,\" the bitterly ironic \"All Day Sucker,\" or another classic heartbreaker, \"Summer Soft.\" Those inclined toward Stevie Wonder the social-issues artist had quite a few songs to focus on as well: \"Black Man\" was a Bicentennial school lesson on remembering the vastly different people who helped build America; \"Pastime Paradise\" examined the plight of those who live in the past and have little hope for the future; \"Village Ghetto Land\" brought listeners to a nightmare of urban wasteland; and \"Saturn\" found Stevie questioning his kinship with the rest of humanity and amusingly imagining paradise as a residency on a distant planet. If all this sounds overwhelming, it is; Stevie Wonder had talent to spare during the mid-'70s, and instead of letting the reserve trickle out during the rest of the decade, he let it all go with one massive burst.
