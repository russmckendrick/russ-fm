      "biography": "David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie, was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.\n\nBowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s starting with Let's Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).\n\nDuring his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie\n\nStudio albums\nDavid Bowie (1967)\nDavid Bowie/Space Oddity (1969)\nThe Man Who Sold the World (1970)\nHunky Dory (1971)\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972)\nAladdin Sane (1973)\nPin Ups (1973)\nDiamond Dogs (1974)\nYoung Americans (1975)\nStation to Station (1976)\nLow (1977)\n\"Heroes\" (1977)\nLodger (1979)\nScary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980)\nLet's Dance (1983)\nTonight (1984)\nNever Let Me Down (1987)\nBlack Tie White Noise (1993)\nThe Buddha of Suburbia (1993)\nOutside (1995)\nEarthling (1997)\nHours (1999)\nHeathen (2002)\nReality (2003)\nThe Next Day (2013)\nBlackstar (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Next Day Extra, an additional disc featuring four more tracks, and remixes of songs from the original album, was released eight months later in November.  The Next Day was met with critical acclaim, and earned Bowie his first number-one album in the UK since 1993's Black Tie White Noise.\n\nThe cover art for the album is an adapted version of Bowie's 1977 album, \"Heroes\".  Designed by Jonathan Barnbrook, who also designed packaging for Heathen and Reality, the obscuring of the photograph connotes \"forgetting or obliterating the past\".  Barnbrook explained the cover, saying: \"If you are going to subvert an album by David Bowie there are many to choose from but this is one of his most revered, it had to be an image that would really jar if it were subverted in some way and we thought \"Heroes\" worked best on all counts.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/The+Next+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
