  "biography": "Michael Lee Aday (born Marvin Lee Aday; September 27, 1947 – January 20, 2022), known professionally as Meat Loaf, was an American rock singer and actor with a powerful, wide-ranging voice, famous for his theatrical live shows. He is on the list of best-selling music artists. His Bat Out of Hell trilogy — Bat Out of Hell (1977), Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell (1993), and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006) — has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. The first album stayed on the charts for over nine years, as of 2016 still sold an estimated 200,000 copies annually, and is on the list of best-selling albums.\n\nAfter the commercial success of Bat Out of Hell and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell, and earning a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for the song \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\", Meat Loaf nevertheless experienced some difficulty establishing a steady career within the United States. The key to this success was his popularity in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom and Ireland. He received the 1994 Brit Award in the United Kingdom for best-selling album and single. He appeared in the 1997 film Spice World and he ranked 23rd for the number of weeks spent on the UK charts in 2006. He ranks 96th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\". Meat Loaf appeared in over 50 films and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His film roles include Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and Robert Paulsen in Fight Club (1999). His early stage work included dual roles in the original Broadway cast of The Rocky Horror Show. He also appeared in the musical Hair, both on and Off-Broadway.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Loaf\n\nStudio albums\nBat Out of Hell (1977)\nDead Ringer (1981)\nMidnight at the Lost and Found (1983)\nBad Attitude (1984)\nBlind Before I Stop (1986)\nBat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell (1993)\nWelcome to the Neighbourhood (1995)\nCouldn't Have Said It Better (2003)\nBat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006)\nHang Cool Teddy Bear (2010)\nHell in a Handbasket (2011)\nBraver Than We Are (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Meat+Loaf\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
