  "biography": "Trevor Charles Horn, born July 15, 1949 in Durham, England, is a British pop music producer, songwriter and musician.  He has produced commercially successful songs and albums for numerous British and international artists, as well as having chart success with his own bands the Buggles, Yes and Art of Noise. He also owns a recording company, ZTT Records, a recording studio (Sarm Studio) and a music publishing company, Perfect Songs.\n\nTrevor Horn moved to Leicester after leaving school.  Horn began his professional career as a backing musician in the late 70's for disco star Tina Charles. One of the other members of her backing band was keyboard player Geoff Downes.  Horn and Downes joined with Bruce Woolley to form the Buggles in 1977, in which Horn played bass, guitar and percussion as well as providing vocals. They released \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" in 1979, which went to No 1 in the UK charts.  The song also appeared on the group's first album, The Age of Plastic, which was released in 1980.  Later in the same year Horn and Downes were invited to join the rock group Yes.  Horn became the lead vocalist, replacing Jon Anderson.  He recorded one album with the band, Drama, on which he also plays bass on one track.  However, he left after seven months, at the beginning of 1981, to concentrate on his production work.  He also completed a second Buggles album, Adventures In Modern Recording, mainly alone after a falling out with Geoff Downes. Horn did work with Yes again, not as a band member, but (co-)producing their next two studio albums, including the noted 1983 \"comeback\" album 90125, and also went on to be a founder member of Art of Noise. He is known for performing on albums he produces.\n\nHorn's first production success came with the pop band Dollar in 1981 and 1982.  He then went on to produce The Lexicon of Love (1982) by ABC, which reached no 1 in the UK album charts.\n\nHe achieved his greatest commercial success in 1984, firstly with the Liverpudlian band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and secondly with the charity group Band Aid and their enormous hit \"Do They Know It's Christmas\".  In the UK, Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the best-selling band of 1984; the success of singles such as \"Relax\" and \"Two Tribes\" helped to bankroll ZTT Records, which Horn had co-founded in 1983.  \"Do They Know It's Christmas\" became one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\nOther artists he has produced include Grace Jones, Seal, Propaganda, Tina Turner, Lisa Stansfield, Tom Jones, Paul McCartney, Pet Shop Boys, Mike Oldfield, Marc Almond, Charlotte Church, t.A.T.u, LeAnn Rimes, and Belle & Sebastian.  Horn received a Grammy in 1996 for Seal's second album.\n\nOn November 11, 2004, a Prince's Trust charity concert celebrating Horn's 25 years as a record producer took place at Wembley Arena. Performers at the show included The Buggles, ABC, The Art of Noise, Belle & Sebastian, Lisa Stansfield, Pet Shop Boys, Seal, Simple Minds, Dollar, t.A.T.u., Yes, Grace Jones and Frankie Goes To Hollywood (with Ryan Molloy replacing original vocalist Holly Johnson). A double CD compilation titled Produced By Trevor Horn (Produced by Trevor Horn - L and Produced by Trevor Horn - R) was released in conjunction with the concert. An edited version of the concert has been broadcast on television in several countries under the title 25 Years Of Pop: Produced By Trevor Horn, and a DVD release of the full concert is planned.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trevor+Horn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
