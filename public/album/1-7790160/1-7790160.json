      "biography": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, becoming one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon (rhythm guitar/vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar/vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar/vocals), and Ringo Starr (drums/vocals). Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the group later utilised many genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements, in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\nAs a five-piece line-up of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison on guitar and vocals, with Stuart Sutcliffe (bass), and Pete Best (drums), the band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Sutcliffe left the group in 1961, and Best was replaced by Starr the following year. They were moulded into a professional act by manager Brian Epstein, and their musical potential was enhanced by the creativity of producer George Martin. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first single, \"Love Me Do\", became a modest hit in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. The band toured extensively around the world until August 1966, when they performed their final commercial concert. From 1966 they produced what many critics consider to be some of their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, the ex-Beatles each found success in individual musical careers. Lennon was murdered in 1980, and Harrison died of cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain active.\nThe Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with sales of over one billion units estimated by EMI Records. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 they have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist, and in 2008 they topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.",

            "content": "1 is a compilation album by the English rock band the Beatles, originally released on 13 November 2000. The album features virtually every number-one single the band achieved in the United Kingdom and the United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on only one CD. 1 was a commercial success and topped the charts worldwide. It has sold over 31 million copies.\n\nIn addition, 1 is the fourth best-selling album in the US since Nielsen Sound Scan began tracking US album sales in January 1991 and the best-selling album of the decade (2000 to 2009) in the US, as well as the best-selling album of the decade worldwide. 1 was remastered and reissued in September 2011 and was remixed and reissued again in several different deluxe editions in November 2015, the most comprehensive of which is a three-disc set entitled 1+, which includes video discs of the band's music videos.\n\nAs of June 2015, 1 is the sixth best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK, having sold over 3.1 million copies.\n\nBackground:\nCompiled by producer George Martin and the (then) three surviving members of the band, 1 includes the 27 Beatles songs that went to number one in the United Kingdom on the Record Retailer Top 50 chart or in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It is worth noting, however, that the song \"For You Blue\" was listed on Billboard chart at number 1, along with the A-side \"The Long and Winding Road\", but Capitol Records treated \"For You Blue\" as strictly a B-side and did not promote it as an A-side. Meanwhile, \"Day Tripper\" was included on 1, since it charted at number 1 in the UK as a double A-side with \"We Can Work It Out,\" while in the US, only \"We Can Work It Out\" was number 1. Two notable singles released in both the UK and the US that did not reach number 1 in either country, and were therefore ineligible for inclusion on the album, were \"Please Please Me\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" (both reached number 2 in the UK charts, while in the US the former peaked at number 3, and the latter at number 8). The former was largely known as \"The Beatles' first UK number one single\"; however, it reached the top spot in the musical magazines New Musical Express and Melody Maker but not on the chart published by Record Retailer (now Music Week). On the other hand, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" was part of a double A-side single along with \"Penny Lane.\" This single had peaked at number 2 in the charts, behind Engelbert Humperdinck's single \"Release Me.\"\n\nThis album is essentially a combination of both the US and UK versions of the earlier album 20 Greatest Hits, with the addition of \"Something\" (which was left off 20 Greatest Hits because of time constraints). On 1, \"Hey Jude\" was released in its original full-length version (slightly over seven minutes); on the American version of 20 Greatest Hits it had been released as a shortened version.\n\nRemastering:\nBefore 1, all 27 songs were available mainly in two remastered CD versions. First, on the respective Beatles albums released in 1987 (as well as Past Masters, Volume One and Past Masters, Volume Two, released in 1988). The second remastering was made available on the CD versions for 1962–1966 and 1967–1970 (released in 1993).\n\nThe songs on 1 were remastered specifically for the release in 2000. According to the liner notes of the album, the original analog masters were \"digitally remastered at 24 bits resolution, processed using Sonic Solutions NoNoise technology and mastered to 16 bit using Prism SNS Noise Shaping.\" The remastering was overseen by Peter Mew of Abbey Road Studios and took place there. In 2011, 1 was remastered and reissued on CD. In 2015 it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin when Martin began to assist with fixing up the audio tracks for the 1+ video clips, he realized that his goal of making them “more immersive” should also apply to 1. For the remixing project, the remasters went back to the final mix tapes, remastered them, cleaned them up and then EQ-ed them and released them. About the remastering, Martin commented: \"My approach was to be respectful of everything, I had sessions and sessions where I flipped between previously remastered stereos, the mono remasters, and the remixes we’ve done. I flip between everything and make sure I prefer what we’ve done.\"\n\nPackage:\nThe package of 1 was intended to be simplistic and ambitious at the same time. Its cover was designed by Rick Ward and consists of a pop-art yellow number one on a red background. The emphasis on the 1 digit was used on many of the compilations of number-one hits by different artists that followed this album; for example, ELV1S by Elvis Presley or Number Ones by the Bee Gees. The album's back cover features the famous photos of the Beatles taken by Richard Avedon and copyrighted on 17 August 1967. The design exclusively uses variations of the Helvetica typeface.\n\n1 was released worldwide in CD and cassette. The vinyl format was released in only the United Kingdom. The CD includes a 32-page booklet with a colored page with international picture covers (a total of 163 covers are displayed on the whole booklet) and details (recording date, location, release date, chart stats) for each of the singles. It also includes on its first two pages a collage with 27 1s in different colours (all of them following the same art as the cover) with the sentence \"27 No. 1 singles = 1\" (which was used as a catch phrase for the promo ads for the album), and a foreword by George Martin.\n\nThe LP and cassette keep the main part of the CD version, but in a different form. The double vinyl record version was not released in the US, but the imported British edition was available. The vinyl version features a large full-color fold-out poster showing 126 picture sleeves (37 fewer than on the CD), and reproductions of the four Richard Avedon photos. The Avedon portraits also appear on the inside of the gatefold cover. The records have custom labels featuring the same graphics as the front cover and are packaged in custom inner sleeves. The deluxe packaging of the vinyl album, with its four portraits and poster, is reminiscent to that of their titular 1968 album. The cassette included a 20-page insert, including the college, the George Martin commentary and paged Avedon's portraits on its inlay and the whole description for the tracks as a total of 36 covers on its inlay reverse.\n\nRelease variations\n2000 CD.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five. He stated that there is \"no question that this is all great music,\" although to him \"there's really no reason for anyone who owns all the records to get this too.\"\n\nLegacy:\n1 would go on to inspire the release of a wave of compilation albums, in particular, three other \"number ones\" albums – Elvis Presley's ELV1S (2002), Michael Jackson's Number Ones (2003) and the Bee Gees' ELV1SNumber Ones (2004). Other compilations issued in its wake included Pink Floyd's 2-CD retrospective Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, Nirvana's Nirvana (2002), The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks (2002), The Who's The Ultimate Collection (2002), and Dean Martin's Dino: The Essential Dean Martin (2004).\n\nSales and chart performance:\nThe reception of 1 surpassed all critical and commercial expectations. It reached number 1 in over 35 countries, achieving the record for the album debuting at the top of the national charts ever. It became the highest-selling of 2000 and, sometime later, of the entire decade. This achievement made the Beatles the first and only artist to have the best-selling albums of two different decades. They also had the best-selling album of the 1960s, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. No tracks from Sgt. Pepper appear on this album. With this album, the Beatles also achieved having an album hit the number 1 position in the US in four non-consecutive decades (the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 1 became the Beatles' 15th number 1 album with sales of 319,126 copies (achieving record sales for only one week in 2000). On 18 December 2000, Ananova.com reported that the album has \"become 2000's biggest-selling album—in only five weeks.\" 1 was the first album to stay at the top spot for nine weeks in almost ten years (the last being the Eurythmics's Greatest Hits), the best-selling album of 2000, and the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s so far in the UK. In its eleventh week, 1 sold a total of two million copies in the UK. It spent a total of 46 weeks inside the Top 75. In July 2013 it was certified 10× platinum by the BPI, for over 3 million copies sold in the UK. It is the 21st best-selling album in the UK—according to an assessment by the Official Charts Company and the British Phonographic Industry that counted album sales in the UK from 28 July 1956 to the present day—, and the second best-selling Beatles album in that country (only beaten by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which is the UK's third best-selling album). As of July 2016, the album has sold over 3,230,000 copies in the UK.\n\nIn the United States, the response was similar. 1 debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 during the week of December 2, 2000, with sales totaling over 595,500 copies. In its second week, sales increased to 662,000 but Backstreet Boys' Black & Blue, which sold 1.59 million units, knocked it off the top spot, therefore, 1 fell off to number two on its week on the chart. The following week it stayed at number two selling 607,000 units, by doing so, the album became the sixth to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 and post a SoundScan increase in its second week and the first to do so after opening with a sum of more than half a million copies. During the week of December 23, 2000, its fourth week on the chart, 1 moved 671,000 copies and returned to the top of the Billboard 200. The next week, on December 30, 2000, it stayed at the top of the chart selling 823,500 copies. On February 10, 2001, after being the number one album for eight nonconsecutive weeks, 1 fell off to number four on the Billboard 200 with 173,500 units sold, a 19.5% dip in sales, by the time this happened the album had sold almost six million units. The album spent a total of eight weeks at number 1 and sold 1,258,667 copies during the week before Christmas of 2000. With this number, the Beatles achieved a new record: it was the seventh highest one-week sales in Soundscan history, the highest for an album not in its first week of sales, and the highest for an album comprising previously released music. The album spent 309 weeks inside the Billboard 200 and was the sixth best-selling album in the United States in 2000 with 5,100,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan. On August 30, 2011, the band announced through their Facebook account that the album was available to pre-order from iTunes and that it was digitally remastered. On September 24, 2011, after the album made its digital debut in the iTunes Store it re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number four selling 60,000 units, it also topped the iTunes album charts in the US, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, Switzerland, Spain, New Zealand, and Greece according to a Capitol/EMI press release. Its digital launch on the iTunes Store was accompanied by a price of $9.99 and a Twitter camping with the hashtag #MyBeatles1 asking their fans: What is your favorite \"1\" track? Resulting in many celebrities and stars posting their favorites, too. In 2015, after it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin, 1 re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number six selling 40,000 units. It was certified eleven times platinum by the RIAA on March 8, 2010, denoting shipments of eleven million units, and 1 is included on the list of the Top 100 Albums by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album is the best-selling album of the 21st century in the US and the fourth best-selling album in the Soundscan era (1991–present). As of February 2014, the album has had sold 12,410,000 copies in the US. In the US, the album secured the Beatles a fourth decade in which they placed an album at number 1 on the Billboard chart.\n\nIn Canada, 1 debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 54,668 copies in its first week. The album was certified Diamond (1,000,000 units) by the CRIA in February 2001, just four months after its release. As of 2009, 1 has sold 1,103,000 units in Canada, making it the fifth best-selling album ever in Canada of the Nielsen SoundScan era.\n\nIn Germany, 1 debuted at number 1 and managed to stay there nine non-consecutive weeks. Though this, it stayed only seventeen weeks in the top ten of the German Albums Chart, fifty weeks in the total chart. By selling 1,650,000 copies and reaching 11× Gold, it's the third best-selling album of the decade 2000–2009 and the best-selling non-German language album.\n\nIn 2009, Apple Corps, the Beatles' company, stated that worldwide sales of 1 had exceeded 31 million copies. Worldwide in 2000 the album sold 13.8 million copies, with 2 million or more copies sold during 2 consecutive weeks, and was the fourth best-selling album behind Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP, Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again, and Santana's Supernatural.\n\nTracklisting:\nLennon–McCartney wrote all songs, except \"Something\" by George Harrison, and those others as noted on the second DVD.

      "wiki_content": "1 is a compilation album by the English rock band the Beatles, originally released on 13 November 2000. The album features virtually every number-one single the band achieved in the United Kingdom and the United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on only one CD. 1 was a commercial success and topped the charts worldwide. It has sold over 31 million copies.\n\nIn addition, 1 is the fourth best-selling album in the US since Nielsen Sound Scan began tracking US album sales in January 1991 and the best-selling album of the decade (2000 to 2009) in the US, as well as the best-selling album of the decade worldwide. 1 was remastered and reissued in September 2011 and was remixed and reissued again in several different deluxe editions in November 2015, the most comprehensive of which is a three-disc set entitled 1+, which includes video discs of the band's music videos.\n\nAs of June 2015, 1 is the sixth best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK, having sold over 3.1 million copies.\n\nBackground:\nCompiled by producer George Martin and the (then) three surviving members of the band, 1 includes the 27 Beatles songs that went to number one in the United Kingdom on the Record Retailer Top 50 chart or in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It is worth noting, however, that the song \"For You Blue\" was listed on Billboard chart at number 1, along with the A-side \"The Long and Winding Road\", but Capitol Records treated \"For You Blue\" as strictly a B-side and did not promote it as an A-side. Meanwhile, \"Day Tripper\" was included on 1, since it charted at number 1 in the UK as a double A-side with \"We Can Work It Out,\" while in the US, only \"We Can Work It Out\" was number 1. Two notable singles released in both the UK and the US that did not reach number 1 in either country, and were therefore ineligible for inclusion on the album, were \"Please Please Me\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" (both reached number 2 in the UK charts, while in the US the former peaked at number 3, and the latter at number 8). The former was largely known as \"The Beatles' first UK number one single\"; however, it reached the top spot in the musical magazines New Musical Express and Melody Maker but not on the chart published by Record Retailer (now Music Week). On the other hand, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" was part of a double A-side single along with \"Penny Lane.\" This single had peaked at number 2 in the charts, behind Engelbert Humperdinck's single \"Release Me.\"\n\nThis album is essentially a combination of both the US and UK versions of the earlier album 20 Greatest Hits, with the addition of \"Something\" (which was left off 20 Greatest Hits because of time constraints). On 1, \"Hey Jude\" was released in its original full-length version (slightly over seven minutes); on the American version of 20 Greatest Hits it had been released as a shortened version.\n\nRemastering:\nBefore 1, all 27 songs were available mainly in two remastered CD versions. First, on the respective Beatles albums released in 1987 (as well as Past Masters, Volume One and Past Masters, Volume Two, released in 1988). The second remastering was made available on the CD versions for 1962–1966 and 1967–1970 (released in 1993).\n\nThe songs on 1 were remastered specifically for the release in 2000. According to the liner notes of the album, the original analog masters were \"digitally remastered at 24 bits resolution, processed using Sonic Solutions NoNoise technology and mastered to 16 bit using Prism SNS Noise Shaping.\" The remastering was overseen by Peter Mew of Abbey Road Studios and took place there. In 2011, 1 was remastered and reissued on CD. In 2015 it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin when Martin began to assist with fixing up the audio tracks for the 1+ video clips, he realized that his goal of making them “more immersive” should also apply to 1. For the remixing project, the remasters went back to the final mix tapes, remastered them, cleaned them up and then EQ-ed them and released them. About the remastering, Martin commented: \"My approach was to be respectful of everything, I had sessions and sessions where I flipped between previously remastered stereos, the mono remasters, and the remixes we’ve done. I flip between everything and make sure I prefer what we’ve done.\"\n\nPackage:\nThe package of 1 was intended to be simplistic and ambitious at the same time. Its cover was designed by Rick Ward and consists of a pop-art yellow number one on a red background. The emphasis on the 1 digit was used on many of the compilations of number-one hits by different artists that followed this album; for example, ELV1S by Elvis Presley or Number Ones by the Bee Gees. The album's back cover features the famous photos of the Beatles taken by Richard Avedon and copyrighted on 17 August 1967. The design exclusively uses variations of the Helvetica typeface.\n\n1 was released worldwide in CD and cassette. The vinyl format was released in only the United Kingdom. The CD includes a 32-page booklet with a colored page with international picture covers (a total of 163 covers are displayed on the whole booklet) and details (recording date, location, release date, chart stats) for each of the singles. It also includes on its first two pages a collage with 27 1s in different colours (all of them following the same art as the cover) with the sentence \"27 No. 1 singles = 1\" (which was used as a catch phrase for the promo ads for the album), and a foreword by George Martin.\n\nThe LP and cassette keep the main part of the CD version, but in a different form. The double vinyl record version was not released in the US, but the imported British edition was available. The vinyl version features a large full-color fold-out poster showing 126 picture sleeves (37 fewer than on the CD), and reproductions of the four Richard Avedon photos. The Avedon portraits also appear on the inside of the gatefold cover. The records have custom labels featuring the same graphics as the front cover and are packaged in custom inner sleeves. The deluxe packaging of the vinyl album, with its four portraits and poster, is reminiscent to that of their titular 1968 album. The cassette included a 20-page insert, including the college, the George Martin commentary and paged Avedon's portraits on its inlay and the whole description for the tracks as a total of 36 covers on its inlay reverse.\n\nRelease variations\n2000 CD. Apple 7243 5 29970 2 2 (Released in the UK only)\n2000 CD. Apple 7243 5 29325 2 8 (Worldwide release)\n2011 CD. (Remastered). Apple 50999 083070 2 6\n2015 CD. (Remixed). Apple 06025 475678 1 9 (as 1+ with two DVD or Blu-ray discs)\n\nOn 6 November 2015, Apple Records released a deluxe version of the original album, titled 1+. Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin, except the first three tracks, which are the original mono mixes. In addition to the new mixes, there are surround sound 5.1 mixes presented as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio in the Blu-ray version and Dolby Digital and DTS in the DVD version.\n\n1+ also includes 50 promotional films/performances, plus commentary and introductions from Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. All the videos have been digitally restored and enhanced. They are available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nVariations of 1/1+ include standard CD, CD/DVD, CD/Blu-ray, CD/2DVD, CD/2Blu-ray. The double-disc video editions also feature a 124-page hard-bound book with illustrations. The DVD/Blu-ray video editions are also available as a stand-alone package.\n\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource    Rating\nAllMusic    5/5 stars\nNME    9/10\nQ    4/5 stars\nMelody Maker    5/5 stars\n1 received universal acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five. He stated that there is \"no question that this is all great music,\" although to him \"there's really no reason for anyone who owns all the records to get this too.\"\n\nLegacy:\n1 would go on to inspire the release of a wave of compilation albums, in particular, three other \"number ones\" albums – Elvis Presley's ELV1S (2002), Michael Jackson's Number Ones (2003) and the Bee Gees' ELV1SNumber Ones (2004). Other compilations issued in its wake included Pink Floyd's 2-CD retrospective Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, Nirvana's Nirvana (2002), The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks (2002), The Who's The Ultimate Collection (2002), and Dean Martin's Dino: The Essential Dean Martin (2004).\n\nSales and chart performance:\nThe reception of 1 surpassed all critical and commercial expectations. It reached number 1 in over 35 countries, achieving the record for the album debuting at the top of the national charts ever. It became the highest-selling of 2000 and, sometime later, of the entire decade. This achievement made the Beatles the first and only artist to have the best-selling albums of two different decades. They also had the best-selling album of the 1960s, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. No tracks from Sgt. Pepper appear on this album. With this album, the Beatles also achieved having an album hit the number 1 position in the US in four non-consecutive decades (the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 1 became the Beatles' 15th number 1 album with sales of 319,126 copies (achieving record sales for only one week in 2000). On 18 December 2000, Ananova.com reported that the album has \"become 2000's biggest-selling album—in only five weeks.\" 1 was the first album to stay at the top spot for nine weeks in almost ten years (the last being the Eurythmics's Greatest Hits), the best-selling album of 2000, and the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s so far in the UK. In its eleventh week, 1 sold a total of two million copies in the UK. It spent a total of 46 weeks inside the Top 75. In July 2013 it was certified 10× platinum by the BPI, for over 3 million copies sold in the UK. It is the 21st best-selling album in the UK—according to an assessment by the Official Charts Company and the British Phonographic Industry that counted album sales in the UK from 28 July 1956 to the present day—, and the second best-selling Beatles album in that country (only beaten by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which is the UK's third best-selling album). As of July 2016, the album has sold over 3,230,000 copies in the UK.\n\nIn the United States, the response was similar. 1 debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 during the week of December 2, 2000, with sales totaling over 595,500 copies. In its second week, sales increased to 662,000 but Backstreet Boys' Black & Blue, which sold 1.59 million units, knocked it off the top spot, therefore, 1 fell off to number two on its week on the chart. The following week it stayed at number two selling 607,000 units, by doing so, the album became the sixth to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 and post a SoundScan increase in its second week and the first to do so after opening with a sum of more than half a million copies. During the week of December 23, 2000, its fourth week on the chart, 1 moved 671,000 copies and returned to the top of the Billboard 200. The next week, on December 30, 2000, it stayed at the top of the chart selling 823,500 copies. On February 10, 2001, after being the number one album for eight nonconsecutive weeks, 1 fell off to number four on the Billboard 200 with 173,500 units sold, a 19.5% dip in sales, by the time this happened the album had sold almost six million units. The album spent a total of eight weeks at number 1 and sold 1,258,667 copies during the week before Christmas of 2000. With this number, the Beatles achieved a new record: it was the seventh highest one-week sales in Soundscan history, the highest for an album not in its first week of sales, and the highest for an album comprising previously released music. The album spent 309 weeks inside the Billboard 200 and was the sixth best-selling album in the United States in 2000 with 5,100,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan. On August 30, 2011, the band announced through their Facebook account that the album was available to pre-order from iTunes and that it was digitally remastered. On September 24, 2011, after the album made its digital debut in the iTunes Store it re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number four selling 60,000 units, it also topped the iTunes album charts in the US, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, Switzerland, Spain, New Zealand, and Greece according to a Capitol/EMI press release. Its digital launch on the iTunes Store was accompanied by a price of $9.99 and a Twitter camping with the hashtag #MyBeatles1 asking their fans: What is your favorite \"1\" track? Resulting in many celebrities and stars posting their favorites, too. In 2015, after it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin, 1 re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number six selling 40,000 units. It was certified eleven times platinum by the RIAA on March 8, 2010, denoting shipments of eleven million units, and 1 is included on the list of the Top 100 Albums by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album is the best-selling album of the 21st century in the US and the fourth best-selling album in the Soundscan era (1991–present). As of February 2014, the album has had sold 12,410,000 copies in the US. In the US, the album secured the Beatles a fourth decade in which they placed an album at number 1 on the Billboard chart.\n\nIn Canada, 1 debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 54,668 copies in its first week. The album was certified Diamond (1,000,000 units) by the CRIA in February 2001, just four months after its release. As of 2009, 1 has sold 1,103,000 units in Canada, making it the fifth best-selling album ever in Canada of the Nielsen SoundScan era.\n\nIn Germany, 1 debuted at number 1 and managed to stay there nine non-consecutive weeks. Though this, it stayed only seventeen weeks in the top ten of the German Albums Chart, fifty weeks in the total chart. By selling 1,650,000 copies and reaching 11× Gold, it's the third best-selling album of the decade 2000–2009 and the best-selling non-German language album.\n\nIn 2009, Apple Corps, the Beatles' company, stated that worldwide sales of 1 had exceeded 31 million copies. Worldwide in 2000 the album sold 13.8 million copies, with 2 million or more copies sold during 2 consecutive weeks, and was the fourth best-selling album behind Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP, Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again, and Santana's Supernatural.\n\nTracklisting:\nLennon–McCartney wrote all songs, except \"Something\" by George Harrison, and those others as noted on the second DVD.
