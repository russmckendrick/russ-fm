      "biography": "Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals). They have had eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums, and won fifteen NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for outstanding contribution to music and one for the best album of the last 30 years as voted by the BBC Radio 2 listeners; they have been nominated for three Grammy Awards. As of 2009, the band have sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide. The band were listed in the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010 for \"Longest Top 10 UK Chart Run by a Group\" after an unprecedented run of 22 top 10 hits in the UK. The band also holds the Guinness World Record for being the most successful act in the UK between the years 1995 and 2005, spending 765 weeks in the Top 75 singles and albums charts.\nIts members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and afterwards released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994. The following year, the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with their new drummer Alan White in the midst of rivalry with Britpop peers Blur in the charts. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now, and although it became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly. The band lost members Paul McGuigan and Paul Arthurs as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants in 2000 and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the tour in support of Giants. The band found renewed success and popularity starting with 2005's Don't Believe the Truth. In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band after a backstage altercation with Liam before a festival appearance. The band, comprising the remaining members of Oasis and led by Liam Gallagher, decided to continue working together under the name Beady Eye, while Noel went on to form his solo project Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.\nOasis evolved from an earlier band called The Rain, composed of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster that hung in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the poster listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon, Wiltshire.\nOasis played their first ever live gig on 18 August 1991 at the Boardwalk club in Manchester. Liam's brother Noel Gallagher, who was a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, he did begin to consider the possibility of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he'd been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. \"He had loads of stuff written,\" Arthurs recalled. \"When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.\" Oasis under Noel Gallagher crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity, with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barred chords and root bass notes; McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound \"so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable.\"\nAfter over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a proper demo (known as the Live Demonstration tape), the band's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner Alan McGee. Oasis were invited to play a gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut club in Glasgow, Scotland, by a band called Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, found the money to hire a van and make the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club as they were not on that night's set list, which reportedly caused the band to bully their way in (although both the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they actually managed to get into the club on that night). They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see 18 Wheeler, one of his own bands, that night. McGee was so impressed by what he saw he signed the band to Creation four days later. Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis ended up signing a worldwide contract with Sony, which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.\nFollowing a limited white label release of the demo of their song \"Columbia\", their first single, \"Supersonic\", was released in April 1994, reaching number 31 in the charts. The release was followed by \"Shakermaker\". This song would become the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, \"Live Forever\", was their first to enter the top ten of the UK charts. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in September 1994, entering the charts at number one, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.\nThe best part of a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a hedonistic lifestyle, were taking their toll on the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994 where Liam was under the influence of crystal meth, leading to an inept performance during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and assaulted Noel with a tambourine. The incident upset Noel to such an extent that he temporarily quit the band immediately after and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident that the song \"Talk Tonight\" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, Gallagher was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with his brother and the tour resumed in Minneapolis. The group followed up the fourth single from Definitely Maybe, \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\", with the Christmas single \"Whatever\", which entered the British charts at number three. This song would later carry a co-writer's credit for Neil Innes, who sued and also won damages.",

      "editorial_notes": "The gargantuan success of Oasis’s second album, <i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?</i>, might have made its 1997 follow-up one of the most feverishly anticipated records of the ’90s, but chief songwriter, guitarist and sometime-singer Noel Gallagher wasn’t exactly cowed by the challenge. Instead, he set out to make a grandiose rock ’n’ roll record befitting of the Manchester five-piece’s new status. It had been a rapid elevation: Just three years after the release of their game-changing debut <i>Definitely Maybe</i>, Oasis were now one of the world’s biggest bands.\n\nNo wonder the group felt like they’d earned the right to think big. A few months before sessions began in October 1996 at London’s Abbey Road Studios, a choice of location that hammered home how keen Oasis were to cement their reputation as The Beatles’ rightful heirs, Oasis had played two era-defining, record-breaking gigs at Knebworth House in Hertfordshire. They were on top of the world, and there was zero chance that they were going to follow up such monumental highs with a record that stripped things back. <i>Be Here Now</i> was all about making their sound bigger and more bombastic, aiming for anthems fit for the sort of band who played to 250,000 people in one weekend.\n\nThe songs had come together a few months before that epochal summer. During some time off in Mustique, holed up in Mick Jagger’s pad, Noel was determined to work his way out of a period of writer’s block. He hit his stride to the point that <i>…Morning Glory?</i> producer Owen Morris joined him after two weeks, and the two laid down a series of demos with Noel playing all the instruments.\n\nThe band would use those versions as a template while getting down to work in Abbey Road and then Surrey’s Ridge Farm Studio, where they decamped in order to escape the media attention they’d attracted at Abbey Road. The tabloids weren’t their only issue though: Recording sessions were clouded by rampant drug use, with a cocaine-addled Noel reaching a conclusion that everything needed to be as epic and colossal as possible. These were productions impossible to see to the bottom of, with a seemingly infinite layer of guitar overdubs coated over everything.\n\nLuckily, Noel’s sense of melodicism had not abandoned him. There are some songs on <i>Be Here Now</i> that might not have stood up on <i>Definitely Maybe</i> or <i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?</i> or even on their spotless B-sides collection <i>The Masterplan</i>—tracks never revisited by Oasis, or by Noel and his singer brother Liam in their respective solo careers. But there are also frequent moments of prime Oasis. The ballads here are some of their most sumptuous, from the orchestral sway of “Stand By Me” to the minor-chord splendour of “Don’t Go Away”, while lead single “D’You Know What I Mean?” was a moody, widescreen rocker that perfectly paired huge hooks with dynamic, deft sonics. On the rollicking title track—a glorious union of jagged guitars and surly vocals—they showed there was still no one to touch them when they clicked into gear.\n\nThe song that best summed up where Oasis were at as they made <i>Be Here Now</i>, though, was a nine-minute monster near the album’s end. “All Around the World” had been written by Noel years before, pre-dating the band signing a record deal. Here it was retooled as their most ambitious cut yet, its tuneful, Beatles-y hook growing ever more potent with each key change, a surging string section lifting it skyward.\n\nWere Oasis put on this earth to deliver nine-minute ’60s pop psychedelia? Possibly not, but as a snapshot of a band working out where to go when you’ve reached the top, <i>Be Here Now</i> remains an enthralling, sometimes brilliant listen. Its success confirmed what everyone knew, especially the band themselves: This juggernaut was unstoppable. It became the fastest-selling album in British history and the biggest of 1997, while its entry at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart underlined the inroads they’d made on the other side of the Atlantic. But its success couldn’t mask the unease Noel Gallagher soon felt about his band’s third album. Next would come a rethink and a change in line-up. The first era of Oasis—the one where they took over the world—was coming to a close.",
