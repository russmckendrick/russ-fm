      "biography": "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

      "editorial_notes": "As Thom Yorke sat down to type out the lyrics to “A Wolf at the Door”—the near-rap that ends Radiohead’s sixth album, <i>Hail to the Thief</i>—for artist Stanley Donwood, the singer was stunned by the cumulative violence of the images: knives in necks, Stepford wives and clandestine mistresses, dead people dragged through windows. But all that danger and anger was in the air as Radiohead plotted and recorded this dark 2003 effort, its title a reference to George W. Bush’s electoral hijinks, and its songs written and recorded as the United States began its post-9/11 assaults. And on <i>Hail to the Thief</i>, the angst of that era is everywhere: There’s the Orwellian logic of “2 + 2 = 5”, the nuclear fallout of “I Will” and the plagued race of “Myxomatosis”, named for an especially fatal rabbit pox. Perhaps it was the cumulative effect of early-2000s despair that had inspired Yorke’s bleak lyrics? “Rather than waking you up and it’s like, ‘Uhh, it’s all been a lovely dream,’” the singer later confirmed, “it’s all been a nightmare, and you need to go and get a glass of water now.”\n\nFollowing the creative successes of <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i>—which found the members of Radiohead rethinking their approach to the studio—the group once again shook things up on <i>Hail to the Thief</i>. In 2002, Yorke and his bandmates decamped to the famed Ocean Way in Los Angeles for two weeks, recording a song every day. For the first time in years, they had real fun, indulging not only in the sunshine outside but in the studio’s big room, where they worked as a cohesive quintet. While still testing out equipment, the group laid down the track that would become “2 + 2 = 5”—and the song’s incisive riff, falsetto vocals and rhythmic tricks set the stage for <i>Hail to the Thief</i>’s scope. This is an album that finds Radiohead approaching familiar rock territory, from the momentous strum-and-drum anthem “Go to Sleep” to the chiming notes of “Scatterbrain”. But witness the tape-splice wizardry and big beat of “The Gloaming”, or the whirring circuits and clipped rhythms of “Backdrifts”: This is a band that, having ventured far beyond recognisable comforts after <i>OK Computer</i>, was now moving deliberately and defiantly toward the center—at least for a spell.\n\nThere’s no Radiohead record more vitriolic, nor more emotionally persuasive, than <i>Hail to the Thief</i>—which is fitting, given that it was birthed in a political climate that felt poised to end the world. The dystopian nightmares Radiohead had voiced on every record from the start were coming true—and an ending Yorke had long predicted now seemed to be in bloom. “We are not the same as you,” he sings during “The Gloaming”, drawing a line between those defending the world and those destroying it. With big drums and damning language, strangling solos and corroded electronics, <i>Hail to the Thief</i> is Radiohead’s fight music.",

For the first time in years, they had real fun, indulging not only in the sunshine outside but in the studio’s big room, where they worked as a cohesive quintet. While still testing out equipment, the group laid down the track that would become “2 + 2 = 5”—and the song’s incisive riff, falsetto vocals and rhythmic tricks set the stage for <i>Hail to the Thief</i>’s scope. This is an album that finds Radiohead approaching familiar rock territory, from the momentous strum-and-drum anthem “Go to Sleep” to the chiming notes of “Scatterbrain”. But witness the tape-splice wizardry and big beat of “The Gloaming”, or the whirring circuits and clipped rhythms of “Backdrifts”: This is a band that, having ventured far beyond recognisable comforts after <i>OK Computer</i>, was now moving deliberately and defiantly toward the center—at least for a spell.\n\nThere’s no Radiohead record more vitriolic, nor more emotionally persuasive, than <i>Hail to the Thief</i>—which is fitting, given that it was birthed in a political climate that felt poised to end the world. The dystopian nightmares Radiohead had voiced on every record from the start were coming true—and an ending Yorke had long predicted now seemed to be in bloom. “We are not the same as you,” he sings during “The Gloaming”, drawing a line between those defending the world and those destroying it. With big drums and damning language, strangling solos and corroded electronics, <i>Hail to the Thief</i> is Radiohead’s fight music."

            "content": "Hail to the Thief (subtitled The Gloaming, written as Hail to the Thief, (or, The Gloaming.) in the album booklet) is the sixth studio album by English rock band Radiohead, released on 9 June 2003 in the United Kingdom and 10 June 2003, in the United States. It debuted at number one in the UK and at number three in the United States.\n\nAfter two Radiohead albums that featured heavily processed vocals, less guitar, and strong influence from experimental electronica and jazz, Hail to the Thief was seen as a return to alternative rock, drawing its sound from every era of the band's existence. Preceded by the single \"There There. (The Boney King of Nowhere.)\", the album reached number one on the UK charts, and met with modest but worldwide commercial success, selling 994,000 units in the United States.\n\nBand members described the album as having a more \"swaggering\" sound and a relaxed recording process, in contrast to the tense Kid A and Amnesiac sessions. At nearly an hour in length, Hail to the Thief is the band's longest album, although many of its songs are within the three- and even two-minute range, shorter than the band's average. Thom Yorke said he was inspired by Beatles songs of that length which he thought felt much longer. This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.\n\nThe album received universal acclaim from professional critics upon release, based on a Metacritic score of 85/100, or 85%. Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, called it \"Radiohead firing on all cylinders, a major work by major artists at the height of their powers\", and the record performed typically well in magazines' end-of-year lists, especially in the United States. It was the fifth straight Radiohead release to be nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative Album. Unswayed, the NME's James Oldham saw it as \"a good rather than great record\" and Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called it \"neither startlingly different and fresh nor packed with the sort of anthemic songs that once made them the world's biggest band.\" In 2004, coproducer Nigel Godrich and engineer Darrell Thorp were honoured with Grammy Awards for their work on Hail to the Thief.\n\nLike the album itself, every song on the album has two titles. The intended titling for the album is as follows:\n\n1. 2 + 2 = 5. (The Lukewarm.) - 3:19\n2. Sit Down. Stand Up. (Snakes & Ladders.) - 4:20\n3. Sail to the Moon. (Brush the Cobwebs out of the Sky.) - 4:18\n4. Backdrifts. (Honeymoon Is Over.) - 5:23\n5. Go to Sleep. (Little Man Being Erased.) - 3:22\n6. Where I End and You Begin. (The Sky Is Falling In.) - 4:29\n7. We Suck Young Blood. (Your Time Is Up.) - 4:57\n8. The Gloaming. (Softly Open Our Mouths in the Cold.) - 3:32\n9. There There. (The Boney King of Nowhere.) - 5:24\n10. I Will. (No Man's Land.) - 1:59\n11. A Punchup at a Wedding. (No no no no no no no no.) - 4:57\n12. Myxomatosis. (Judge, Jury & Executioner.) - 3:53\n13. Scatterbrain. (As Dead as Leaves.) - 3:22\n14. A Wolf at the Door. (It Girl. Rag Doll.) - 3:21\n\nHowever, due to a misprint in the album artwork, there was no period after the \"5\" in \"2 + 2 = 5\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Hail+to+the+Thief\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
