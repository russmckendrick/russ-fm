      "biography": "New Order are an English new wave/synthpop band which formed in 1980 in Salford, England, United Kingdom by the three remaining members of Joy Division. The band's classic lineup consists of Bernard Sumner (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Peter Hook (bass, electronic percussion), Gillian Gilbert (keyboards, guitar) and Stephen Morris (drums, keyboards). The group effectively disbanded in 1993 but reformed in 1998. Gilbert left in 2001 to look after her and Morris' children and was replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Phil Cunningham. Hook left acrimoniously in 2007 and declared the band to be defunct. Initially, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris denied the band had split up, but in 2009, following the release of the trio's Bad Lieutenant album, they admitted that that they could not continue on without Hook and officially disbanded. However, the band reformed in 2011 for a pair of charity dates without Hook, with Gilbert returning to the fold and Tom Chapman replacing Hook on bass. \n\nPioneers of dance music in the 1980s and one of the first bands to effectively and popularly synthesize keyboard- and guitar-based music, New Order's members hailed from Salford and Macclesfield, England out of the ashes of Joy Division, are noted as being one of the first bands to bridge the gap between Post-Punk and Dancefloor. They were Factory Records' highest selling artist. They also funded Factory's famous Manchester club, The Haçienda. The band partnered with Quincy Jones's American label Qwest, recorded with legendary hip-hop producer Arthur Baker (on 1983's single \"Confusion\" and 1984's \"Thieves Like Us\"), and they embraced Ibizan club culture on the album, Technique.\n\nThe band was formed in 1980 by the three surviving members, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris of Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide. Morris' girlfriend (and later wife) Gillian Gilbert joined in October 1980 on keyboards and occasional guitar shortly after contributing guitar to the second release of New Order's first single \"Ceremony\". Their early music followed in the same vein as Joy Division, most notably on debut album Movement. This is mostly seen now as a 'transitional' album where the new 4-piece band was trying to find a new identity.\n\nThey continued to develop their music and their identity with tracks such as \"Procession\" and \"Temptation\" until 1983 when, under the influence of early electro funk and Italo-Disco tracks (most notably Klein & MBO's Dirty Talk), they released \"Blue Monday\", arguably their most famous song and the biggest-selling 12\" single of all time. This came in such a detailed Peter Saville-designed sleeve (replicating a floppy disc) that it is claimed by some that the band's record company, Factory, lost money on every copy sold. \n\nThe release of \"Blue Monday\" coincided with the album Power, Corruption & Lies which further developed their dance/rock crossover. Other albums followed in 1985 (Low-Life), 1986 (Brotherhood) and 1989 (Technique, influenced heavily by Ibiza's acid house scene). In 1990 the band scored their sole number 1 hit with a song written by Keith Allen and performed with the England football team, \"World in Motion\", the official England World Cup song.  One more album, Republic followed in May 1993, which was released by London Records after the collapse of Factory in November 1992.\n\nThe band effectively split in 1993 to pursue solo projects, but returned with a triumphant gig at the Reading Festival in 1998. After the recording of 2001's Get Ready album Gillian Gilbert left the band amicably for family reasons - her and Stephen's daughter Grace had been diagnosed with Transverse myelitis and she came to the decision that it would be easier for the band to replace her than her husband. They have since gone on to produce one more album with the help of Phil Cunningham of Marion when they released their last album, Waiting For The Sirens' Call.\n\nHook left acrimoniously in 2007 and according to him, the band has effectively broken up. However, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris repeatedly denied that the band was over, and that if Hook no longer wanted to be in the band, that was his choice. Hook has since threatened to take legal action if they attempt to continue as New Order. In 2009, Sumner, Morris and Cunningham announced that they did not plan on continuing on as New Order without Hook. However, in September 2011 it was announced that they will reform as New Order for two concerts in October (Brussels and Paris), without Hook but with Gillian Gilbert. Hook's replacement is Tom Chapman, who is also in Bad Lieutenant with Sumner, Morris and Cunningham. The charity gigs in Brussels and Paris were very successful and New Order decided to go on tour in 2012. They played various concerts all over the world and also some big festivals in the summer.\n\nDiscography (studio albums):\nMovement (1981)\nPower, Corruption & Lies (1983)\nLow-Life (1985)\nBrotherhood (1986)\nTechnique (1989)\nRepublic (1993)\nGet Ready (2001)\nWaiting for the Sirens' Call (2005)\nLost Sirens (2013)\nMusic Complete (2015)\n \nCollaborations and other projects:\nShortly after the split, Sumner and Cunningham formed Bad Lieutenant. The band's debut album Never Cry Another Tear, released in 2009, features Morris on drums on several tracks, although he is not an official member of the band and has committed to continue musical projects with Gillian Gilbert. The band's various solo projects understandably seemed to contain elements of the New Order 'sound', and gave some clues as to each member's contribution to the band.\n\nBernard Sumner worked with Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths) and Neil Tennant (of The Pet Shop Boys) in the 'supergroup', Electronic. Peter Hook formed the bands Revenge and, later, Monaco. These projects gained some commercial success. Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert recorded two albums of songs as The Other Two, and also did scoring work for film and television. \n\nEach of New Order's four original members have, at various times, acted as producers and/or guest musicians under the moniker of Be Music for a myriad of Factory labelmates and other artists, including: Section 25, A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, Paul Haig, The Stockholm Monsters, The Stone Roses, and Stanton Miranda.\n\n2) New Order were a K-Pop group who released one album titled 5 2001317-9 on April 18th, 2001. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/New+Order\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "As a new century was getting underway, New Order returned with its hardest-rocking album yet: 2001’s <i>Get Ready</i>. The shift in sound was largely due to the fact that Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris—traditionally the more electronic-leaning members—were absent from the studio, leaving the rock-centric bassist Peter Hook and guitarist-singer Bernard Sumner on their own. They’d get assistance from producer Steve Osborne, who’d helped Lush transcend their shoegaze style on 1996’s <i>Lovelife</i> before working with rockers like U2, Starsailor and Doves. Osborne was also an accomplished remixer, one who was comfortable at the exact intersection of rock and dance. As a result, <i>Get Ready</i> would fit in neatly with the emerging rock revival of the early 2000s, with the album‘s slashing, guitar-sharpened lead single “Crystal” arriving right around the time The Strokes released their debut album. Once again, New Order was in the middle of the zeitgeist.\n\nThis new approach wasn’t completely out of nowhere. The more muscular tone found on <i>Get Ready</i> was already evident when Osborne and the band recorded the song “Brutal”—an artefact of late-stage alternative music and late-90s electronica if there ever was one—for Danny Boyle’s 2000 film, <i>The Beach</i>. And the aggro spirit of <i>Get Ready</i> was amplified by cameos from the likes of Billy Corgan, the guitar god and alt-rock outcast who lent his voice for “Turn My Way”, and who toured with the band for several <i>Get Ready</i> dates (though he sometimes hid at the back of the stage, his iconic dome hidden by a large hat). Another boost came from Primal Scream guitarist Andrew Innes, who added wailing wah-wah to “Rock the Shack”, while his bandmate Bobby Gillespie added vocals. The resulting noise was unlike anything New Order had done before—or since.",

          "short": "The band kicks off the 2000s with big riffs and a few big-name guests.",
          "standard": "As a new century was getting underway, New Order returned with its hardest-rocking album yet: 2001’s <i>Get Ready</i>. The shift in sound was largely due to the fact that Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris—traditionally the more electronic-leaning members—were absent from the studio, leaving the rock-centric bassist Peter Hook and guitarist-singer Bernard Sumner on their own. They’d get assistance from producer Steve Osborne, who’d helped Lush transcend their shoegaze style on 1996’s <i>Lovelife</i> before working with rockers like U2, Starsailor and Doves. Osborne was also an accomplished remixer, one who was comfortable at the exact intersection of rock and dance. As a result, <i>Get Ready</i> would fit in neatly with the emerging rock revival of the early 2000s, with the album‘s slashing, guitar-sharpened lead single “Crystal” arriving right around the time The Strokes released their debut album. Once again, New Order was in the middle of the zeitgeist.\n\nThis new approach wasn’t completely out of nowhere. The more muscular tone found on <i>Get Ready</i> was already evident when Osborne and the band recorded the song “Brutal”—an artefact of late-stage alternative music and late-90s electronica if there ever was one—for Danny Boyle’s 2000 film, <i>The Beach</i>. And the aggro spirit of <i>Get Ready</i> was amplified by cameos from the likes of Billy Corgan, the guitar god and alt-rock outcast who lent his voice for “Turn My Way”, and who toured with the band for several <i>Get Ready</i> dates (though he sometimes hid at the back of the stage, his iconic dome hidden by a large hat). Another boost came from Primal Scream guitarist Andrew Innes, who added wailing wah-wah to “Rock the Shack”, while his bandmate Bobby Gillespie added vocals. The resulting noise was unlike anything New Order had done before—or since."
