  "biography": "The Jam were a punk/mod revival group formed in Woking, England in 1972 consisting of Paul Weller (vocals, guitar), Bruce Foxton (bass, vocals) and Rick Buckler (drums). Weller left the band in 1982  effectively ending The Jam. The Jam released six albums and had 18 consecutive Top 40 hits in the United Kingdom between 1977 and 1982, including four #1 singles (Going Underground, Start!, Town Called Malice and Beat Surrender). Their singles \"That's Entertainment\" and \"Just Who Is the Five O'Clock Hero\" are the best selling import singles in UK history.\n\nThe band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1960s beat music, soul, rhythm and blues and psychedelic rock, as well as 1970s punk and new wave. The trio was known for its melodic pop songs, its distinctly English flavour and its mod image. The band launched the career of Paul Weller, who went on to form The Style Council and later had a successful solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of The Jam’s original compositions, and he played lead guitar, using a Rickenbacker. Bruce Foxton provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band’s songs, including the hits \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\", \"The Eton Rifles\", \"Going Underground\" and \"Town Called Malice\".\n\nFor artists called \"Jam\", please see http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jam. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jam\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
