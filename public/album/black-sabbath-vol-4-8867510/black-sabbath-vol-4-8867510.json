      "biography": "Black Sabbath were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes following Osbourne's departure in 1979 and Iommi is the only constant member throughout their history.\n\nAfter previous iterations of the group – the Polka Tulk Blues Band and Earth – the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and down-tuned guitars. Signing to Philips Records in November 1969, they released their first single, \"Evil Woman\", in January 1970, and their debut album, Black Sabbath, was released the following month. Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, Paranoid, later that year. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, critics were starting to respond favourably.\n\nOsbourne's excessive substance abuse led to his firing in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. Martin, who replaced Gillen in 1987, was the second-longest serving vocalist and recorded three albums with Black Sabbath before his dismissal in 1991. That same year, Iommi and Butler were rejoined by Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer (1992). After two more studio albums with Martin, who replaced Dio in 1993, the band's original line-up reunited in 1997 and released a live album, Reunion, the following year; they continued to tour occasionally until 2005. Other than various back catalogue reissues and compilation albums, as well as the Mob Rules-era line-up reunited as Heaven & Hell, there was no further activity under the Black Sabbath name until 2011 with the release of their final studio album and 19th overall, 13, in 2013, which features all of the original members except Ward. During their farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017. Occasional partial reunions have happened since, most recently when Osbourne and Iommi performed together at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.\n\nBlack Sabbath have sold over 70 million records worldwide as of 2013, making them one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands. Black Sabbath, together with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\". They were ranked by MTV as the \"Greatest Metal Band of All Time\" and placed second on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 on their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance, and in 2019 the band were presented a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",

      "editorial_notes": "You can’t accuse Black Sabbath of false advertising. The group members wanted to call their fourth album <i>Snowblind</i>, after their cocaine-inspired song of the same name, only to be turned down by their record company. But really—<i>all</i> of <i>Vol. 4</i> was inspired by cocaine. The bandmates were up to their eyeballs in the stuff at the Bel Air mansion where they wrote most of the songs (a mansion that happened to be owned by DuPont chemical heir—and future convicted murderer—John du Pont). They had speaker cabinets full of coke delivered to the recording studio, and guitarist Tony Iommi wrote the neo-classical interlude “Laguna Sunrise” after staying up all night on you-know-what. Sabbath even thank “the great COKE-cola company of Los Angeles” in the credits.\n\nSomehow, the band’s massive drug intake didn’t affect the quality of the songwriting. Released in 1972, and produced mostly by Iommi, <i>Vol. 4</i> has some of the band’s most ferocious and memorable songs. It starts out with “Wheels of Confusion”, a mercurial meditation on alienation that segues into the bombastic instrumental “The Straightener”—a bit of a proggy throwback to Sabbath’s first two albums. The album then strips down to the rolling thunder kiss-off of “Tomorrow’s Dream”; killer and concise, it was the album’s sole single.\n\nThe ballad “Changes,” meanwhile, is a unique collaboration among the four members: Self-taught pianist Iommi tickled the ivories; singer Ozzy Osbourne wrote the vocal melody; and bassist Geezer Butler wrote the lyrics, which were based on drummer Bill Ward’s crumbling marriage. It remains one of the most plaintive and melancholy songs in the band’s catalogue. For a man who wrote so many of heavy metal’s all-time greatest riffs, the one Iommi carved off for “Supernaut” is a showstopper. Dizzying and circular, it propels one of the most infectious songs Sabbath ever wrote. A favourite of Led Zeppelin’s John Bonham—as well of unlikely Sabbath fan Frank Zappa—the track also features a carnival-esque breakdown from Ward.\n\nStill, “Snowblind” is <i>Vol. 4</i>’s centrepiece. With lyrics by Butler, it also might be the most poetic and empathetic song about being high on the devil’s dandruff: “Something blowin’ in my head/Winds of ice that soon will spread,” Ozzy sings over a chilling Iommi riff, “Down to freeze my very soul/Makes me happy, makes me cold.”\n\nElsewhere on <i>Vol. 4</i>,“Cornucopia” churns with ominous inevitability and offers a warning about the illusion of materialistic pleasures. “St. Vitus Dance” might seem like a reference to what we’d now call restless leg syndrome, but the lyrics detail a romantic relationship broken on the wheel of paranoia. And the closing track, “Under the Sun”, is an anti-religious, anti-authoritarian song with a deep, rumbling riff that helped plant the seed of modern doom metal. More importantly, it set the stage for what might be Sabbath’s crowning achievement: <i>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</i>.",
