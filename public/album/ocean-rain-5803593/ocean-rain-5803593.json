      "biography": "Echo & the Bunnymen are a British post-punk band formed in Liverpool in 1978. The original line-up consisted of Ian McCulloch, Will Sergeant and Les Pattinson. There are many stories, probably apocryphal, that the quartet was completed by a drum machine known as \"Echo\".\n\nTheir debut album is 1980's Crocodiles, and their next, the critically-acclaimed Heaven Up Here, reached the Top Ten in 1981. So did 1983's  Porcupine and '84's  Ocean Rain. Singles like The Killing Moon and Silver helped keep the group in the public eye as they took a brief hiatus in the late 1980s. Their 1987 self-titled LP was a small American hit, their only LP to have significant sales there.\n\nMcCulloch quit the band in 1988. De Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident one year later. The others decided to continue, recruiting Noel Burke to replace McCulloch which did not generate much excitement among fans or critics. Burke, Sargeant and Pattinson split after that, but the surviving three fourths of the original band reformed in 1997and released Evergreen, What are You Going to Do with Your Life, Siberia, and the latest addition, The Fountain. The group's old audience liked the return to their classic sound, and they also managed to gain a number of new, younger listeners.\n\nEcho and the Bunnymen were managed early on by Bill Drummond, who went on to be a founder member of The KLF. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Echo+&+the+Bunnymen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Since 1984 the album has been certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. Ocean Rain includes the singles \"The Killing Moon\", \"Silver\" and \"Seven Seas\".\n\nThe band wrote the songs for the new album in 1983. In early 1984 they recorded most of the album in Paris using a 35-piece orchestra, with other sessions taking place in Bath and Liverpool. Receiving mixed reviews the album was originally released as an LP and a cassette in May 1984 before it was reissued on CD in August. The album was reissued on CD in 2003, along with the other four of the band's first five studio albums, having been remastered and expanded before again being reissued in 2008 with a live bonus disc. The artwork for the album was designed by Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin. Echo & the Bunnymen played a number of concerts in 2008 where they performed Ocean Rain in full and with the backing of an orchestra. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Echo+&+the+Bunnymen/Ocean+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
