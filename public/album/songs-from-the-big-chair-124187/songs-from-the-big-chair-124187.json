      "biography": "Tears for Fears are an English rock band formed in 1981 by Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith.\nFounded after the dissolution of their first band, the mod-influenced Graduate, they were initially associated with the New Wave synthesizer bands of the early 1980s but later branched out into mainstream rock and pop, which led to international chart success.\nTheir platinum-selling debut album, The Hurting, reached number one on the UK Album Chart, while their second album, Songs from the Big Chair, reached number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, achieving multi-platinum status in both the UK and the United States. Following the release of their third platinum-selling album, The Seeds of Love (1989), Smith and Orzabal parted company in 1991, though Orzabal retained the Tears for Fears name throughout the remainder of the 1990s. The duo re-formed in 2000, and released an album of new material, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, in 2004. To date, Tears for Fears have sold over 25 million albums worldwide, including more than 8 million in the U.S.",

      "editorial_notes": "When Tears for Fears convened to make their second album in 1984, they were young, ambitious and dead set on making sure the world knew they were something more than the Thompson Twins or Duran Duran. Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal’s first album under that name, 1983’s <i>The Hurting</i>, was some of the bleakest music to make a commercial impression since Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, bridging the introversion of goth with the extroversion of pop. <i>Songs From the Big Chair</i> was more polished and more accessible, too, but still sounded out of sync with the prevailing trends of the time—too big, too complex, too intellectually loaded. Where <i>The Hurting</i> had explored ideas about trauma repression and inner darkness, <i>Chair</i> cast its eyes outward. These aren’t songs, they’re billboards: “Shout, shout, let it all out!”; “Everybody wants to rule the world!” The words are clear and the melodies broad, but the treatment is sophisticated enough that the band still scanned as highbrow no matter how many arenas they booked. Smith and Orzabal knew what Depeche Mode and Soft Cell were up to, but remained more interested in stuff like Peter Gabriel, spending 10 hours a day in the studio trimming trees without ever losing sight of the forest.<br />\nAs synonymous as the album is in the collective memory with ’80s music, the reality is that <i>Chair</i> is a hodgepodge. Isolate the tracks from their context and you can hear industrial music (“Shout”), jazz ballads (“I Believe”), new-age (“Listen”) and ’60s-style pop (“Everybody Wants to Rule the World”)—a mix so discontinuous that the band said the album’s name was meant to nudge listeners towards the idea that this was more of a collection (“Songs From…”) than a unified creative statement. Still, the album’s modes of expression—complex, finessed, helplessly earnest—come through with such force they may as well have been applied by firehose. Smashing Pumpkins got it, and Arcade Fire too, not to mention Kanye, Drake and Nas, all of whom prominently sampled the band—artists and producers who balanced all-caps feelings with an attention to detail and pop legibility. In November 1985, the band released a documentary called <i>Scenes From the Big Chair</i>, alternating music videos with live performances and interview clips. At one point, the cameraperson addresses a photographer from the German teen magazine <i>Bravo</i>. “Who are you photographing today?” the cameraperson asks. The photographer struggles to articulate the name, turning to Orzabal, standing in the background. “Tears for Fears,” the photographer says. “Is that right?” Orzabal shakes his head. “No,” he says. “We’re the Beatles”—a joke, of course, but evidence of the fences they were swinging for.

            "content": "Songs from the Big Chair is the second studio album by the British rock/pop band Tears for Fears, released on 25 February 1985 by Phonogram Records. The album peaked at number two in the UK and number one in the US and Canada. It spawned the international hit singles \"Mothers Talk\", \"Shout\", \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", \"Head over Heels\", and \"I Believe\". It remains their best-selling album to date.\n\nCurt Smith explains the album's title, March 1985:\n\"The title was my idea. It's a bit perverse but then you've got to understand our sense of humour. The 'Big Chair' idea is from this brilliant film called Sybil about a girl with 16 different personalities. She'd been tortured incredibly by her mother as a child and the only place she felt safe, the only time she could really be herself was when she was sitting in her analyst's chair. She felt safe, comfortable and wasn't using her different faces as a defence. It's kind of an 'up yours' to the English music press who really fucked us up for a while. This is us now – and they can't get at us anymore.\"\n\nThe album title was derived from the 1976 television film Sybil about a woman with multiple personality disorder who only feels safe when she is sitting in her analyst's \"big chair\". A mostly-instrumental track called \"The Big Chair\" (which includes dialogue samples from the film) was released as the B-side of \"Shout\" in 1984, but was not included on the album.\n\nThe album peaked at no.2 in the UK Albums Chart and remained in the Top 10 for over six months. In the US, it reached number one for five weeks (non-consecutive), and in Canada it reached number one for nine weeks (non-consecutive) and spent six months in the Top 3. In all three countries, the album went multi-platinum. It also reached number one in Germany and The Netherlands and Top 10 positions in various other countries including Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Italy.\n\nA companion video documentary entitled Scenes from the Big Chair was released in late 1985. Once the band had finished a lengthy touring and promotion schedule for the album, they took an extended hiatus from the music industry. In 1989, their third album, The Seeds of Love, marked their return.\n\nIn his review of Songs from the Big Chair, Barry McIlheney of Melody Maker stated that \"none of you should really be too surprised that Tears for Fears have made such an excellent album\", calling it \"an album that fully justifies the rather sneering, told-you-so looks adopted by Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal on the sleeve\", before concluding, \"An awful lot of people will, of course, go on and on about overcoats, The Lotus Eaters and an alleged lack of depth. And an awful lot of people will have to eat an awful lot of words.\" Ian Cranna of Smash Hits described it as \"looser, more exploratory than before\" in nature, and noted its \"unflinching lyrical honesty\". Rolling Stone critic Don Shewey wrote that Tears for Fears \"sounds a lot like a lot of other British bands\" and observed traces of \"U2's social conscience, the Bunnymen's echoing guitars and XTC's contorted pop wit\" on the album, but commented that Chris Hughes' production \"nudges Songs from the Big Chair slightly ahead of the pack.\" Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his review for The Village Voice, observing some substantial lyrics, particularly on \"The Working Hour\", and musical elements such as an \"uncommon command of guitar and piano, Baker Street sax, synthesizers more jagged than is deemed mete by the arbiters of dance-pop accessibility\". However, he felt these are all beneath grandiloquent lamentations suggesting \"a depth and drama English lads have been falling short on since the dawn of progressive rock.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review published on AllMusic, Stanton Swihart wrote: \"In the loping, percolating 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World', Tears for Fears perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the mid-'80s while impossibly managing to also create a dreamy, timeless pop classic. Songs from the Big Chair is one of the finest statements of the decade.\" Mark Elliott of Record Collector agreed, while adding that it contained the band's \"most consistently interesting material\". Q remarked that the album \"zeroed in on every angsty adolescent's desire to feel heroic, with a sound of spotlit, spacious sophistication plus anthemic choruses you'd bet your house on.\" In Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger concluded that \"even today, when all rock musicians seem to be able to do is be emotional and honest, the brutality and power of Songs from the Big Chair's catharsis is still quite shocking.\" Songs from the Big Chair has been included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Slant Magazine listed the album at number 95 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s.\n\nIn 1998, MFSL remastered and re-issued the album with an extended \"Head over Heels\" (running 5:24) and two bonus tracks (extended mixes of \"Shout\" and \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\").\n\nThe album was remastered and re-issued on CD in 1999 with bonus tracks, including B-sides and remixes. The track listing is based on the Special Edition cassette version of the album, which featured five B-sides as bonus tracks—including three tracks (\"The Conflict\", \"The Marauders\" and \"Broken Revisited\") from The Hurting period. In addition to these tracks, it includes two remixes.\n\nThe album was re-released again in a deluxe edition 2-disc format in 2006 with the full collection of B-sides and many alternate versions and remixes of the album's tracks.\n\nIn 2014, the album was released by Universal Music Japan on SHM-SACD.\n\nTo mark the album's 30th anniversary, Universal Music released the album in five different formats on 10 November 2014, including a 6-disc Super Deluxe Edition which includes four CDs and two DVDs (1 audio, 1 video). This edition also includes a 30-page replica 1985 tour programme and a 32-page booklet. Additional formats released simultaneously include another 2-disc Deluxe Edition, a single disc remastered edition, a 180-gram heavyweight vinyl album, and a \"Pure Audio\" Blu-Ray edition. The 5.1 surround sound mix is done by renowned remixer and progressive rock musician Steven Wilson.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tears+for+Fears/Songs+from+the+Big+Chair\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
