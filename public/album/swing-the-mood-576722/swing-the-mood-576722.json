      "biography": "Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers were a 1980s and early 1990s novelty pop music act from Rotherham, Yorkshire, England. The face of the group was Jive Bunny, a cartoon rabbit who appeared in the videos, and also (as a human being in a costume) did promotional appearances for them. Doncaster DJ and producer Les Hemstock created the original Swing the mood mix for the Music Factory owned Mastermix Dj service. It was then taken from there and developed as a single release by father and son team John and Andrew Pickles. The name Jive Bunny came from a nickname Andy Pickles used to call a friend. Ian Morgan a fellow DJ and co-producer also engineered and mixed some of the early releases along with Andy Pickles. Morgan was replaced in the early 1990s by DJ and producer Mark \"The Hitman\" Smith.\n\nJive Bunny's three number ones were \"Swing the Mood\", \"That's What I Like\" and \"Let's Party\". All three songs used sampling and synthesisers to combine pop music from the early rock and roll era together into a medley. The results were similar to Jaap Eggermont's Stars on 45 from the late 1970s and early 1980s, although he had hired \"sound-alike\" singers and musicians to recreate the music from scratch. Also similar was Mirage, active from the mid to late 1980s. Jive Bunny, Mirage and other similar concepts probably helped to establish the 'mash ups' phenomenon in which two or more songs are combined to create a new composition.",
