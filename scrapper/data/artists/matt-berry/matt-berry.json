  "biography": "Matt Berry (born 1974 in Bromham, Bedfordshire) is a British actor, writer and musician known for his deep, booming voice and a grand, rather roguish but charming manner. When not creating numerous indelible characters on a variety of British and American TV shows, multi-instrumentalist Matt Berry spends his time re-creating the sounds of the obscure albums he collects on songs that blend gentle British folk, wistful psychedelia, and rambling prog rock. Teaming with the venerable Acid Jazz label, Berry released a series of albums that explored pastoral folk-rock (2013's Kill the Wolf), new age synthesizer music (2014's Music for Insomniacs), country-rock (2020's Phantom Birds), and spot-on psychedelia (2021's Blue Elephant.) No matter the stylistic route he chooses, Berry plays it straight, and his surprisingly tender vocals, skills at a variety of instruments, and knack for a hook make it clear that he's not just an actor dabbling in music as a hobby. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Matt+Berry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His most famous song is Take My Hand, as used in Snuff Box during the Elton John sketch, and in Toast Of London as the main theme.
