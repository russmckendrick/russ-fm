      "biography": "The Police were an English rock band formed in London in 1977. For the majority of their history, the band consisted of Sting (lead singer, bassist and principal songwriter), Andy Summers (guitarist) and Stewart Copeland (drummer). The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and are generally regarded as one of the first new wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock that was influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. They are also considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S. They disbanded in 1986, but reunited in early 2007 for a one-off world tour that ended in August 2008.\nTheir 1978 debut album, Outlandos d'Amour, reached No. 6 in the UK, and their second album Reggatta de Blanc became the first of five consecutive UK No. 1 albums. Synchronicity from 1983 was No. 1 in both the UK and U.S., selling over 8 million copies in the U.S. alone. The Police have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, thanks to their reunion tour.\nThe band has won a number of music awards throughout their career, including six Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards—winning Best British Group once, an MTV Video Music Award, and in 2003 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their five studio albums appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The Police were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.",

      "editorial_notes": "In hindsight, it’s clear that 1980’s <i>Zenyatta Mondatta</i> was a sonic inflection point for The Police, an album that was a bridge between their days as a taut punk- and reggae-influenced band and their later, more adventurous tendencies. This was evident from the very first song on the album, “Don’t Stand So Close to Me”.\n\nThe tune starts with an ominous droning keyboard, incorporates dramatic dynamics and boasts a guitar synthesiser in the bridge played by Andy Summers. “Don’t Stand So Close to Me”, which later won a Grammy and reached No. 1 in the UK, also featured one of vocalist-bassist Sting’s most striking protagonists to date: a teacher full of guilt and shame for being in love with a student, much like the lead character in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel <i>Lolita</i>.\n\nAs with other Police albums, however, <i>Zenyatta Mondatta</i> was sonically eclectic, wrapping in a mix of instrumentals (“The Other Way of Stopping”) with quirky New Wave pop (“Canary in a Coalmine”, a clever song about someone living an anxious life) and reggae-influenced rock (“De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da”) with a dash of jazzy panache courtesy of drummer Stewart Copeland (“When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best of What’s Still Around”). The band’s weirdness was also present and accounted for; the instrumental “Behind My Camel” is as ominous as a horror movie interstitial, while “Shadows in the Rain” is murky dub.\n\nNigel Gray, who had recorded and engineered the band’s first two albums, 1978’s <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> and 1979’s <i>Reggatta de Blanc</i>, once again co-produced. That he knew the band so well was a boon: He pushed The Police to tease out their strengths—a dialled-in rhythm section, spring-loaded guitar riffs, Sting’s dynamic pop yelp—and refine these unique tendencies into a more cohesive, sophisticated album. <i>Zenyatta Mondatta</i> once again reached No. 1 in the UK and became the band’s first US Top 10 album, foreshadowing even greater things to come as the 1980s got rolling.",

            "content": "Zenyattà Mondatta is the third album by The Police, released in 1980.\n\nWritten during the band's second tour and recorded in just four weeks (minus several days for a short tour of the Netherlands). The band members have often expressed disappointment over it, going so far as to re-record two songs during a brief, unsuccessful reunion. Drummer Stewart Copeland, who contributed the songs \"Bombs Away\" and \"The Other Way of Stopping\", said about the time pressures:\n“ \tWe had bitten off more than we could chew. We finished the album at 4 a.m. on the day we were starting our next world tour... It was cutting it very fine. \t”\n\nNevertheless, Zenyattà Mondatta went to #5 in the U.S. and #1 in the UK and Australia, spurred by the success of the Sting-penned singles \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" and \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\". It would later receive glowing reviews from re-assessments in Rolling Stone and Q Magazine, among others, in spite of the fact that this is the least well-received of the five albums by The Police - so much so, it was the only of their five albums not to obtain a spot on the Rolling Stone's list 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAs alluded to by Copeland, the Police embarked on a tour of the world the day of the album's completion, beginning in Belgium and reaching places such as India and Egypt.\n\nThe album itself is the last of the Police's early era, influenced by reggae and punk and featuring few musical elements on top of the core guitar, bass, and drums. Perhaps due to the lack of time for writing lyrics, the record has two instrumentals, \"The Other Way of Stopping\", and the Grammy-winning \"Behind My Camel\" (a third song, \"Voices Inside My Head\", is mostly an instrumental except for the words \"Voices inside my head/ Echoes of things that you said\", which are repeated a couple of times in the middle of the song). \"Behind My Camel\" was guitarist Andy Summers' first entirely self-penned composition, and it was not popular with the other members of the band. According to Sting, \"I hated that song so much that, one day when I was in the studio, I found the tape lying on the table. So I took it around the back of the studio and actually buried it in the garden.\" Allegedly, Sting was so uninterested in the piece that he refused to play it. Andy Summers managed to coax Stewart Copeland into recording the bit as a duo, and then overdubbed the bass line himself.\n\nZenyattà Mondatta is also notable for containing the band's first lyrics ever referring to political events, with Sting's \"Driven To Tears\" commenting on poverty and Copeland's \"Bombs Away\" referring to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. These themes would become more prevalent in the Police's next album, Ghost in the Machine.\n\nZenyattà Mondatta has been translated as Sanskrit for \"Top of the World\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Zenyatta+Mondatta\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
