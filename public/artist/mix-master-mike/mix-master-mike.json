  "biography": "Mix Master Mike (born April 4, 1970) is an American turntablist of Jewish and Filipino extraction. His real name is Michael Schwartz. He was born in Daly City, California.\n\nHe first gained notoriety after performing at several live DJ competitions. Mix Master Mike later joined the ground-breaking turntablist group, Invisibl Skratch Piklz. After gaining fame, he hooked up with the Beastie Boys, working on the album Hello Nasty. He is now considered their resident DJ, replacing DJ Hurricane (who was preceded by Doctor Dre - not to be confused with Dr. Dre).\n\nIn 1994, after winning three consecutive world titles of the international DMC turntablism award. Mike and Q-Bert were asked to step down from further competition as their domination was too much for the rest of the pack. The two performed an amazing \"farewell\" set and were honored to become DMC judges. Mike has also helped fellow DJs produce their own albums, most notably, Wave Twisters, by DJ Q-bert. Mix Master Mike is known for his heavy-hitting bass and intricate scratch routines.\n\nMix Master Mike is often credited with inventing the Tweak Scratch. The scratch is performed by moving the record back and forth while the platter is stopped. The inertia of the platter causes the sounds to slow down and drop in pitch in an unusual manner. This claim is backed up somewhat by a recording of a voicemail he left the Beastie Boys on the track \"Three MC's and one DJ\". In it he states that he's hooked his turntable up to a wah-wah pedal.\n\nMix Master Mike got the idea for his wild music when one night practising he saw 3 lights land on a football field outside of his home. He thought the lights were from another universe and believed that he could communicate with aliens.\n\nHe is quoted as saying that when he makes an album he tries to make it so that when people listen to it in the year 3000 they'll say, \"Yo, this is crazy.\"\n\nIn addition to his solo work, Mix Master Mike is the Beastie Boys DJ. Beyond helping the rock/rap/punk trio create sounds for new albums he uses his turntablism expertise to bring a new dimimension to their live shows, freshening up decades old songs by dropping cuts, beats, and samples from a wide range of artists and styles,\n\n\nAlbums\n\n    * Anti-Theft Device (1998)\n    * Spin Psycle (2001)\n    * Bangzilla (2004)\n\n\n\nEPs and singles\n\n    * Mixmasterpiece: Muzik's Worst Nightmare (1996)\n    * Surprize Packidge (1999)\n    * Eye of the Cyklops (2000)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mix+Master+Mike\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "profile": "One of the premier scratch artists of the day, Mix Master Mike got his initial itch for vinyl while growing up in San Francisco listening to his uncle's extensive record collection, the sounds of which would regularly welcome him home after school.  Years later, the moment that had the most impact on him was catching [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/D.St.]Grandmixer D. ST.[/url] on stage with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Herbie+Hancock]Herbie Hancock[/url].\r\n\r\nWith his newfound love of hip-hop and his foray into scratching, Mike got involved in the mobile DJ business playing house parties, weddings and all those other \"cutting the chops\" types of gigs, some for experience and the exposure. It was at one of those parties that he met Richard Quitevis, better known as [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Q-Bert]DJ Q-Bert[/url]. Q-Bert wasn't a DJ at the time, but was so impressed with Mike's scratching technique that it had the same effect on him as watching Grandmixer D. ST. had for Mike. The following day, Richard went over to Mike's to watch him practice and it was there that the two quickly became friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Mike was the first West Coast DJ to become World Champion by winning the New Music Seminar DJ Battle for World Supremacy in New York City. That same year, Mike, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Apollo+(2)]DJ Apollo[/url] and Q-Bert known as the first ever scratch band won the DMC World title. In 1993, Mike and Q-Bert decided to take the competition to the next level by teaming up as a scratch duo known as \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dream+Team,+The+(2)]The Dream Team[/url]\" and won the title once again.

Years later, the moment that had the most impact on him was catching [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/D.St.]Grandmixer D. ST.[/url] on stage with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Herbie+Hancock]Herbie Hancock[/url].\r\n\r\nWith his newfound love of hip-hop and his foray into scratching, Mike got involved in the mobile DJ business playing house parties, weddings and all those other \"cutting the chops\" types of gigs, some for experience and the exposure. It was at one of those parties that he met Richard Quitevis, better known as [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Q-Bert]DJ Q-Bert[/url]. Q-Bert wasn't a DJ at the time, but was so impressed with Mike's scratching technique that it had the same effect on him as watching Grandmixer D. ST. had for Mike. The following day, Richard went over to Mike's to watch him practice and it was there that the two quickly became friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Mike was the first West Coast DJ to become World Champion by winning the New Music Seminar DJ Battle for World Supremacy in New York City.

In 1993, Mike and Q-Bert decided to take the competition to the next level by teaming up as a scratch duo known as \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dream+Team,+The+(2)]The Dream Team[/url]\" and won the title once again.

Mix Master Mike is known for his heavy-hitting bass and intricate scratch routines.\\n\\nMix Master Mike is often credited with inventing the Tweak Scratch. The scratch is performed by moving the record back and forth while the platter is stopped. The inertia of the platter causes the sounds to slow down and drop in pitch in an unusual manner. This claim is backed up somewhat by a recording of a voicemail he left the Beastie Boys on the track \"Three MC\\'s and one DJ\". In it he states that he\\'s hooked his turntable up to a wah-wah pedal.\\n\\nMix Master Mike got the idea for his wild music when one night practising he saw 3 lights land on a football field outside of his home. He thought the lights were from another universe and believed that he could communicate with aliens.\\n\\nHe is quoted as saying that when he makes an album he tries to make it so that when people listen to it in the year 3000 they\\'ll say, \"Yo, this is crazy.\"\\n\\nIn addition to his solo work, Mix Master Mike is the Beastie Boys DJ.

His real name is Michael Schwartz. He was born in Daly City, California.\\n\\nHe first gained notoriety after performing at several live DJ competitions. Mix Master Mike later joined the ground-breaking turntablist group, Invisibl Skratch Piklz. After gaining fame, he hooked up with the Beastie Boys, working on the album Hello Nasty. He is now considered their resident DJ, replacing DJ Hurricane (who was preceded by Doctor Dre - not to be confused with Dr. Dre).\\n\\nIn 1994, after winning three consecutive world titles of the international DMC turntablism award. Mike and Q-Bert were asked to step down from further competition as their domination was too much for the rest of the pack. The two performed an amazing \"farewell\" set and were honored to become DMC judges. Mike has also helped fellow DJs produce their own albums, most notably, Wave Twisters, by DJ Q-bert. Mix Master Mike is known for his heavy-hitting bass and intricate scratch routines.\\n\\nMix Master Mike is often credited with inventing the Tweak Scratch. The scratch is performed by moving the record back and forth while the platter is stopped. The inertia of the platter causes the sounds to slow down and drop in pitch in an unusual manner. This claim is backed up somewhat by a recording of a voicemail he left the Beastie Boys on the track \"Three MC\\'s and one DJ\". In it he states that he\\'s hooked his turntable up to a wah-wah pedal.\\n\\nMix Master Mike got the idea for his wild music when one night practising he saw 3 lights land on a football field outside of his home. He thought the lights were from another universe and believed that he could communicate with aliens.\\n\\nHe is quoted as saying that when he makes an album he tries to make it so that when people listen to it in the year 3000 they\\'ll say, \"Yo, this is crazy.\"\\n\\nIn addition to his solo work, Mix Master Mike is the Beastie Boys DJ. Beyond helping the rock/rap/punk trio create sounds for new albums he uses his turntablism expertise to bring a new dimimension to their live shows, freshening up decades old songs by dropping cuts, beats, and samples from a wide range of artists and styles,\\n\\n\\nAlbums\\n\\n    * Anti-Theft Device (1998)\\n    * Spin Psycle (2001)\\n    * Bangzilla (2004)\\n\\n\\n\\nEPs and singles\\n\\n    * Mixmasterpiece: Muzik\\'s Worst Nightmare (1996)\\n    * Surprize Packidge (1999)\\n    * Eye of the Cyklops (2000)\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mix+Master+Mike\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was at one of those parties that he met Richard Quitevis, better known as [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Q-Bert]DJ Q-Bert[/url]. Q-Bert wasn't a DJ at the time, but was so impressed with Mike's scratching technique that it had the same effect on him as watching Grandmixer D. ST. had for Mike.

In 1994, after winning three consecutive world titles and consistently coming out on top, Mike and Q-Bert were asked to step down from further competition as their domination was too much for the rest of the pack.

      "bio_content": "Mix Master Mike (born April 4, 1970) is an American turntablist of Jewish and Filipino extraction. His real name is Michael Schwartz. He was born in Daly City, California.\n\nHe first gained notoriety after performing at several live DJ competitions. Mix Master Mike later joined the ground-breaking turntablist group, Invisibl Skratch Piklz. After gaining fame, he hooked up with the Beastie Boys, working on the album Hello Nasty. He is now considered their resident DJ, replacing DJ Hurricane (who was preceded by Doctor Dre - not to be confused with Dr. Dre).\n\nIn 1994, after winning three consecutive world titles of the international DMC turntablism award. Mike and Q-Bert were asked to step down from further competition as their domination was too much for the rest of the pack. The two performed an amazing \"farewell\" set and were honored to become DMC judges. Mike has also helped fellow DJs produce their own albums, most notably, Wave Twisters, by DJ Q-bert. Mix Master Mike is known for his heavy-hitting bass and intricate scratch routines.\n\nMix Master Mike is often credited with inventing the Tweak Scratch. The scratch is performed by moving the record back and forth while the platter is stopped. The inertia of the platter causes the sounds to slow down and drop in pitch in an unusual manner. This claim is backed up somewhat by a recording of a voicemail he left the Beastie Boys on the track \"Three MC's and one DJ\". In it he states that he's hooked his turntable up to a wah-wah pedal.\n\nMix Master Mike got the idea for his wild music when one night practising he saw 3 lights land on a football field outside of his home. He thought the lights were from another universe and believed that he could communicate with aliens.\n\nHe is quoted as saying that when he makes an album he tries to make it so that when people listen to it in the year 3000 they'll say, \"Yo, this is crazy.\"\n\nIn addition to his solo work, Mix Master Mike is the Beastie Boys DJ. Beyond helping the rock/rap/punk trio create sounds for new albums he uses his turntablism expertise to bring a new dimimension to their live shows, freshening up decades old songs by dropping cuts, beats, and samples from a wide range of artists and styles,\n\n\nAlbums\n\n    * Anti-Theft Device (1998)\n    * Spin Psycle (2001)\n    * Bangzilla (2004)\n\n\n\nEPs and singles\n\n    * Mixmasterpiece: Muzik's Worst Nightmare (1996)\n    * Surprize Packidge (1999)\n    * Eye of the Cyklops (2000)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mix+Master+Mike\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
