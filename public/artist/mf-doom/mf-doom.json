  "biography": "Daniel Dumile (July 13, 1971 – October 31, 2020) was a British-American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He performed and released music under a variety of stage names, most notably MF DOOM, which Dumile preferred to be stylized in all caps. Dumile debuted during hip-hop's golden age of the late 1980s and became a major figure in underground hip-hop of the early 21st century. He is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Being dubbed as \"Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper\".\n\nBorn in London, Dumile moved with his family to Long Island, New York, at a young age. He began his musical career in 1988 as a member of the East Coast hip-hop trio KMD, performing under the name Zev Love X. KMD disbanded in 1993 following the death of Dumile's brother, DJ Subroc. After a hiatus from the music scene, Dumile reemerged in 1998, performing at open mic events while wearing a mask. He adopted the MF DOOM persona and rarely appeared unmasked in public thereafter. His iconic metal mask resembled that of Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom, who is depicted rapping on the cover of his 1999 debut solo album Operation: Doomsday. In the early 2000s, Dumile also released solo albums under the pseudonyms King Geedorah and Viktor Vaughn.\n\nMF DOOM appeared in several collaborative projects, including Madvillain (with Madlib), DANGERDOOM (with Danger Mouse), DOOMSTARKS (with Ghostface Killah), JJ DOOM (with Jneiro Jarel), NEHRUVIANDOOM (with Bishop Nehru), and Czarface Meets Metal Face (with CZARFACE).\n\nDumile was born to a Trinidadian mother and a Zimbabwean father. His family moved to Long Island, New York, during his childhood, but he retained British citizenship throughout his life. Dumile grew up in Freeport, New York, and began DJ'ing in elementary school. After relocating to London in 2009, he continued to release music while living abroad. Dumile was a follower of the Nuwaubian Nation and often incorporated esoteric themes into his work.\n\nDumile created the MF DOOM persona as an alter ego with a detailed backstory, blending elements from Doctor Doom, Destro, and the Phantom of the Opera. His signature mask, inspired by Doctor Doom and later adapted from a prop in Gladiator, became a defining feature of his public image. Dumile’s character-driven approach to music allowed him to critique the music industry and explore themes of identity, alienation, and power.\n\nKnown for his intricate wordplay, free-association rhyme schemes, and unconventional production style, MF DOOM influenced countless contemporary artists. His music drew inspiration from cartoons, comic books, and other realms of pop culture, cementing his reputation as a boundary-pushing artist.\n\nFollowing Dumile's death, announced by his wife Jasmine on December 31, 2020, tributes poured in from fans and fellow artists alike. He was celebrated as a genius of lyricism and one of hip-hop's most enigmatic figures. Artists such as Thom Yorke, El-P, and Q-Tip acknowledged his profound influence, describing him as a transformative figure in the music world.\n\nDumile's legacy continues to thrive. His albums, particularly Madvillainy and Operation: Doomsday, are regarded as classics that resonate with new generations of listeners. Documentaries, retrospectives, and scholarly works further explore his impact, solidifying MF DOOM’s place as a cornerstone of hip-hop history. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
