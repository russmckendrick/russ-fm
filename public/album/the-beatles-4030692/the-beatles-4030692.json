      "biography": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, becoming one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon (rhythm guitar/vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar/vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar/vocals), and Ringo Starr (drums/vocals). Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the group later utilised many genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements, in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\nAs a five-piece line-up of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison on guitar and vocals, with Stuart Sutcliffe (bass), and Pete Best (drums), the band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Sutcliffe left the group in 1961, and Best was replaced by Starr the following year. They were moulded into a professional act by manager Brian Epstein, and their musical potential was enhanced by the creativity of producer George Martin. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first single, \"Love Me Do\", became a modest hit in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. The band toured extensively around the world until August 1966, when they performed their final commercial concert. From 1966 they produced what many critics consider to be some of their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, the ex-Beatles each found success in individual musical careers. Lennon was murdered in 1980, and Harrison died of cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain active.\nThe Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with sales of over one billion units estimated by EMI Records. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 they have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist, and in 2008 they topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.",

The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes “The White Album” so surprising.

The cacophony of “Revolution 9” is followed by the orchestral lullaby of “Good Night”. The album’s extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio. ",

            "content": "The Beatles is the ninth official British album and the fifteenth American album by The Beatles, a double album released in 1968. It is commonly known as The White Album as it has no graphics or text other than the band’s name (and, on the early LP and CD releases, a serial number) on its plain white sleeve. The album was the first the Beatles undertook following the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, and the first released by their own record label, Apple. Originally entitled A Doll’s House, the title was changed when the British progressive rock band Family released the similarly titled Music in a Doll’s House earlier that year.\n\nThe Beatles was written and recorded during a period of turmoil for the group. After visiting the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India and having a particularly productive songwriting session in early 1968, the group returned to the studio for recording from May to October 1968, only to have conflict and dissent drive the group members apart. Drummer Ringo Starr quit the band for a brief time, leaving bassist Paul McCartney to perform drums on some of the album’s songs.\n\nUpon release in November 1968, the album received mixed to positive reviews and reached the number one spot on the charts in the United Kingdom and United States. The album is notable for the eclectic nature of its songs, which has divided critics in evaluating the album’s legacy. Still, The Beatles is regarded as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In 2003, the album was ranked number 10 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of “The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time”.\n\nMost of the songs were conceived during a transcendental meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India in the spring of 1968. Although the retreat, which had required long periods of meditation, was initially conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours—a chance, in John Lennon’s words, to “get away from everything”— both Lennon and Paul McCartney had quickly found themselves in songwriting mode, often meeting “clandestinely in the afternoons in each other’s rooms” to review the new work. “Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,” Lennon would later recall, “I did write some of my best songs there.” Close to forty new compositions had emerged in Rishikesh, twenty-three of which would be laid down in very rough form at Kinfauns, George Harrison’s home in Esher, in May of 1968.\n\nThe Beatles had left Rishikesh before the end of the course, with Ringo Starr and then McCartney departing first, and Lennon and Harrison departing together later. According to some reports, Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed by rumours that Maharishi had made sexual advances toward Mia Farrow, who had accompanied The Beatles on their trip. Shortly after he decided to leave, Lennon wrote a song called “Maharishi” which included the lyrics, “Maharishi/You little twat”; the song became “Sexy Sadie”. According to several authors, Alexis Mardas (aka “Magic Alex”) deliberately engineered these rumours because he was bent on undermining the Maharishi’s influence over each Beatle. In a 1980 interview, Lennon acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song: “I just called him ‘Sexy Sadie’.\n\nThe Beatles was recorded between 30 May 1968 and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios, with some sessions at Trident Studios. Although productive, the sessions were reportedly undisciplined and sometimes fractious, and they took place at a time when tensions were growing within the group. Concurrent with the recording of this album, The Beatles were launching their new multimedia business corporation Apple Corps, an enterprise that proved to be a source of significant stress for the band.\n\nThe sessions for The Beatles marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon’s new girlfriend and artistic partner, Yoko Ono, who would thereafter be a more or less constant presence at all Beatles sessions. Prior to Ono’s appearance on the scene, the individual Beatles had been very insular during recording sessions, with influence from outsiders strictly limited. McCartney’s girlfriend at the time, Francie Schwartz, was also present at some of the recording sessions.\n\nAuthor Mark Lewisohn reports that The Beatles held their first and only 24-hour recording/producing session near the end of the creation of The Beatles, which occurred during the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney, and producer George Martin.\n\nDespite the album’s official title, which emphasised group identity, studio efforts on The Beatles captured the work of four increasingly individualised artists who frequently found themselves at odds. The band’s work pattern changed dramatically with this project, and by most accounts the extraordinary synergy of The Beatles’ previous studio sessions was harder to come by during this period. Sometimes McCartney would record in one studio for prolonged periods of time, while Lennon would record in another, each man using different engineers. At one point in the sessions, George Martin, whose authority over the band in the studio had waned, spontaneously left to go on holiday, leaving Chris Thomas in charge of producing. During one of these sessions, while recording “Helter Skelter”, Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head.\n\nLong after the recording of The Beatles was complete, Martin mentioned in interviews that his working relationship with The Beatles changed during this period, and that many of the band’s efforts seemed unfocused, often yielding prolonged jam sessions that sounded uninspired. On 16 July recording engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with the group since Revolver, announced he was no longer willing to work with the group.\n\nThe sudden departures were not limited to EMI personnel. On 22 August, Starr abruptly left the studio, explaining later that he felt his role was minimised compared to that of the other members, and that he was tired of waiting through the long and contentious recording sessions. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison pleaded with Starr to return, and after two weeks he did. Upon Starr’s return, he found his drum kit decorated with red, white and blue flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison. The reconciliation was, however, only temporary, and Starr’s exit served as a precursor of future “months and years of misery”, in Starr’s words. Indeed, after The Beatles was completed, both Harrison and Lennon would stage similar unpublicised departures from the band. McCartney, whose public departure in 1970 would mark the formal end of the band’s ensemble, described the sessions for The Beatles as a turning point for the group. Up to this point, he observed, “The world was a problem, but we weren’t. You know, that was the best thing about The Beatles, until we started to break up, like during the White Album and stuff. Even the studio got a bit tense then.”\n\nAccording to Lewisohn, McCartney played drums on “Back in the U.S.S.R.” because Starr had left the group during the period when the song was being recorded. Lewisohn also reports that, in the case of “Dear Prudence”, also recorded during Starr’s absence, the three remaining Beatles each made contributions on bass and drums, with the result that those parts may be composite tracks played by Lennon, McCartney and/or Harrison. As of 2010, the actual musician/instrument lineup on the track remains disputed.\n\nThough not formally credited on the album, Eric Clapton played lead guitar on Harrison’s “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”. Harrison explains in The Beatles Anthology that Clapton’s presence temporarily alleviated the studio tension and that all band members were on their best behaviour during his time with the band in the studio. Harrison, who had invited Clapton to the sessions, soon reciprocated by collaborating with Clapton on the song “Badge” for Cream’s last album Goodbye.\n\nClapton was not the only outside musician to sit in on the sessions. Nicky Hopkins provided electric piano for the single cut of “Revolution” (recorded during these sessions); Hopkins also provided acoustic piano on a number of tracks. Several horns were also recorded on the album version of “Revolution 1”. “Savoy Truffle” also features the horn section. Jack Fallon played a bluegrass fiddle on “Don’t Pass Me By”, and a team of orchestral players and background singers appeared on “Good Night” (which was Beatle-free except for Ringo’s vocal).\n\nThe sessions for The Beatles were notable for the band’s formal transition from 4-track to 8-track recording. As work on the album began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting in a storage room for months. This was in accordance with EMI’s policy of testing and customizing new gear, sometimes for months, before putting it into use in the studios. The Beatles recorded “Hey Jude” and “Dear Prudence” at Trident Studios in central London, which had an 8-track recorder. When they learned about EMI’s 8-track recorder, they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries took the machine (without authorization from the studio chiefs) into the Number 2 recording studio at Abbey Road for the band’s use.\n\nSongs\n\nAlthough most of the songs on any given Beatles album are usually credited to the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team, that description is often misleading, and rarely more so than on The Beatles. With this album, each of the four band members began to showcase the range and depth of his individual songwriting talents, and to display styles that would be carried over to his eventual solo career. Indeed, some songs that the individual Beatles were working on during this period eventually were released on solo albums. These include Lennon’s “Look at Me” and “Child of Nature”, eventually reworked as “Jealous Guy”; McCartney’s “Junk” and “Teddy Boy”; and Harrison’s “Not Guilty” and “Circles”.\n\nMany of the songs on the album display experimentation with unlikely musical genres, borrowing directly from such sources as 1930s dance-hall music (in “Honey Pie”), classical chamber music (in “Piggies”), the avant-garde sensibilities of Yoko Ono and John Cage (in “Revolution 9”), and the lush sentimentality of Henry Mancini’s film scores (in “Good Night”). Such diversity was quite unprecedented in global pop music in 1968, and the album’s sprawling approach provoked (and continues to provoke) both praise and criticism from observers. “Revolution 9”, in particular, a densely layered eight-minute-and-thirteen-second sound collage, has attracted both interest and disapproval from both fans and music critics over the years.\n\nThe only western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the acoustic guitar, and thus most of the songs on The Beatles were written and first performed on that instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles (notably “Rocky Raccoon”, “Blackbird”, “Julia”, “Cry Baby Cry”, “I Will” and “Mother Nature’s Son”) and were recorded in the studio either solo, or by only part of the group.\n\nA number of songs were recorded during these sessions but were never included on a Beatles record, including Harrison’s “Not Guilty” (which he rerecorded for his 1979 self-titled album, George Harrison), Lennon’s “What’s the New Mary Jane” (which has been previously recorded), and McCartney’s “Jubilee” (later retitled “Junk” and released on McCartney’s first solo LP).\n\nOthers included “Mean Mr. Mustard” and “Polythene Pam” (both of which would be used for the medley on Abbey Road); “Child of Nature” (recorded with drastically different lyrics as “Jealous Guy” for Lennon’s Imagine); “Etcetera” (a McCartney composition later recorded by the Black Dyke Mills Band as “Thingumybob”); “The Long and Winding Road” (completed in 1969 for the Let It Be LP); “Something” (which ended up on Abbey Road); and “Sour Milk Sea” (which Harrison gave to friend and Apple artist Jackie Lomax for his first LP, Is This What You Want).\n\nOther songs recorded for, but ultimately left off The Beatles received significant exposure via bootlegs, notably Harrison’s “Circles” (which he would eventually re-record as solo tracks and release on his 1982 album, Gone Troppo) and “Not Guilty”, and Lennon’s manic “What’s the New Mary Jane”. More recently, the song “Revolution 1 (Take 20)”, a previously unknown track, surfaced in 2009 on the Europe-only bootleg Revolution: Take…Your Knickers Off and is supposed to connect “Revolution 1” and the avant-garde “Revolution 9” (both of which appeared on The Beatles) in an attempt by Lennon to record one long version of “Revolution” before ultimately splitting the two songs up.\n\nThe Beatles was the first Beatles’ album released by Apple Records, as well as their only original double album. Producer George Martin has said that he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs in order to form a single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band decided against this. Interviewed for the Beatles Anthology, Starr said he now felt it should have been released as two separate albums (that he appropriately named The White Album and The Whiter Album). Harrison felt on reflection that some of the tracks could have been released as B-sides, but “there was a lot of ego in that band”. He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs the group had at the time. McCartney, by contrast, said it was fine as it was and that its wide variety of songs was a major part of the album’s appeal.\n\nThe Beatles shares the same release date (22 November) as The Beatles’ second album, With the Beatles, released five years earlier.\n\nAlthough “Hey Jude” was not intended to be included on any LP release, it was recorded during the White Album sessions and was released as a stand-alone single before the release of The Beatles. “Hey Jude’s” B-side, “Revolution”, was an alternate version of the album’s “Revolution 1”. Lennon had wanted the original version of “Revolution” to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. A new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and a high-energy keyboard solo from Nicky Hopkins was recorded, and was relegated to the flip side of “Hey Jude”. The resulting release — “Hey Jude” on side A and “Revolution” on side B — emerged as the first release on the Beatles’ new Apple Records label. It went on to be the Beatles’ most successful single, with world sales over 5 million by the end of 1968 and 7.5 million by October 1972.\n\nFour tracks from the “White Album” were released on two American and one British single almost eight years after the original album was released. In the summer 1976, to promote the compilation album, Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, EMI’s Parlophone label in the UK and its Capitol label in the US each released a single that contained A and B-sides that appeared on the compilation album. In Britain, Parlophone issued “Back in the U.S.S.R.” as the single. (Its B-side was “Twist and Shout”, which originally appeared on the group’s first album, Please Please Me.) In America, Capitol released “Got to Get You Into My Life” (from the group’s 1966 album, Revolver) on the A-side, but selected “Helter Skelter,” to serve as the flip side. “Helter Skelter” was likely chosen for the B-side because a cover version of the song had been prominently featured in a made-for-TV movie about the Charles Manson murders that had aired on CBS shortly before the release of Rock ‘n’ Roll Music. The singles were successful, with “Got to Get You into My Life” hitting No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and “Back in the U.S.S.R.” hitting No. 18 on the New Musical Express chart in Britain. Both records also helped sell Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, which hit No. 2 in the United States and No. 10 in the UK. With the success of the singles from the compilation album, Capitol followed-up “Got To Get You Into My Life” with the release of another single in November 1976. Instead of taking two more tracks from Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, however, Capitol selected two “White Album” tracks—”Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” as the A-Side, and “Julia” as the B-Side. The “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” single was sold in an individually-numbered white picture sleeve that mimicked the design of the original album. “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, however, as it failed to make the Top Forty, stalling out at No. 49 on Billboard.\n\nThe Beatles was the last Beatles album to be released with a unique, alternate mono mix, albeit one issued only in the UK and a few other countries. Twenty-eight of the album’s 30 tracks (“Revolution 1” and “Revolution 9” being the only exceptions) exist in official alternate mono mixes. Several of these mono mixes are quite different from the stereo versions.\n\nBeatles’ albums after The Beatles (except Yellow Submarine in the UK) occasionally had mono pressings in certain countries (such as Brazil), but these editions—Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road and Let It Be—were in each case mono fold-downs from the regular stereo mixes.\n\nIn the US, mono records were already being phased out; the US release of The Beatles was the first Beatles LP to be issued in stereo only.\n\nThe mono version of The Beatles was made available worldwide (including the US) on 9 September 2009, as part of the Beatles in Mono CD box set.\n\nThe album’s sleeve was designed by Richard Hamilton, a notable pop artist who had organised a Marcel Duchamp retrospective at the Tate Gallery the previous year. Hamilton’s design was in stark contrast to Peter Blake’s vivid cover art for Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band’s name was discreetly embossed slightly below the middle of the album’s right side, and the cover also featured a unique stamped serial number, “to create,” in Hamilton’s words, “the ironic situation of a numbered edition of something like five million copies.” Indeed, the artist intended the cover to resemble the “look” of conceptual art, an emerging movement in contemporary art at the time. Later vinyl record releases in the US showed the title in grey printed (rather than embossed) letters. Early copies on compact disc were also numbered. Later CD releases rendered the album’s title in black or grey. The 30th anniversary CD release was done to look like the original album sleeve, with an embossed title and serial number, including a small reproduction of the poster and pictures (see re-issues).\n\nThe album’s inside packaging included a poster, the lyrics to the songs, and a set of photographs taken by John Kelly during the autumn of 1968 that have themselves become iconic. This is the only sleeve of a Beatles studio album not to show the members of the band on the front.\n\nTape versions of the album did not feature a white cover. Instead, cassette, reel-to-reel, and 8-track versions (first issued on two cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured high contrast black and white (with no grey) versions of the four Kelly photographs. In both the cassette and 8-track versions of the album, the two tapes were sold in a black slip-cover box that bore the title, “The Beatles” and the outline of an apple, embossed in silver. This departure from the LP’s design not only made it difficult for less-informed fans to identify the tape in record stores, but it also led some fans at the time to jokingly refer to the 8-track or cassette not as the “white album” but as the “black tape.” In 1988, Capitol/EMI re-issued the 2-cassette version of the album, still with the same cover artwork as the original cassettes, but without the black slip-cover box.\n\nThe Beatles were at the peak of their global influence and visibility in late 1968. Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, released the previous year, had enjoyed a combination of commercial success, critical acclaim, and immense cultural influence that had previously seemed inconceivable for a pop release. Time, for instance, had written in 1967 that Pepper constituted a “historic departure in the progress of music—any music,” while Timothy Leary, in a widely quoted assessment of the same period, declared that the band were prototypes of “evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with mysterious powers to create a new human species.” After releasing an album that had delivered such critical, commercial, and generational shockwaves, The Beatles faced the inevitable question of what they could possibly do to top it. The next full-length album, whatever it was, was destined to draw considerable scrutiny. The intervening release of Magical Mystery Tour notwithstanding (released as a double-EP package in the UK), The Beatles represented the group’s first major musical statement since Sgt. Pepper, and thus was a highly anticipated event for both the mainstream press and the youth-oriented counter-culture movement with which the band had by this time become strongly associated. Expectations, to say the least, were high.\n\nThe reviews were mixed to mostly positive.\n\n* Tony Palmer, in The Observer, wrote shortly after the album’s release: “If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the greatest songwriters since Schubert, then … the album The Beatles … should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making…”\n* Richard Goldstein, writing in The New York Times on 8 December 1968, described the album as a “major success.”\n* Another review in The New York Times, this one by Nik Cohn, considered the album “boring beyond belief” and described “more than half the songs” as “profound mediocrities.”\n* Alan Smith, in an NME review entitled “The Brilliant, the Bad, and the Ugly,” derided “Revolution #9” as a “pretentious” example of “idiot immaturity” and, in the following sentence, assigned the benediction “God Bless You, Beatles!” to “most of the rest” of the album.\n* The New Rolling Stone Album Guide praises the album but maintains that it has “loads of self-indulgent filler,” identifying “Revolution #9” in particular as “justly maligned,” and suggests that listeners in the CD era, who can program digital players to skip over unwanted tracks, may have an advantage over the album’s original audience.\n\nSome contemporary critics say the album’s inclusion of supposedly extraneous material is a part of its appeal. Stephen Thomas Erlewine’s review for Allmusic contends that:\n\n* “Each song on the sprawling double album The Beatles is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything they can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the White Album interesting is its mess.”\n\nOne important current trend in critical assessments of the album is to draw parallels between the band’s disintegrating ensemble and the chaotic events of the tumultuous year in which The Beatles was created, 1968. Along these lines, Slant Magazine observed that:\n\n* “(The album) reveals the popping seams of a band that had the pressure of an entire fissuring generational/political gap on its back. Maybe it’s because it shows The Beatles at the point where even their music couldn’t hide the underlying tensions between John, Paul, George, and Ringo, or maybe because it was (coincidentally?) released at the tail end of a year anyone could agree was the embittered honeymoon’s end for the Love Generation, the year when, to borrow from a famous Yeats poem, the center decidedly could not hold … for whatever reason, The Beatles is still one of the few albums by the Fab Four that resists reflexive canonization, which, along with society’s continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising.”\n\nIn 1997, The Beatles was named the 10th greatest album of all time in a ‘Music of the Millennium’ poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 17, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number seven in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\n\nIn 2001, the TV network VH1 named it as the 11th greatest album ever.\n\nIt was ranked number 10 in Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003.\n\nIn 2006, the album was chosen by Time Magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time.\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the album’s release the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, published a lengthy article which declared that “Forty years later, this album remains a type of magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled.” Forgiving Lennon’s “more popular than Jesus” remark, the paper called the White Album the “creative summit” of the Beatles’ career, comparing it favourably to contemporary music and taking note of the now antiquated equipment used, concluding that “a listening experience like that offered by the Beatles is truly rare.”\n\nIan MacDonald, in his book Revolution in the Head, argues that The Beatles was the album in which the band’s cryptic messages to its fan base became not merely vague but intentionally and perhaps dangerously open-ended, citing oblique passages in songs like “Glass Onion” (e.g., “the walrus was Paul”) and “Piggies” (“what they need’s a damn good whacking”). These pronouncements, and many others on the album, came to attract extraordinary popular interest at a time when more of the world’s youth were using drugs recreationally and looking for spiritual, political, and strategic advice from The Beatles. Steve Turner, too, in his book A Hard Day’s Write, maintains that, with this album, “The Beatles had perhaps laid themselves open to misinterpretation by mixing up the languages of poetry and nonsense.” Bob Dylan’s songs had been similarly mined for hidden meanings, but the massive countercultural analysis of The Beatles surpassed anything that had gone before.\n\nEven Lennon’s seemingly direct engagement with the tumultuous political issues of 1968 in “Revolution 1” carried a nuanced obliqueness, and ended up sending messages the author may not have intended. In the album’s version of the song, Lennon advises those who “talk about destruction” to “count me out.” As McDonald notes, however, Lennon then follows the sung word “out” with the spoken word “in.” At the time of the album’s release — which followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, “Revolution” — that single word “in” was taken by many on the radical left as Lennon’s acknowledgment, after considered thought, that violence in the pursuit of political aims was indeed justified in some cases. At a time of increasing unrest in the streets and campuses of Paris and Berkeley, the album’s lyrics seemed to many to mark a reversal of Lennon’s position on the question, which was hotly debated during this period. However, the recording chronology belies the interpretation that from the single to the album Lennon moved from a definite position to one of ambivalence, since despite the single’s earlier release it was the album version that was recorded first.\n\nCult leader Charles Manson persuaded members of his “family” that the album was an apocalyptic message predicting a prolonged race war and justifying the murder of wealthy people.\n\nIn October 1969, a Detroit radio program began to promote theories based on clues supposedly left on The Beatles and other Beatles albums that Paul McCartney had died and been replaced by a lookalike. The ensuing hunt for clues to a cover up, that The Beatles presumably wanted to suppress (and simultaneously publicise), became one of the classic examples of an urban legend.\n\nAs it was their first studio album in almost eighteen months (and coming after the blockbuster success of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band) expectations were high at time of release of The Beatles. The album debuted at number one in the UK on 1 December 1968, (becoming their third album to do so, after Help! and Revolver). It spent seven weeks at the top of the UK charts (including the entire competitive Christmas season), until it was replaced by The Seekers’ Best of the Seekers on 25 January 1969, dropping to number two. However, the album returned to the top spot the next week, spending an eighth and final week at number one. Then, it spent another four weeks on the Top 10, and then dropped the charts quicker than Sgt. Pepper. The White Album was particularly notable for blocking the Beatles follow-up album, Yellow Submarine, which debuted (and peaked at) number three on 8 February 1969, the same week The White Album was dominating the second position on the charts. In all, The Beatles spent 24 weeks on the UK charts, far less than the more than 200 weeks for Sgt. Pepper’s).\n\nIn the United States, the album was received with huge commercial success. It debuted at number 11, jumped to number two, and reached number one in its third week, spending a total of nine weeks at the top. In all, The Beatles spent 155 weeks on the Billboard 200. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, The Beatles is The Beatles’ best-selling album at 19-times platinum and the tenth-best-selling album of all time in the United States. (Each sale is counted as 2 sales, because “The Beatles” is a double record set.)\n\nTwo re-issues in 1978 (one by Capitol Records, the other by Parlophone) saw the album pressed on white vinyl, completing the look of the “white” album. In 1985, EMI Electrola released a DMM (direct metal mastering) white vinyl pressing of the album in Germany, which was imported to the United States in large numbers. Another popular white vinyl pressing was manufactured in France. The 1978 Parlophone white vinyl export pressing and the German DMM pressing are considered by many to be the best-sounding versions of the album. This is due to the use of the famed Neumann lathe on the 1978 export pressing and the use of the DMM process on the 1985 pressing.\n\nOn 7 January 1982, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) released the album in a non-embossed unnumbered version of cover with the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING banner at the top. Neither the poster nor portraits were included. The labels to the discs are white with primarily black text and the Capitol dome logo at three o’clock. The MFSL discs were made with Super Vinyl, a heavy and hard compound that provides an extraordinary quiet playing surface. Although MFSL leased the album from Capitol and used the company’s sub-master, many fans believe they sound superior to the standard British and American pressings. The discs were stored in “rice paper” static-free, dust-free inner sleeves enclosed in an off-white gatefold reinforced stiff board that fit into the custom fabricated album jacket.\n\nThe album was first released on CD on 25 August 1987.\n\nIn 1998, a 30th anniversary reissue of the album was released. The packaging of this release is virtually identical to its vinyl counterpart. It has the same pure white gatefold cover, complete with the title The BEATLES in a slightly raised, embossed graphic at a slight angle. It also included the now-classic sequentially numbered serial number on the front of this cover, thus making this one a real limited edition. The interior of this cover features the song titles on the left-hand side, and the four black-and-white photos of the group members on the right. This version of the cover even accurately mimics the original British vinyl pressing from 1968, with the openings for the discs at the top rather than the sides. There are miniatures of the four full-colour glossy portrait photos included, as well as an exact replica of the poster with the photo collage on one side, and the album’s complete song lyrics on the opposite side. The CDs are housed in black sleeves, which were also used for the original British album. This commemorative double CD album is housed in a clear plastic slipcase.\n\nOn 9 September 2009, new remasters of all The Beatles studio albums were released. For this new release, the slipcover holding the CD digipak is embossed in much the same style as the original sleeve. Although there is no serial number on the front, there is a serial number printed along the edges of the CD version.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/The+Beatles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "The Beatles is the ninth official British album and the fifteenth American album by The Beatles, a double album released in 1968. It is commonly known as The White Album as it has no graphics or text other than the band’s name (and, on the early LP and CD releases, a serial number) on its plain white sleeve. The album was the first the Beatles undertook following the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, and the first released by their own record label, Apple. Originally entitled A Doll’s House, the title was changed when the British progressive rock band Family released the similarly titled Music in a Doll’s House earlier that year.\n\nThe Beatles was written and recorded during a period of turmoil for the group. After visiting the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India and having a particularly productive songwriting session in early 1968, the group returned to the studio for recording from May to October 1968, only to have conflict and dissent drive the group members apart. Drummer Ringo Starr quit the band for a brief time, leaving bassist Paul McCartney to perform drums on some of the album’s songs.\n\nUpon release in November 1968, the album received mixed to positive reviews and reached the number one spot on the charts in the United Kingdom and United States. The album is notable for the eclectic nature of its songs, which has divided critics in evaluating the album’s legacy. Still, The Beatles is regarded as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In 2003, the album was ranked number 10 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of “The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time”.\n\nMost of the songs were conceived during a transcendental meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India in the spring of 1968. Although the retreat, which had required long periods of meditation, was initially conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours—a chance, in John Lennon’s words, to “get away from everything”— both Lennon and Paul McCartney had quickly found themselves in songwriting mode, often meeting “clandestinely in the afternoons in each other’s rooms” to review the new work. “Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,” Lennon would later recall, “I did write some of my best songs there.” Close to forty new compositions had emerged in Rishikesh, twenty-three of which would be laid down in very rough form at Kinfauns, George Harrison’s home in Esher, in May of 1968.\n\nThe Beatles had left Rishikesh before the end of the course, with Ringo Starr and then McCartney departing first, and Lennon and Harrison departing together later. According to some reports, Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed by rumours that Maharishi had made sexual advances toward Mia Farrow, who had accompanied The Beatles on their trip. Shortly after he decided to leave, Lennon wrote a song called “Maharishi” which included the lyrics, “Maharishi/You little twat”; the song became “Sexy Sadie”. According to several authors, Alexis Mardas (aka “Magic Alex”) deliberately engineered these rumours because he was bent on undermining the Maharishi’s influence over each Beatle. In a 1980 interview, Lennon acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song: “I just called him ‘Sexy Sadie’.\n\nThe Beatles was recorded between 30 May 1968 and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios, with some sessions at Trident Studios. Although productive, the sessions were reportedly undisciplined and sometimes fractious, and they took place at a time when tensions were growing within the group. Concurrent with the recording of this album, The Beatles were launching their new multimedia business corporation Apple Corps, an enterprise that proved to be a source of significant stress for the band.\n\nThe sessions for The Beatles marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon’s new girlfriend and artistic partner, Yoko Ono, who would thereafter be a more or less constant presence at all Beatles sessions. Prior to Ono’s appearance on the scene, the individual Beatles had been very insular during recording sessions, with influence from outsiders strictly limited. McCartney’s girlfriend at the time, Francie Schwartz, was also present at some of the recording sessions.\n\nAuthor Mark Lewisohn reports that The Beatles held their first and only 24-hour recording/producing session near the end of the creation of The Beatles, which occurred during the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney, and producer George Martin.\n\nDespite the album’s official title, which emphasised group identity, studio efforts on The Beatles captured the work of four increasingly individualised artists who frequently found themselves at odds. The band’s work pattern changed dramatically with this project, and by most accounts the extraordinary synergy of The Beatles’ previous studio sessions was harder to come by during this period. Sometimes McCartney would record in one studio for prolonged periods of time, while Lennon would record in another, each man using different engineers. At one point in the sessions, George Martin, whose authority over the band in the studio had waned, spontaneously left to go on holiday, leaving Chris Thomas in charge of producing. During one of these sessions, while recording “Helter Skelter”, Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head.\n\nLong after the recording of The Beatles was complete, Martin mentioned in interviews that his working relationship with The Beatles changed during this period, and that many of the band’s efforts seemed unfocused, often yielding prolonged jam sessions that sounded uninspired. On 16 July recording engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with the group since Revolver, announced he was no longer willing to work with the group.\n\nThe sudden departures were not limited to EMI personnel. On 22 August, Starr abruptly left the studio, explaining later that he felt his role was minimised compared to that of the other members, and that he was tired of waiting through the long and contentious recording sessions. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison pleaded with Starr to return, and after two weeks he did. Upon Starr’s return, he found his drum kit decorated with red, white and blue flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison. The reconciliation was, however, only temporary, and Starr’s exit served as a precursor of future “months and years of misery”, in Starr’s words. Indeed, after The Beatles was completed, both Harrison and Lennon would stage similar unpublicised departures from the band. McCartney, whose public departure in 1970 would mark the formal end of the band’s ensemble, described the sessions for The Beatles as a turning point for the group. Up to this point, he observed, “The world was a problem, but we weren’t. You know, that was the best thing about The Beatles, until we started to break up, like during the White Album and stuff. Even the studio got a bit tense then.”\n\nAccording to Lewisohn, McCartney played drums on “Back in the U.S.S.R.” because Starr had left the group during the period when the song was being recorded. Lewisohn also reports that, in the case of “Dear Prudence”, also recorded during Starr’s absence, the three remaining Beatles each made contributions on bass and drums, with the result that those parts may be composite tracks played by Lennon, McCartney and/or Harrison. As of 2010, the actual musician/instrument lineup on the track remains disputed.\n\nThough not formally credited on the album, Eric Clapton played lead guitar on Harrison’s “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”. Harrison explains in The Beatles Anthology that Clapton’s presence temporarily alleviated the studio tension and that all band members were on their best behaviour during his time with the band in the studio. Harrison, who had invited Clapton to the sessions, soon reciprocated by collaborating with Clapton on the song “Badge” for Cream’s last album Goodbye.\n\nClapton was not the only outside musician to sit in on the sessions. Nicky Hopkins provided electric piano for the single cut of “Revolution” (recorded during these sessions); Hopkins also provided acoustic piano on a number of tracks. Several horns were also recorded on the album version of “Revolution 1”. “Savoy Truffle” also features the horn section. Jack Fallon played a bluegrass fiddle on “Don’t Pass Me By”, and a team of orchestral players and background singers appeared on “Good Night” (which was Beatle-free except for Ringo’s vocal).\n\nThe sessions for The Beatles were notable for the band’s formal transition from 4-track to 8-track recording. As work on the album began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting in a storage room for months. This was in accordance with EMI’s policy of testing and customizing new gear, sometimes for months, before putting it into use in the studios. The Beatles recorded “Hey Jude” and “Dear Prudence” at Trident Studios in central London, which had an 8-track recorder. When they learned about EMI’s 8-track recorder, they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries took the machine (without authorization from the studio chiefs) into the Number 2 recording studio at Abbey Road for the band’s use.\n\nSongs\n\nAlthough most of the songs on any given Beatles album are usually credited to the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team, that description is often misleading, and rarely more so than on The Beatles. With this album, each of the four band members began to showcase the range and depth of his individual songwriting talents, and to display styles that would be carried over to his eventual solo career. Indeed, some songs that the individual Beatles were working on during this period eventually were released on solo albums. These include Lennon’s “Look at Me” and “Child of Nature”, eventually reworked as “Jealous Guy”; McCartney’s “Junk” and “Teddy Boy”; and Harrison’s “Not Guilty” and “Circles”.\n\nMany of the songs on the album display experimentation with unlikely musical genres, borrowing directly from such sources as 1930s dance-hall music (in “Honey Pie”), classical chamber music (in “Piggies”), the avant-garde sensibilities of Yoko Ono and John Cage (in “Revolution 9”), and the lush sentimentality of Henry Mancini’s film scores (in “Good Night”). Such diversity was quite unprecedented in global pop music in 1968, and the album’s sprawling approach provoked (and continues to provoke) both praise and criticism from observers. “Revolution 9”, in particular, a densely layered eight-minute-and-thirteen-second sound collage, has attracted both interest and disapproval from both fans and music critics over the years.\n\nThe only western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the acoustic guitar, and thus most of the songs on The Beatles were written and first performed on that instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles (notably “Rocky Raccoon”, “Blackbird”, “Julia”, “Cry Baby Cry”, “I Will” and “Mother Nature’s Son”) and were recorded in the studio either solo, or by only part of the group.\n\nA number of songs were recorded during these sessions but were never included on a Beatles record, including Harrison’s “Not Guilty” (which he rerecorded for his 1979 self-titled album, George Harrison), Lennon’s “What’s the New Mary Jane” (which has been previously recorded), and McCartney’s “Jubilee” (later retitled “Junk” and released on McCartney’s first solo LP).\n\nOthers included “Mean Mr. Mustard” and “Polythene Pam” (both of which would be used for the medley on Abbey Road); “Child of Nature” (recorded with drastically different lyrics as “Jealous Guy” for Lennon’s Imagine); “Etcetera” (a McCartney composition later recorded by the Black Dyke Mills Band as “Thingumybob”); “The Long and Winding Road” (completed in 1969 for the Let It Be LP); “Something” (which ended up on Abbey Road); and “Sour Milk Sea” (which Harrison gave to friend and Apple artist Jackie Lomax for his first LP, Is This What You Want).\n\nOther songs recorded for, but ultimately left off The Beatles received significant exposure via bootlegs, notably Harrison’s “Circles” (which he would eventually re-record as solo tracks and release on his 1982 album, Gone Troppo) and “Not Guilty”, and Lennon’s manic “What’s the New Mary Jane”. More recently, the song “Revolution 1 (Take 20)”, a previously unknown track, surfaced in 2009 on the Europe-only bootleg Revolution: Take…Your Knickers Off and is supposed to connect “Revolution 1” and the avant-garde “Revolution 9” (both of which appeared on The Beatles) in an attempt by Lennon to record one long version of “Revolution” before ultimately splitting the two songs up.\n\nThe Beatles was the first Beatles’ album released by Apple Records, as well as their only original double album. Producer George Martin has said that he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs in order to form a single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band decided against this. Interviewed for the Beatles Anthology, Starr said he now felt it should have been released as two separate albums (that he appropriately named The White Album and The Whiter Album). Harrison felt on reflection that some of the tracks could have been released as B-sides, but “there was a lot of ego in that band”. He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs the group had at the time. McCartney, by contrast, said it was fine as it was and that its wide variety of songs was a major part of the album’s appeal.\n\nThe Beatles shares the same release date (22 November) as The Beatles’ second album, With the Beatles, released five years earlier.\n\nAlthough “Hey Jude” was not intended to be included on any LP release, it was recorded during the White Album sessions and was released as a stand-alone single before the release of The Beatles. “Hey Jude’s” B-side, “Revolution”, was an alternate version of the album’s “Revolution 1”. Lennon had wanted the original version of “Revolution” to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. A new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and a high-energy keyboard solo from Nicky Hopkins was recorded, and was relegated to the flip side of “Hey Jude”. The resulting release — “Hey Jude” on side A and “Revolution” on side B — emerged as the first release on the Beatles’ new Apple Records label. It went on to be the Beatles’ most successful single, with world sales over 5 million by the end of 1968 and 7.5 million by October 1972.\n\nFour tracks from the “White Album” were released on two American and one British single almost eight years after the original album was released. In the summer 1976, to promote the compilation album, Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, EMI’s Parlophone label in the UK and its Capitol label in the US each released a single that contained A and B-sides that appeared on the compilation album. In Britain, Parlophone issued “Back in the U.S.S.R.” as the single. (Its B-side was “Twist and Shout”, which originally appeared on the group’s first album, Please Please Me.) In America, Capitol released “Got to Get You Into My Life” (from the group’s 1966 album, Revolver) on the A-side, but selected “Helter Skelter,” to serve as the flip side. “Helter Skelter” was likely chosen for the B-side because a cover version of the song had been prominently featured in a made-for-TV movie about the Charles Manson murders that had aired on CBS shortly before the release of Rock ‘n’ Roll Music. The singles were successful, with “Got to Get You into My Life” hitting No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and “Back in the U.S.S.R.” hitting No. 18 on the New Musical Express chart in Britain. Both records also helped sell Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, which hit No. 2 in the United States and No. 10 in the UK. With the success of the singles from the compilation album, Capitol followed-up “Got To Get You Into My Life” with the release of another single in November 1976. Instead of taking two more tracks from Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, however, Capitol selected two “White Album” tracks—”Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” as the A-Side, and “Julia” as the B-Side. The “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” single was sold in an individually-numbered white picture sleeve that mimicked the design of the original album. “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, however, as it failed to make the Top Forty, stalling out at No. 49 on Billboard.\n\nThe Beatles was the last Beatles album to be released with a unique, alternate mono mix, albeit one issued only in the UK and a few other countries. Twenty-eight of the album’s 30 tracks (“Revolution 1” and “Revolution 9” being the only exceptions) exist in official alternate mono mixes. Several of these mono mixes are quite different from the stereo versions.\n\nBeatles’ albums after The Beatles (except Yellow Submarine in the UK) occasionally had mono pressings in certain countries (such as Brazil), but these editions—Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road and Let It Be—were in each case mono fold-downs from the regular stereo mixes.\n\nIn the US, mono records were already being phased out; the US release of The Beatles was the first Beatles LP to be issued in stereo only.\n\nThe mono version of The Beatles was made available worldwide (including the US) on 9 September 2009, as part of the Beatles in Mono CD box set.\n\nThe album’s sleeve was designed by Richard Hamilton, a notable pop artist who had organised a Marcel Duchamp retrospective at the Tate Gallery the previous year. Hamilton’s design was in stark contrast to Peter Blake’s vivid cover art for Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band’s name was discreetly embossed slightly below the middle of the album’s right side, and the cover also featured a unique stamped serial number, “to create,” in Hamilton’s words, “the ironic situation of a numbered edition of something like five million copies.” Indeed, the artist intended the cover to resemble the “look” of conceptual art, an emerging movement in contemporary art at the time. Later vinyl record releases in the US showed the title in grey printed (rather than embossed) letters. Early copies on compact disc were also numbered. Later CD releases rendered the album’s title in black or grey. The 30th anniversary CD release was done to look like the original album sleeve, with an embossed title and serial number, including a small reproduction of the poster and pictures (see re-issues).\n\nThe album’s inside packaging included a poster, the lyrics to the songs, and a set of photographs taken by John Kelly during the autumn of 1968 that have themselves become iconic. This is the only sleeve of a Beatles studio album not to show the members of the band on the front.\n\nTape versions of the album did not feature a white cover. Instead, cassette, reel-to-reel, and 8-track versions (first issued on two cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured high contrast black and white (with no grey) versions of the four Kelly photographs. In both the cassette and 8-track versions of the album, the two tapes were sold in a black slip-cover box that bore the title, “The Beatles” and the outline of an apple, embossed in silver. This departure from the LP’s design not only made it difficult for less-informed fans to identify the tape in record stores, but it also led some fans at the time to jokingly refer to the 8-track or cassette not as the “white album” but as the “black tape.” In 1988, Capitol/EMI re-issued the 2-cassette version of the album, still with the same cover artwork as the original cassettes, but without the black slip-cover box.\n\nThe Beatles were at the peak of their global influence and visibility in late 1968. Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, released the previous year, had enjoyed a combination of commercial success, critical acclaim, and immense cultural influence that had previously seemed inconceivable for a pop release. Time, for instance, had written in 1967 that Pepper constituted a “historic departure in the progress of music—any music,” while Timothy Leary, in a widely quoted assessment of the same period, declared that the band were prototypes of “evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with mysterious powers to create a new human species.” After releasing an album that had delivered such critical, commercial, and generational shockwaves, The Beatles faced the inevitable question of what they could possibly do to top it. The next full-length album, whatever it was, was destined to draw considerable scrutiny. The intervening release of Magical Mystery Tour notwithstanding (released as a double-EP package in the UK), The Beatles represented the group’s first major musical statement since Sgt. Pepper, and thus was a highly anticipated event for both the mainstream press and the youth-oriented counter-culture movement with which the band had by this time become strongly associated. Expectations, to say the least, were high.\n\nThe reviews were mixed to mostly positive.\n\n* Tony Palmer, in The Observer, wrote shortly after the album’s release: “If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the greatest songwriters since Schubert, then … the album The Beatles … should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making…”\n* Richard Goldstein, writing in The New York Times on 8 December 1968, described the album as a “major success.”\n* Another review in The New York Times, this one by Nik Cohn, considered the album “boring beyond belief” and described “more than half the songs” as “profound mediocrities.”\n* Alan Smith, in an NME review entitled “The Brilliant, the Bad, and the Ugly,” derided “Revolution #9” as a “pretentious” example of “idiot immaturity” and, in the following sentence, assigned the benediction “God Bless You, Beatles!” to “most of the rest” of the album.\n* The New Rolling Stone Album Guide praises the album but maintains that it has “loads of self-indulgent filler,” identifying “Revolution #9” in particular as “justly maligned,” and suggests that listeners in the CD era, who can program digital players to skip over unwanted tracks, may have an advantage over the album’s original audience.\n\nSome contemporary critics say the album’s inclusion of supposedly extraneous material is a part of its appeal. Stephen Thomas Erlewine’s review for Allmusic contends that:\n\n* “Each song on the sprawling double album The Beatles is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything they can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the White Album interesting is its mess.”\n\nOne important current trend in critical assessments of the album is to draw parallels between the band’s disintegrating ensemble and the chaotic events of the tumultuous year in which The Beatles was created, 1968. Along these lines, Slant Magazine observed that:\n\n* “(The album) reveals the popping seams of a band that had the pressure of an entire fissuring generational/political gap on its back. Maybe it’s because it shows The Beatles at the point where even their music couldn’t hide the underlying tensions between John, Paul, George, and Ringo, or maybe because it was (coincidentally?) released at the tail end of a year anyone could agree was the embittered honeymoon’s end for the Love Generation, the year when, to borrow from a famous Yeats poem, the center decidedly could not hold … for whatever reason, The Beatles is still one of the few albums by the Fab Four that resists reflexive canonization, which, along with society’s continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising.”\n\nIn 1997, The Beatles was named the 10th greatest album of all time in a ‘Music of the Millennium’ poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 17, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number seven in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\n\nIn 2001, the TV network VH1 named it as the 11th greatest album ever.\n\nIt was ranked number 10 in Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003.\n\nIn 2006, the album was chosen by Time Magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time.\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the album’s release the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, published a lengthy article which declared that “Forty years later, this album remains a type of magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled.” Forgiving Lennon’s “more popular than Jesus” remark, the paper called the White Album the “creative summit” of the Beatles’ career, comparing it favourably to contemporary music and taking note of the now antiquated equipment used, concluding that “a listening experience like that offered by the Beatles is truly rare.”\n\nIan MacDonald, in his book Revolution in the Head, argues that The Beatles was the album in which the band’s cryptic messages to its fan base became not merely vague but intentionally and perhaps dangerously open-ended, citing oblique passages in songs like “Glass Onion” (e.g., “the walrus was Paul”) and “Piggies” (“what they need’s a damn good whacking”). These pronouncements, and many others on the album, came to attract extraordinary popular interest at a time when more of the world’s youth were using drugs recreationally and looking for spiritual, political, and strategic advice from The Beatles. Steve Turner, too, in his book A Hard Day’s Write, maintains that, with this album, “The Beatles had perhaps laid themselves open to misinterpretation by mixing up the languages of poetry and nonsense.” Bob Dylan’s songs had been similarly mined for hidden meanings, but the massive countercultural analysis of The Beatles surpassed anything that had gone before.\n\nEven Lennon’s seemingly direct engagement with the tumultuous political issues of 1968 in “Revolution 1” carried a nuanced obliqueness, and ended up sending messages the author may not have intended. In the album’s version of the song, Lennon advises those who “talk about destruction” to “count me out.” As McDonald notes, however, Lennon then follows the sung word “out” with the spoken word “in.” At the time of the album’s release — which followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, “Revolution” — that single word “in” was taken by many on the radical left as Lennon’s acknowledgment, after considered thought, that violence in the pursuit of political aims was indeed justified in some cases. At a time of increasing unrest in the streets and campuses of Paris and Berkeley, the album’s lyrics seemed to many to mark a reversal of Lennon’s position on the question, which was hotly debated during this period. However, the recording chronology belies the interpretation that from the single to the album Lennon moved from a definite position to one of ambivalence, since despite the single’s earlier release it was the album version that was recorded first.\n\nCult leader Charles Manson persuaded members of his “family” that the album was an apocalyptic message predicting a prolonged race war and justifying the murder of wealthy people.\n\nIn October 1969, a Detroit radio program began to promote theories based on clues supposedly left on The Beatles and other Beatles albums that Paul McCartney had died and been replaced by a lookalike. The ensuing hunt for clues to a cover up, that The Beatles presumably wanted to suppress (and simultaneously publicise), became one of the classic examples of an urban legend.\n\nAs it was their first studio album in almost eighteen months (and coming after the blockbuster success of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band) expectations were high at time of release of The Beatles. The album debuted at number one in the UK on 1 December 1968, (becoming their third album to do so, after Help! and Revolver). It spent seven weeks at the top of the UK charts (including the entire competitive Christmas season), until it was replaced by The Seekers’ Best of the Seekers on 25 January 1969, dropping to number two. However, the album returned to the top spot the next week, spending an eighth and final week at number one. Then, it spent another four weeks on the Top 10, and then dropped the charts quicker than Sgt. Pepper. The White Album was particularly notable for blocking the Beatles follow-up album, Yellow Submarine, which debuted (and peaked at) number three on 8 February 1969, the same week The White Album was dominating the second position on the charts. In all, The Beatles spent 24 weeks on the UK charts, far less than the more than 200 weeks for Sgt. Pepper’s).\n\nIn the United States, the album was received with huge commercial success. It debuted at number 11, jumped to number two, and reached number one in its third week, spending a total of nine weeks at the top. In all, The Beatles spent 155 weeks on the Billboard 200. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, The Beatles is The Beatles’ best-selling album at 19-times platinum and the tenth-best-selling album of all time in the United States. (Each sale is counted as 2 sales, because “The Beatles” is a double record set.)\n\nTwo re-issues in 1978 (one by Capitol Records, the other by Parlophone) saw the album pressed on white vinyl, completing the look of the “white” album. In 1985, EMI Electrola released a DMM (direct metal mastering) white vinyl pressing of the album in Germany, which was imported to the United States in large numbers. Another popular white vinyl pressing was manufactured in France. The 1978 Parlophone white vinyl export pressing and the German DMM pressing are considered by many to be the best-sounding versions of the album. This is due to the use of the famed Neumann lathe on the 1978 export pressing and the use of the DMM process on the 1985 pressing.\n\nOn 7 January 1982, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) released the album in a non-embossed unnumbered version of cover with the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING banner at the top. Neither the poster nor portraits were included. The labels to the discs are white with primarily black text and the Capitol dome logo at three o’clock. The MFSL discs were made with Super Vinyl, a heavy and hard compound that provides an extraordinary quiet playing surface. Although MFSL leased the album from Capitol and used the company’s sub-master, many fans believe they sound superior to the standard British and American pressings. The discs were stored in “rice paper” static-free, dust-free inner sleeves enclosed in an off-white gatefold reinforced stiff board that fit into the custom fabricated album jacket.\n\nThe album was first released on CD on 25 August 1987.\n\nIn 1998, a 30th anniversary reissue of the album was released. The packaging of this release is virtually identical to its vinyl counterpart. It has the same pure white gatefold cover, complete with the title The BEATLES in a slightly raised, embossed graphic at a slight angle. It also included the now-classic sequentially numbered serial number on the front of this cover, thus making this one a real limited edition. The interior of this cover features the song titles on the left-hand side, and the four black-and-white photos of the group members on the right. This version of the cover even accurately mimics the original British vinyl pressing from 1968, with the openings for the discs at the top rather than the sides. There are miniatures of the four full-colour glossy portrait photos included, as well as an exact replica of the poster with the photo collage on one side, and the album’s complete song lyrics on the opposite side. The CDs are housed in black sleeves, which were also used for the original British album. This commemorative double CD album is housed in a clear plastic slipcase.\n\nOn 9 September 2009, new remasters of all The Beatles studio albums were released. For this new release, the slipcover holding the CD digipak is embossed in much the same style as the original sleeve. Although there is no serial number on the front, there is a serial number printed along the edges of the CD version.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/The+Beatles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
