  "biography": "The original band line-up included Paul Linehan (as vocalist/bassist), his brother Niall Linehan (as guitarist), and Ashley Keating (on drums).\nNiall Linehan was replaced as guitarist in 2004 by Kevin Pedreschi, who was in-turn replaced by Rory Murphy in 2010. Cian Corbett joined on keyboard duties in 2005.\nCareer\nSigning for the Setanta label in 1991, the group debuted with the album EP1, and the lead track Fashion Crisis Hits New York became an indie hit. The follow-up EP EP.2 was released soon after, which was followed by the band's signing to the Go! Discs label where The Franks partnered with producer Edwyn Collins to record the Happy Busman EP. They found success in the UK, and following a tour in support of Carter USM, an Ian Broudie remix of the LP song After All reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 11, and it also peaked at No. 5 in the Irish chart. The group appeared on BBC Television's Top of the Pops in support of the single.\nAfter a long sabbatical which the band attributed to a \"fear of music\", the group returned with Grand Parade (with contributions from Gus Dudgeon), and the Indian Ocean EP in 1997. This was followed with Beauty Becomes More Than Life in 1998 and Glass in 2000. Setanta released a well received Best Of in 2002. In 2004, Niall Linehan left and was replaced by a friend of the band, Kevin Pedreschi. The band signed a new deal with FIFA Records, and released a retrospective triple album, Souvenirs, in October 2005. A further album, A Renewed Interest In Happiness, was released on 27 October 2006. The band returned to the charts in 2010 by releasing a comeback single entitled The Parson, as part of their \"Seasonal Single Releases\" project, which saw the band release a single per season. The Parson launched as the spring season single, with Let it Out following in the summer, The Clock in the autumn, and a Christmas-themed Song For A Future Love in December.\nTogether with The Sultans of Ping FC and Power of Dreams, the Franks (as they are known by fans) played a number of co-headlining shows as part of the \"Reverberation Tour\" in December 2010. They also toured several festivals in 2011, including Vantastival and Indiependence.\nThe band returned to the studio in August 2011 to work on a new album - released in March 2012. The first single from this album, entitled \"Indie Lovesong\", was released on Valentine's Day 14 February 2012 and was supported by a UK tour. Their 6th studio album was named Greenwich Mean Time and released on 9 March 2012. The album was well received and supported by tours in Europe, USA and Japan.\nIn September 2012 the Frank and Walters embarked on a 20th anniversary celebration tour of their debut album \"Trains, Boats and Planes\".\n(wiki)",

      "biography_en": "The original band line-up included Paul Linehan (as vocalist/bassist), his brother Niall Linehan (as guitarist), and Ashley Keating (on drums).\nNiall Linehan was replaced as guitarist in 2004 by Kevin Pedreschi, who was in-turn replaced by Rory Murphy in 2010. Cian Corbett joined on keyboard duties in 2005.\nCareer\nSigning for the Setanta label in 1991, the group debuted with the album EP1, and the lead track Fashion Crisis Hits New York became an indie hit. The follow-up EP EP.2 was released soon after, which was followed by the band's signing to the Go! Discs label where The Franks partnered with producer Edwyn Collins to record the Happy Busman EP. They found success in the UK, and following a tour in support of Carter USM, an Ian Broudie remix of the LP song After All reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 11, and it also peaked at No. 5 in the Irish chart. The group appeared on BBC Television's Top of the Pops in support of the single.\nAfter a long sabbatical which the band attributed to a \"fear of music\", the group returned with Grand Parade (with contributions from Gus Dudgeon), and the Indian Ocean EP in 1997. This was followed with Beauty Becomes More Than Life in 1998 and Glass in 2000. Setanta released a well received Best Of in 2002. In 2004, Niall Linehan left and was replaced by a friend of the band, Kevin Pedreschi. The band signed a new deal with FIFA Records, and released a retrospective triple album, Souvenirs, in October 2005. A further album, A Renewed Interest In Happiness, was released on 27 October 2006. The band returned to the charts in 2010 by releasing a comeback single entitled The Parson, as part of their \"Seasonal Single Releases\" project, which saw the band release a single per season. The Parson launched as the spring season single, with Let it Out following in the summer, The Clock in the autumn, and a Christmas-themed Song For A Future Love in December.\nTogether with The Sultans of Ping FC and Power of Dreams, the Franks (as they are known by fans) played a number of co-headlining shows as part of the \"Reverberation Tour\" in December 2010. They also toured several festivals in 2011, including Vantastival and Indiependence.\nThe band returned to the studio in August 2011 to work on a new album - released in March 2012. The first single from this album, entitled \"Indie Lovesong\", was released on Valentine's Day 14 February 2012 and was supported by a UK tour. Their 6th studio album was named Greenwich Mean Time and released on 9 March 2012. The album was well received and supported by tours in Europe, USA and Japan.\nIn September 2012 the Frank and Walters embarked on a 20th anniversary celebration tour of their debut album \"Trains, Boats and Planes\".\n(wiki)",

The follow-up album EP.2 was quickly forthcoming.\n\nShortly after signing to the Go! Discs label, The Franks partnered with producer Edwyn Collins to record the Happy Busman EP. Success in the UK was not far away, and following a tour in support of Carter USM, an Ian Broudie remix of the LP track After All reached the top twenty in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 11.\n\nAfter a long sabbatical, the group returned with Grand Parade (with contributions from Gus Dudgeon), and the Indian Ocean EP in 1997. This was followed with Beauty Becomes More Than Life in 1998 and Glass in 2000. Setanta released a well received \"Best of\" in 2002.\n\nIn 2004 Niall Linehan left the band and was replaced by a friend of the band, Kevin Pedreschi. The band signed a new deal with FIFA Records in Ireland, and released a B-sides triple album, Souvenirs, in October 2005.\n\nThe band released a new album, Renewed Interest In Happiness, on October 27th 2006 possibly their most complete work to date.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Frank+and+Walters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The follow-up EP EP.2 was released soon after, which was followed by the band's signing to the Go! Discs label where The Franks partnered with producer Edwyn Collins to record the Happy Busman EP. They found success in the UK, and following a tour in support of Carter USM, an Ian Broudie remix of the LP song After All reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 11, and it also peaked at No. 5 in the Irish chart. The group appeared on BBC Television's Top of the Pops in support of the single.\nAfter a long sabbatical which the band attributed to a \"fear of music\", the group returned with Grand Parade (with contributions from Gus Dudgeon), and the Indian Ocean EP in 1997. This was followed with Beauty Becomes More Than Life in 1998 and Glass in 2000. Setanta released a well received Best Of in 2002. In 2004, Niall Linehan left and was replaced by a friend of the band, Kevin Pedreschi. The band signed a new deal with FIFA Records, and released a retrospective triple album, Souvenirs, in October 2005. A further album, A Renewed Interest In Happiness, was released on 27 October 2006. The band returned to the charts in 2010 by releasing a comeback single entitled The Parson, as part of their \"Seasonal Single Releases\" project, which saw the band release a single per season. The Parson launched as the spring season single, with Let it Out following in the summer, The Clock in the autumn, and a Christmas-themed Song For A Future Love in December.\nTogether with The Sultans of Ping FC and Power of Dreams, the Franks (as they are known by fans) played a number of co-headlining shows as part of the \"Reverberation Tour\" in December 2010. They also toured several festivals in 2011, including Vantastival and Indiependence.\nThe band returned to the studio in August 2011 to work on a new album - released in March 2012. The first single from this album, entitled \"Indie Lovesong\", was released on Valentine's Day 14 February 2012 and was supported by a UK tour. Their 6th studio album was named Greenwich Mean Time and released on 9 March 2012. The album was well received and supported by tours in Europe, USA and Japan.\nIn September 2012 the Frank and Walters embarked on a 20th anniversary celebration tour of their debut album \"Trains, Boats and Planes\".\n(wiki)",
