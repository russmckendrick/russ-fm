  "biography": "Voice of the Beehive are an Anglo-American college radio/alternative pop band, formed in London in 1987 by Californian sisters Tracey Bryn Belland and Melissa Brooke Belland, daughters of Bruce Belland of The Four Preps.\n\nWhen the sisters first sang together they called themselves the Beehive Girls, because of their beehive hairstyles. Their initial success came with the 1988 album Let It Bee, on which they recruited former members from ska band Madness to play guitar and drums. The album was popular on college radio stations, and the success was largely due to their brightly-coloured image and shout-along songs that was an antidote to the doom and gloom college rock scene. Their biggest commercial success came in the early 1990s with the single, Monsters and Angels from the album, Honey Lingers. In 1994 the other members left the band. The sisters decided to continue, recording the album Sex & Misery. The album did not sell well in the UK, and early success in the USA for the single Scary Kisses was poorly capitalised on. In late 1996 their record company refused to extend their contract, and the girls disappeared from the music industry, although they re-formed to play three live dates with The Wonder Stuff in 2003. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Voice+of+the+Beehive\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
