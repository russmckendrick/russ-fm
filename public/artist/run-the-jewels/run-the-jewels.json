  "biography": "Run the Jewels is an American hip-hop duo that consists of emcee/producer El-P and emcee Killer Mike.\n\nIn 2012, El-P produced Killer Mike's critically acclaimed album R.A.P. Music. The following week, Killer Mike appeared on the track \"Tougher Colder Killer\", from El-P's album Cancer 4 Cure. \n\nBoth won the acclaim of media and fans across the globe and led to 2012′s legendary, hugely successful “Into The Wild” tour. One year later, the duo return to satisfy fan demand, and their own creative urges, as Run The Jewels, cementing their musical alliance with a full album of uncompromisingly raw, forward thinking hip-hop. \n\nThey released their self-titled debut album, Run the Jewels, on June 26 2013, via Fool's Gold Records to critical acclaim.\n\nTheir follow-up record, Run the Jewels 2, was announced in August 2014. It was released through Mass Appeal Records, on October 24, 2014. They also announced the release of a traditional remix album of Run the Jewels 2, which will be released via Fool's Gold Records Records in 2015, and a remix album titled Meow the Jewels exclusively featuring \"cat sounds\" which will see guest production from Prince Paul, The Alchemist, Just Blaze, Dan the Automator, and others.\n\nRun the Jewels 3 was digitally released on December 24, 2016, three weeks prior to its previously announced release date of January 13, 2017. Physical release of the album appeared on January 13 in the United States and January 20 elsewhere.\n\nIn June 2017, the track \"Legend Has It\" from Run the Jewels 3 was featured in the teaser trailer for Marvel's Black Panther during game four of the 2017 NBA Finals, and was viewed 89 million times in 24 hours. Multiple Run the Jewels tracks were also featured in the 2017 action film Baby Driver, which also featured a cameo by Killer Mike. In September 2017, Run the Jewels released \"Mean Demeanor\", a track created for the football video game FIFA 18.\n\nIn March 2018, Adult Swim released a Run the Jewels/Rick and Morty crossover music video for \"Oh Mama\". The music was a remix of \"Oh Mama\" from Run the Jewels 3 accompanied by sound effects from a Rick and Morty short. The effort was directed by Juan Meza-León, and was released prior to Run the Jewels headlining the 2018 Adult Swim Festival on October 7, 2018.\n\nOn December 12, 2019, the single \"Legend Has It\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nRun The Jewel's 4th studio album, RTJ4, was released on June 3, 2 days earlier than the pre-determined release date, following the wave of protests about the death of George Floyd in the hands of police brutality. RTJ4 was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 89, based on 26 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 8.8 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Run+the+Jewels\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
