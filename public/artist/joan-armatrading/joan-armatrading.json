  "biography": "Joan Armatrading MBE (born Joan Anita Barbara Armatrading in Basseterre, Saint Kitts on 9 December 1950) and brought up in Birmingham, England, is a British singer, songwriter, and guitarist.\n\nArmatrading has mixed eclectic musical styles over decades of recording and performing. She has had several British hit singles, the biggest of which were \"Love & Affection\", \"Me Myself I\", and \"Drop the Pilot\". Her music is generally pop, with forays into rock, folk, jazz, and even reggae. Her popularity is primarily as an album artist.\n\nShe gained a new audience following her writing and performing \"The Flight of the Wild Geese\", which was used during the opening and end titles for the 1978 film The Wild Geese.\n\nArmatrading first performed in a concert at Birmingham University for her brother at the age of about 16 (circa 1966). She only knew her own songs, but her brother asked her to perform something that would be familiar to the audience; she chose \"The Sound of Silence\".[9] She then performed her own songs around the local area with a friend from school, and played bass and rhythm guitar at local clubs. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Armatrading\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
