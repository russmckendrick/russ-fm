      "biography": "Manic Street Preachers are an alternative rock band from Blackwood, Wales, formed in 1986. Often referred to as \"the Manics\", they are James Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitars), Nicky Wire (bass, occasional vocals) and Sean Moore (drums, backing vocals, occasional trumpet). The band were originally a quartet: lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 February 1995. He was declared presumed deceased in November 2008.\n\nThe Manics released their debut album Generation Terrorists in 1992. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery, outspoken invective and songs about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums retained a politicized and intellectual lyrical style, while adopting a broader alternative rock sound. Enigmatic lyricist Richey Edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words \"4 REAL\" into his arm with a razor blade (narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic. The dark nature of 1994's The Holy Bible reflected the culmination of Edwards' instability.\n\nFollowing Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore, and Wire persisted with the Manic Street Preachers and went on to gain critical and commercial success, becoming one of Britain's premier rock bands. They have had eight top ten albums and fifteen top ten singles. They have reached number one three times, with their 1998 album This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours and the singles \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" (1998) and \"The Masses Against The Classes\" (2000). The Masses Against The Classes Songfacts reports that the latter was the first UK #1 of 2000. They have also won the Best British Album and Best British Group accolades at the BRIT Awards in 1997 and 1999, and were lauded by the NME for their lifetime achievements in 2008. Their ninth studio album, Journal For Plague Lovers, was released on 18th May 2009 and features lyrics Edwards had left behind to the band weeks before his disappearance.\n\nThey came together in 1986, when James Dean Bradfield, Nicky Wire, Sean Moore and rhythm guitarist Flicker formed Betty Blue in the small South Wales town of Blackwood. Two years later, Flicker had left and Nicky's friend Richey Edwards (previously the group's driver) joined in his place. Richey would later say in Vox magazine, \"If you built a museum to represent Blackwood, all you could put in it would be shit. We used to meet by this opening called Pen-y-Fan. It was built when the mines closed down but now the water has turned green and slimy. They put 2,000 fish in it, but they died. There's a whirlpool in the middle where about two people die every year\". A bleak image, then, but it provided the necessary fuel to drive the band.\n\nInspired by the passion of The Clash, and moved by Thatcher's suppression of the miners, the band's lyrics exploded with politicised anger. Their first single, the self-financed Suicide Alley, didn't make great waves, and the band moved to London. There, they found a sympathetic character in the form of Bob Stanley: later a member of St Etienne, but then a freelancer for the Melody Maker.\n\nStanley released a collection of their demos as the New Art Riot EP in June 1990. It caught the attention of Philip Hall, who became their publicist and co-manager.\n\nIn early 1991 Heavenly released Motown Junk, an inspired three-minute punk blast. Later that year it was followed by You Love Us, a swaggering, arrogant self-regarding slice of brilliance.\n\nThe Manics paved the way for a resurgence of guitar bands in Wales. In the press, they were forced to live with punning headlines referring to sheep, boyos and leeks - they got all the clich√©s out of the way so the bands of the so-called Cool Cymru would be taken more seriously.\n\nYet their image often overshadowed the music. On 15 May 1991 came a turning point for the Manics. Following a gig at Norwich Arts Centre, Steve Lamacq, then writing for the NME, argued with the band that they were a cartoon band - not real punks. The band refuted this, but still Lamacq persisted. Frustrated, Richey Edwards took a razor and calmly carved the words 4 REAL into his forearm. Lamacq was horrified; Richey needed 17 stitches. Six days later the Manics signed to Sony. Richey had suffered from depression for many years, and self-mutilation had become increasingly common for him. But the Norwich incident was the first time the guitarist had aired his emotional problems in public.\n\nIn February 1992 the debut album Generation Terrorists was released. Heavily influenced by Appetite For Destruction, Richey said of it, \"We wanted to sign to the biggest record label in the world, put out a debut album that would sell 20 million, and then break up. Get massive and then just throw it all away\". The album sold 250,000 copies worldwide. Predictably they didn't split up, but the album polarised opinion between those that saw them as the new saviours of rock and roll, and detractors who considered them contrived and insincere. Not that the Manics cared: they were off on their first American tour, shortly after the LA riots, and singles such as Slash 'N' Burn and Motorcycle Emptiness were climbing up the charts.\n\nThe second Manics album was released in June 1993. Gold Against The Soul was overproduced and less passionate, but did contain the classic songs La Tristesse Durera (Scream To A Sigh) and From Despair To Where. However, they also chose to support Bon Jovi for a string of unwise live dates. The troubles continued with the death on 7 December 1993 of their mentor Philip Hall, who had been battling cancer for two years. Meanwhile, Richey's problems were worsening. Weighing less than six stone and subjecting his body to drinking and cutting binges, he was eventually admitted to the Priory in Roehampton.\n\nRichey's despair was documented in what is now considered the Manics' masterpiece, 1994's 'The Holy Bible'. Unremittingly bleak, the opening song Yes contained the lines \"I eat and I dress and I wash and I still can say thank you / Puking, shaking, sinking / Can't shout, can't scream, I hurt myself to get pain out\". The song was about prostitution, but every line emanated from Richey's fragile state of mind. He rejoined the band for tours with Therapy? and Suede (and an early incarnation of Vitriol I.D.) in Europe, and a series of frantic shows at the London Astoria in December. The final night saw them destroying 10,000 worth of their equipment. \"We'll never be that good again,\" said Nicky after the event. It was also their last live appearance as a four-piece.\n\nAlthough they had never found transatlantic success, at the beginning of 1995 they were preparing to give America one last try. However, on 1 February Richey walked out of the Embassy hotel in London and never returned. His passport and money were found in his Cardiff Bay flat, and two weeks later his car was discovered beside the Severn Bridge - a notorious local suicide spot. The file on his disappearance remains open.\n\n\"We decided to carry on in April,\" said Nicky Wire in The Guardian, \"after two months of waiting by the phone and feeling ill and exhausted. We thought we'd been so close, and in the end we couldn't do anything for him.\" September saw the band record a cover of Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head for the War Child \"Help\" album, and by January 1996 the Manics were recording their comeback album 'Everything Must Go'. It was released on 20 May to critical acclaim, went double platinum and yielded four top ten singles: 'A Design For Life', the title track, 'Kevin Carter' and 'Australia'. The sound represents a cross between the heavy rock of 'Gold Against The Soul' and a new, less agressive, almost Britpop like sound.\n\nTwo Brit Awards later, they released the LP This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours which gave the band their first number one single in If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next, perhaps the only song that references the Spanish Civil War to ever appear on Top of the Pops. \n\nOn December 31st 1999 the band said goodbye to the 20th Century with a gig at Cardiff Millennium Stadium, attended by upwards of 50,000 people. This was followed by their second number one single, The Masses Against The Classes, which hit the top spot despite not having a video or marketing support from their record company.\n\nShortly afterwards, Nicky stated that \"the fourth era of the Manics is beginning\".\nThe fourth era, so far, has involved an audience with Fidel Castro in Cuba, the 2001 album Know Your Enemy, and continuing success. Their long awaited greatest hits collection, Forever Delayed, appeared in October 2002, followed in 2003 by Lipstick Traces, a two-disc collection of covers, B-sides, and outtakes including the last song recorded with Richey, 'Judge Yr'self'.\n\nThe Manics returned in November 2004 with the more reflective Lifeblood, which featured the singles The Love Of Richard Nixon and Empty Souls, both of which went straight in at number two in the charts. \n\nNot to rest on their laurels, the band released a 10th anniversary edition of The Holy Bible in December 2004 which included a digitally remastered version of the original album, a never before heard U.S mix and a DVD of live performances and extras.\n\nIn April 2005 the Manics released a limited 3 track E.P. titled God Save The Manics as a free download but with hard copies distributed also without cost at the final date of their small, intimate 'Past Present and Future' tour at Hammersmith Apollo, London - their last show before a two year hiatus.\n\nLater that year the band contributed the new track Leviathan to September's War Child charity album Help: A Day in the Life, becoming one of the few bands to contribute tracks to both albums. \n\n2006 saw both James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire releasing solo albums, The Great Western and I Killed the Zeitgeist respectively. But both insisted that this in no way meant an end to the Manics and in December the band headlined XFM's Winter Wonderland gig in Manchester.\n\n2007 sees the band enter yet another era with their 8th studio album, Send Away The Tigers, which was released on May 7th.\n\nThe album Journal For Plague Lovers was released in May 2009 and features lyrics left to the band by Richey before he disappeared. They released several different versions of the album, including a special edition, which has a book featuring copies of the original typed lyrics and pictures that went with them, and a bonus disc with all the original demos, recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, which they say is one of their favourite studios.\n\nTheir 10th studio album, Postcards from a Young Man, was released in September 2010. The album features several guest artists: Duff McKagan on A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun, John Cale on Auto-Intoxication and Ian McCulloch on Some Kind of Nothingness. A deluxe edition was also released containing a bonus disc with the original demos on it.\n\nIn 2011 the band released their second compilation  National Treasures- The Complete Singles Collection, a release preceded by new single  This Is The Day a cover of a ¬¥¬®The The song. The collection featured every single released since and including Motown Junk.\n\nhttp://www.manicstreetpreachers.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "In January 1995, the members of Manic Street Preachers entered House in the Woods, a studio in Surrey (on the outskirts of London), to begin work on their fourth record. It was early days for the follow-up to their bleak, brutal masterpiece <i>The Holy Bible</i> (1994), a chance to swap ideas about where to go next and run through the handful of new songs they‚Äôd already written. But in the coming days everything changed for the four best friends from Blackwood, Wales. Guitarist and co-lyricist Richey Edwards disappeared from a London hotel room ahead of a planned promotional trip to the US. He was never seen again, eventually declared presumed dead in 2008.\n\nAt the heart of <i>Everything Must Go</i> is the story of how his former bandmates‚Äîsinger and guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist and lyricist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore‚Äîput the pieces back together. It was a few months after Edwards‚Äô disappearance that they decided to get in a room to see how‚Äî<i>if</i>‚Äîthis could work. One song lit the way. In ‚ÄúA Design for Life‚Äù, the Manics had written a modern classic, a song that fused the rock dynamism of 1993‚Äôs <i>Gold Against the Soul</i> album with orchestral bombast and a lyric documenting the working-class struggle to form an irresistible, defiant sing-along. Their intellect and melodic talent had never been paired quite so explosively.\n\nRecorded with producer Mike Hedges in a French ch√¢teau‚Äîa world away from the dingy Cardiff studio that the Manics occupied for <i>The Holy Bible</i>‚Äî<i>Everything Must Go</i> was a record made up of anthem after sing-along anthem, but these songs had catharsis in their bones. On the surface, there were the subjects they were directly about: award-winning war photographers (the choppy indie rock of ‚ÄúKevin Carter‚Äù); expressionist artists battling Alzheimer‚Äôs (the icy, New Order-ish groove of ‚ÄúInteriors (Song for Willem de Kooning)‚Äù); escapism (‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù‚Äôs heady, riffy rush); caged animals (the harp-assisted acoustic beauty of ‚ÄúSmall Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky‚Äù). Dig a little deeper, though, and every song seemed to be holding up a mirror to something a little closer to home. Grief, loss, love, forward-motion, these are the elements running right through <i>Everything Must Go</i>.\n\nFive Edwards lyrics would make it onto the record, the deal being that the song had to have been started before he went missing. In that sense, <i>Everything Must Go</i> closed a chapter for the Manics, but another one opened. Released in May 1996, it went on to sell over two million copies and made the trio one of the biggest British bands of the ‚Äô90s, earning them Best British Group and Best Album at the 1997 BRIT Awards. A masterpiece record in a decade that wasn‚Äôt short of masterpiece records, <i>Everything Must Go</i> was never the sound of a band leaving everything behind. They took it all with them. This was Manic Street Preachers building a bridge to the future.",

            "content": "Everything Must Go is the fourth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 20 May 1996, through Epic Records, and was the first record released by the band following the disappearance of lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards.\n\nReleased at the height of Britpop in the mid-1990s, the album was a commercial and critical success, it reached its peak in the UK on separate occasions, debuting and peaking at number 2 in the UK Albums Chart and earned the band accolades in the 1997 Brit Awards. It represented a shift in the group's sound due to Edwards' departure. The album charted in mainland Europe, Asia and Australia, eventually selling over two million copies. Everything Must Go is frequently featured and voted highly in lists for one of the best albums of all time by many music publications such as NME and Q.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. \"A Design for Life\" reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, spending 3 weeks in the top 10 and a total of 14 weeks in the Top 100 being certified Silver in the UK, for sales above 200.000 copies. \"Everything Must Go\", the second single, peaked at number 5, enjoying 10 weeks in the UK Top 100. \"Kevin Carter\", the third single, peaked at number 9, spending 8 weeks in the UK Top 100, being the single from the album that spent the least weeks in the charts because the last single, \"Australia\", reached number 7 and despite tumbling to number 31 in the second sales week, managed to stay in the UK Singles Chart Top 100 for 9 weeks. All the singles thus charted in the UK Top 10, between 1996 and 1997. \"Further Away\" was released in October 1996, but only in Japan, replacing the UK single \"Kevin Carter\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/Everything+Must+Go\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
