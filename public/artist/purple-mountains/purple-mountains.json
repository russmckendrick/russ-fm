Although the band primarily existed as a recording project for most of its existence, in January 2009 Berman announced his retirement from music in hopes of finding a meaningful way of undoing the damage that his estranged father Richard (a lobbyist for the alcohol and firearm industries) had brought upon society. In early 2019, Berman returned to music under the new band name Purple Mountains, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 2019, which would be the final musical project attributed to him before his death on August 7, 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Purple+Mountains\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
