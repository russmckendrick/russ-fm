  "biography": "Kim Gordon (born 28 April 1953 in Rochester, NY, United States) is chiefly known as the former bass player and singer (along with Lee Ranaldo and her then partner Thurston Moore) of the alternative rock band Sonic Youth (1981-2011). \n\nThe demise of Sonic Youth coincided with the dissolution of her marriage to Moore. Gordon's take on this painful story is in her post-Sonic Youth memoir, 'Girl in a Band' (2015).\n\nDuring and after Sonic Youth's existence she has taken part in many experimental side-projects, notably with DJ Olive and in the noise pop girl band Free Kitten. She is in a duo called Body/Head and, in 2019, finally released her début full-length as a solo artist: No Home Record.\n\nGordon is also involved in the field of contemporary art, curating exhibits and devising audiovisual installations. \n\nOn September 12, 2016, Gordon released her first solo single, \"Murdered Out\", followed on August 20, 2019 by a second solo single, \"Sketch Artist\". A third track \"Air BnB\" was released on September 11. All tracks appear on her first solo record on Matador Records, \"No Home Record\", which was released on October 13, 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Gordon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
