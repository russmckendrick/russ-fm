      "biography": "The Brand New Heavies are an acid jazz and funk group formed in 1985 in Ealing in west London.\nThe Brand New Heavies began in the 1980s as an instrumental acid jazz group called Brother International.\nThe group came up with the Heavies name after signing their first record contract, borrowing from a liner note on a James Brown single declaring the artist \"Minister of New Super Heavy Funk\". As The Brand New Heavies they gained a cult following in the London club scene and soon signed to Cooltempo as acid jazz replaced rare groove in clubs. The band issued a debut recording for Eddie Piller's Acid Jazz label in 1990 with Jay Ella Ruth as lead singer.\nA single, \"Got to Give\", came out on Cooltempo before the Brand New Heavies signed to Acid Jazz Records and released Brand New Heavies to critical acclaim. The band signed to a division of Chrysalis Records in the UK, and American distribution was picked up by influential label Delicious Vinyl, and N'Dea Davenport (who had signed an artist development deal with Delicious Vinyl) joined the group. A revamped version of the first album with vocals by N'Dea Davenport was then released, and the singles \"Dream Come True\", \"Never Stop\" and \"Stay This Way\", all with Davenport on lead vocals, became hits on both sides of the Atlantic, with the latter becoming a music video directed by Douglas Gayeton that saw heavy rotation on MTV.\nThe group's appearance with MC Serch (formerly of 3rd Bass) and Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest) at a performance in New York City, inspired the group to incorporate elements of hip hop music. Their next album was the critically acclaimed Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1, which included collaborations with Guru of Gang Starr and The Pharcyde, among others, but lacked any female vocals.\nWhile under management by Colin Lester's and Ian McAndrew's Wildlife Entertainment, The Brand New Heavies released Brother Sister (1994) which was the last album for a while with N'Dea Davenport, who had left to complete her solo album (which she had put on hold to join the Heavies). The album spawned more singles, though one of them, a cover of Maria Muldaur's \"Midnight at the Oasis\", was popular only in the UK because it was not included in the US version of the album.\nSiedah Garrett joined the group for their next album, Shelter (1997). It contained the minor hit, the Carole King-penned song \"You've Got a Friend\" that was originally made famous by James Taylor. Again, though, this song did not appear on the US version of the album. The album also contained the hit \"Sometimes\". The remix of \"Sometimes\" included the rap vocals of Q-Tip.\nThe Brand New Heavies then released their greatest hits album, Trunk Funk - The Best of The Brand New Heavies (2000) with Carleen Anderson on vocals for some newly recorded songs, followed by the Japan only album We Won't Stop (2003) featuring a variety of vocalists and Allaboutthefunk (2004) featuring British singer Nicole Russo on vocals.\n\nFor We Won't Stop album, The Brand New Heavies relied on singer/songwriter Sy Smith for the bulk of the female vocals. Original member Jan Kincaid takes the lead on three of the tracks, and Los Angeles-based poet Gina Loring makes several appearances on the album. Where the Heavies typical sound had typically been more 1970s funk-styled and acoustically driven, We Won't Stop sees the band experimenting with more electronic elements and contemporary R&B.\nThe album marked the first commercial release of \"What Do You Take Me For\", the band's lone track featuring former flagship lead vocalist N'Dea Davenport. The track would be later re-recorded in a more modern configuration with Nicole Russo on lead for the Allabouthefunk album. The sound and musical arrangement heard on these first releases of \"Music\", \"Love Is...\", and the title track \"We Won't Stop\" were re-recorded with new leads on N'Dea Davenport's 2006 return to the band for the comeback album Get Used To It.\nIn April 2006, the Brand New Heavies reunited with N'Dea Davenport and former label Delicious Vinyl. A new album, Get Used to It was released on 27 June 2006 via Starbucks and more traditional music retail outlets. The album was recorded in New York and London; and the lead single \"I Don't Know Why (I Love You)\" was issued in early May. The single was notable for being one of very few late releases to feature the trademarked A Tom Moulton Mix, as he had been asked to contribute remixes. Later that year, their Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1 album track \"Jump 'N' Move\" featuring Jamal-ski was featured on the soundtrack for the 2006 computer animated feature film Happy Feet and the in-game soundtrack for 2004's NBA Live 2005 and 2009's NBA 2k10. The band toured at the end of 2006.\nThe Brand New Heavies released a 2-CD album Live In London in October 2009 and worked with Lanc√¥me on an ad campaign, resulting in the 2009 single \"C'est Magnifique.\"\nThe Heavies released a free download album called \"Dunk Your Trunk\" in November 2011, available through blog.pedigreecuts.com and Soundcloud. The album, recorded in only four days and described as 'funky library music' is directed at 'TV and Movie people to add to their programmes and films'. The band is planning to release their yet-to-be-named new studio album in early 2013 featuring N'Dea Davenport on vocals. Their new single \"Sunlight\" featuring N'Dea Davenport was previewed to select fans on 3 October 2012. The band also announced recently on their Facebook page that they will be releasing Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 2 in 2013, a long talked about follow-up to 1992's Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1, where various rap artists fronted the band.",
