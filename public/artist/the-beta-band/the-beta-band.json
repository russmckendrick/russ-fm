  "biography": "The Beta Band  (originally 1996-2004, reformed 2025) are an indie rock group from Edinburgh, Scotland who received much critical acclaim and achieved a cult following. Their music primarily explored post-rock,—especially first wave post-rock—neo-psychedelia and indietronica, as well as foreshadowing folktronica.\n\nTheir music has been featured on numerous film and TV soundtracks. The song \"Dry the Rain\" from their 1997 debut EP, Champion Versions, later to be released on the 3 EP's album, was possibly their most popular track and was famously featured in the John Cusack film, High Fidelity. The song \"Smiling\" from the self titled album \"The Beta Band\" is the background music to the UK's Soccer AM, Cross-Bar challenge.   \"Needles in My Eyes\" was featured on a fourth season episode of House MD.\n\nWell known fans include John Cusack, Mani, from Primal Scream and Stone Roses and Noel Gallagher. \n\nTheir live performances were legendary, often ending with the whole band playing percussion. Their dancing and energy got the whole audience moving, often in the same style as their idols on stage. Their \"Best of\" CD contains a CD of them playing live at the Shepherds Bush Empire in one of their final gigs and  manages to capture some of this energy. It has been suggested, sometimes by the band themselves, that they were better live than recorded.\n \nSteve has now released an album under his own name after his post-Beta Band projects Black Affair and King Biscuit Time, John, Robin and Gordon Anderson aka Lone Pigeon have formed The Aliens (www.myspace.com/thealiens1) and Rich is The General & Duchess Collins. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beta+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
