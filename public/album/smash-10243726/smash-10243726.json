      "biography": "The Offspring is an American punk rock band from Orange County, California, formed in 1984. They are widely credited, alongside fellow California pop punk bands Sublime, Green Day, Bad Religion, and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States in the 1990s. Known as Manic Subsidal until 1986, the band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Dexter Holland, lead guitarist Noodles, bassist Greg K. and drummer Pete Parada. Parada replaced former drummer Adam \"Atom\" Willard in 2007, during the recording of the band's eighth studio album, Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace, and has been a member of the band since.\nThe band's first three albums for the independent record labels Nemesis and Epitaph earned them a following. Their 1994 third studio album Smash became a breakout success and eventually sold over 12 million copies worldwide, setting a record for most albums sold on an independent label. The critical praise given to Smash garnered attention from labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring would sign in 1996. Their first album for Columbia, Ixnay on the Hombre was released in 1997 and was well received by critics. The Offspring continued to achieve success with their three follow-up albums, Americana (1998), Conspiracy of One (2000) and Splinter (2003), reaching multi-platinum, platinum and gold status respectively. Splinter was followed five years later by Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace (2008), which was also successful, due to the album's second single \"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\" reaching number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for 11 weeks and becoming their only gold single in America to date. Their latest studio album, Days Go By, was released on June 26, 2012.\nThe Offspring has sold over 36 million albums worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, and many of their albums have sold over a million units.",

      "editorial_notes": "Arriving on the heels of Green Day’s blockbuster <i>Dookie</i>, The Offspring’s third album completed the one-two punch of records that forever transformed the ’90s alt-rock landscape into a pop-punk playground. But compared to their Californian peers—who benefitted from Warner Brothers’ promotional muscle—The Offspring were an even more unlikely success story, given that <i>Smash</i> lived up to its truth-in-advertising title as a shoestring release issued through Bad Religion’s Epitaph Records imprint. At more than 10 million copies sold, it became the biggest-selling independent release of all time. <br /> \nBut even in a post-Nirvana marketplace that was more receptive to aggressive sounds, you certainly couldn’t accuse the Orange County band of taking the obvious path to stardom. <i>Smash</i>’s breakthrough single, “Come Out and Play”, not only represented a change in pace from The Offspring’s typical pogo-ready thrashers, it sounded like absolutely nothing else on radio at the time—an eccentric, insidiously catchy account of L.A. gangland violence spiked with a Latino-accented spoken-word hook and a wobbly Arabian guitar melody that snake-charmed millions of non-punks into the mosh pit. But if the song had all the makings of a novelty hit, <i>Smash</i> confirmed The Offspring’s staying power by harnessing their hardcore-schooled abandon into the steely, grungy grooves of “Gotta Get Away” and “Self Esteem”. And in these more controlled environments, frontman Dexter Holland emerged as one of the most charismatic and commanding vocalists in modern rock, flexing a mix of authentic, street-level angst and arena-ready bravado on the road-rage anthem “Bad Habit”. Riotous and irreverent in equal measure, <i>Smash</i> took a battering ram to the divide between the underground and the mainstream, clearing a path for the Warped Tour generation’s takeover of American youth culture.",

            "content": "Smash is the third studio album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released on April 8, 1994 through Epitaph Records. The album was the band's last collaboration with record producer Thom Wilson, who produced their previous two albums, and also their last release on Epitaph (however, that label released their next album in Europe). Smash met high critical reception upon its release, and is now considered a classic punk rock album by fans, critics, and the band members themselves alike. The album was also responsible for bringing The Offspring to the attention of a mainstream punk audience. Smash was the band's first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number four and topped the Heatseeker's chart. Smash produced four hit singles for the band: \"Come Out and Play\", \"Self Esteem\", \"Gotta Get Away\" and the radio-only single \"Bad Habit\". With sales continuing in the sixteen years since its release, the album has gone on to be certified 6x Platinum in the United States and 4x Platinum in Australia. Although Smash has a dark, punk rock sound, the album is heavily influenced by the emerging pop punk scene. Bands like Green Day and Rancid were gaining popularity, and riding on this wave of popularity, Smash's singles became modern radio rock hits. An example of this was the success of The Offspring's first major single release, \"Come Out and Play\", which reached #1 on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and has become one of the band's signature songs. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Offspring/Smash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
