      "biography": "Huey Lewis & the News is an American rock band based in San Francisco, California. They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, scoring a total of 19 top-ten singles across the US Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary and Mainstream Rock charts. Their greatest success was with their number-one album, 'Sports'. Their worldwide fame expanded when their recording of \"The Power of Love\" was featured as a key track in the 1985 movie \"Back to the Future\" (in which Huey Lewis made a cameo appearance). The song became a number-one hit, and it was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nFrom a first single in 1979, the group successfully combined a pop rock and power pop (and sometimes, a blues rock) influenced backing with harmony side-vocals and Lewis' strident voice, and the band had numerous hit songs during the 1980s and early 1990s. These include \"The Power of Love\" and \"Back in Time\" (both of which were featured in the film \"Back to the Future\"), \"I Want a New Drug\", \"Doin' It All (For My Baby)\", \"Do You Believe in Love?\" \"Hip to Be Square\", \"Stuck With You\", and \"Jacob's Ladder\". Huey Lewis shared three Grammy awards, an American Music Award, and a People's Choice Award along with several artists for his role singing the 1985 charity song \"We Are the World\" as well.\n\n=Albums=\nHuey Lewis & the News (1980) \nPicture This (1982) [#13 U.S. Gold] \nSports (1983) [#1 U.S. 7x Platinum]\nBack to the Future Soundtrack (1985) [Gold]\nFore!

      "editorial_notes": "“When I listen to the <i>Sports</i> record now, I realise it’s a record of its time,” Huey Lewis told Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig on an episode of Apple Music’s Time Crisis. “It’s a collection of singles—that’s what was going on. That’s the only way you could exist.” It is tempting to say that if you looked up 1983 in the dictionary, you would find the cover of Huey Lewis & The News’ third album <i>Sports</i>, but that doesn’t exactly track. (Why would a year be listed in the dictionary?) Yet the absolutely hit-laden album is such a precise time capsule of the moment when the ’80s became “the ’80s” that later generations may know it best as a ubiquitous <i>American Psycho</i> reference. \n\nLewis’ proudly un-hip taste (“I come from R&B, my favourite singer’s Johnny Taylor,” he says) proved to be wise counter-programming coming out of the ’70s as a new form of radio-friendly rock was taking shape. For all the album’s beer-commercial trappings, right down to the sports-bar cover art, its architect was the thirtysomething son of first-wave Marin County hippies whose idea of counterculture rebellion was to start a band with a lead saxophonist. \n\nLewis had been playing harmonica in the Bay Area band Clover for much of the ’70s—even on Thin Lizzy’s <i>Live and Dangerous</i>—and by the time he formed his own band, he knew how to play the game: “We’re recording in ’81, ’82—there’s only one avenue to success and that’s radio,” he says. “That’s where you had to be to exist. There was no other way of making a living in the music business. We aimed every song at radio and [made] each one different—one kind of R&B-ish, one kind of a rock tune, one kind of a ballad—because we didn’t know which one was going to hit or what.”\n\nWith two-thirds of its tracklist essentially comprising a greatest-hits collection, <i>Sports</i> went on to sell some 10 million copies. Among those six hits were the shout-your-city’s-name-here opener “The Heart of Rock and Roll” and the winking “I Want a New Drug”, revelling in its retro regular-guy style at a moment when MTV-driven avant-garde electro-pop was in vogue. “We knew we needed a hit,” Lewis says. “We didn’t think we were going to have six of them.”",

            "content": "Sports is the third album by rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released on September 15, 1983, by Chrysalis Records. It reached #1 on the Billboard 200 on June 30, 1984, and ultimately charted for 160 weeks. Sports was ranked #2 on the Billboard year-end album chart for 1984 and spawned four top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Heart and Soul\" and \"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" earning Grammy Award nominations. Sports also did very well internationally, where most of its singles charted in the top 40 in multiple countries. The album has been certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" was developed after the band performed at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio in 1980, which they had been told was a \"great rock & roll town\". The following day, Lewis told his bandmates that he felt the heart of rock and roll really was in Cleveland and thought the sentiment would make for a good song, but the band convinced him to slightly alter the lyrics to \"the heart of rock & roll is still beating\".\n\n\"Bad Is Bad\" was penned with Lewis' original band, Clover. It was written in the late 1970s while Lewis was working with Thin Lizzy, whose frontman Phil Lynott liked the song so much that he would sing a fast paced version at some of his concerts. Another version of \"Bad Is Bad\" appeared on Dave Edmunds' album Repeat When Necessary (1979), featuring Lewis on harmonica.\n\nThe idea for \"I Want a New Drug\" came to Lewis during a car ride to his lawyer's office, and he wrote down the majority of the lyrics upon arriving. After Lewis made an unsuccessful attempt to put the idea to music with bassist Mario Cipollina, guitarist Chris Hayes developed new music for the final song on his own.\n\n\"Walking on a Thin Line\", written by Andre Pessis and former Clover member Kevin Wells, was about the poor treatment of veterans who returned home from the Vietnam War. \"Finally Found a Home\", inspired by an offhand comment about \"ticky-tacky\" houses near an airport, later progressed into a song about having a career in the music business. Saxophonist/guitarist Johnny Colla wrote the music for \"If This Is It\" alone and gave the song to Lewis, who penned the lyrics on a tour bus. \"You Crack Me Up\", written by Lewis and Cipollina, was based on various people the band had encountered in the parking lot of Uncle Charlie's, a bar the band had frequently performed at before they achieved mainstream success.\n\nSports also contains cover versions of \"Heart and Soul\", written by the songwriting team of Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, and \"Honky Tonk Blues\", written by Hank Williams.\n\n\"Back in the day you wanted your albums to have a theme, and Sports' theme was really a collection of singles ... It was really a record for its time. In the 80s, the way radio was programmed, if you didn't have a hit record you weren't going to be able to make any more records. That was it, period. So our priority was to come up with hit singles. Every tune we aimed for radio 'cause we didn't know which one was going to be a hit. We just knew we needed a frickin' hit, period. And fortunately we got 'em.\"\n—Huey Lewis; Billboard magazine, 2013 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Huey+Lewis+&+The+News/Sports\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
