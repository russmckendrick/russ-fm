      "biography": "Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed by brothers Ron (keyboards) and Russell Mael (vocals) in Los Angeles. The duo is known for their quirky approach to songwriting; their music is often accompanied by sophisticated and acerbic lyrics, often about women, and sometimes containing literary references, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified by the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. Russell Mael has a distinctive wide-ranging voice, while Ron Mael plays keyboards in an intricate and rhythmic style. They have been much more successful in Europe than in their native U.S., though they maintain a loyal cult following in the States.\n\nThe band initially formed as Halfnelson before changing their name to Sparks in 1972. Early career highlights included \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" in 1979, resulting from a collaboration with Giorgio Moroder and marking a stylistic shift towards new wave/synth-pop; \"When I'm With You\", which made the Australian and French Singles Charts in 1980; the single \"I Predict\", which provided Sparks' first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single \"Cool Places\" with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'\", which was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994.\n\nTheir frequently changing styles and visual presentations have kept the band at the forefront of modern, artful pop music. The 2002 release of Lil' Beethoven, the duo's self-proclaimed \"genre-defining opus\", fused repetitive song structures with orchestral arrangements, and brought them renewed critical success. In 2015, the band released an album with Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, as the supergroup FFS, titled FFS. In 2017, returning to a rock-group format, Sparks released Hippopotamus, which entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 7, as did their next album, A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, released in 2020, bringing their tally of UK Top 10 albums to four. In 2021, Sparks were involved in two films: the Leos Carax musical film Annette for which they wrote all songs (winning the César Award for Best Original Music), and the Edgar Wright documentary The Sparks Brothers recounting the history of the band. The band's latest album, The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte, was released on May 26, 2023, via Island Records.",

Known for their quirky approach to songwriting, Sparks' music is often accompanied by intelligent, sophisticated, and acerbic lyrics, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. They are also noted for Russell Mael's distinctive falsetto voice and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style.\n\nWhile achieving chart success in various countries around the world including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and the United States, they have enjoyed a cult following since their first releases. During the late 1970s, when in collaboration with Giorgio Moroder (and Telex subsequently), Sparks reinvented themselves as a new wave/synth-pop band, and abandoned the traditional rock band line-up. Their frequently changing styles and visual presentations have kept the band at the forefront of modern, artful pop music.\n\nThe 2002 release of Lil' Beethoven, their \"genre-defying opus\", as well as the more recent albums Hello Young Lovers (2006, their 20th studio album), Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008), and their latest fantasy musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009–2010) have brought Sparks renewed critical and commercial success, and seen them continue to \"steer clear of pop conventions.\" The band also released an album with Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, as the supergroup FFS, titled FFS, released in 2015.\n\nSparks are best known for the songs \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" in 1979; \"When I'm With You\" which topped the French Singles Chart in 1980; the single \"I Predict\", which provided Sparks' first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single \"Cool Places\" with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'\" which topped the German and European charts in 1994/95 and was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sparks/Propaganda\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
