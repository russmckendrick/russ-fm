      "biography": "Neil Percival Young, OC, OM (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter who is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of his generation.\nYoung began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and later joined Crosby, Stills & Nash as a fourth member in 1969. He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/DéjÃ  Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he retains Canadian citizenship, having no desire to relinquish it. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.",

      "editorial_notes": "One way to hear <i>Harvest Moon</i> is as an echo of 1972’s <i>Harvest</i>—a leap made easier by the fact that many of the same musicians played on both. But <i>Harvest</i> was made by a recently divorced 26-year-old still negotiating his creative path, and <i>Harvest Moon</i> by a multiplatinum legend who’d secured the privilege of doing more or less whatever he wanted. The same person, maybe, but separated by a Rubicon of experience.\n\nSo, while the feel of the albums is similar—gentle, plaintive, romantic—the experience is different: one, a catalogue of romance according to youth, and the other according to the reflections of middle age. The poignancy isn’t just in the latter album’s tenderness—the string sections, the country lilt, the pedal steel guitar—but in the way that Young slips between past and present: how a memory of then becomes a vision of now (“Unknown Legend”), how circular time stirs feelings we think we’ve forgotten (“Harvest Moon”).\n\nThe effect is like looking at a hologram, or a trick image that changes when you tilt the card back and forth: The object is fixed, but what you see in it flickers—and both feel equally real. The album’s most touching moment is on “Old King”, where, in the course of eulogising a beloved dog, Young mentions having kicked him when he was bad: a moment of violence neutralised by time and made strangely beautiful by the fact that Young knows it won’t ever happen again.\n\nThe connection to <i>Harvest</i> is explicit, but the album also fits in a set of what you could call Gentle Neil: <i>Comes a Time</i>, <i>Old Ways</i>, <i>Prairie Wind</i>, <i>Homegrown</i>. At the time, Young was coming off some of the noisiest, most radical shows of Crazy Horse’s career (captured on <i>Weld</i>) and had been recast as the progenitor of a generation of underground bands like Nirvana and Sonic Youth—a distinction you couldn’t quite give to David Crosby, all due respect. It must’ve been nice, being on the edge of 50 and lionised by people half your age. But, being Neil Young, he did what Neil Young does: change, again.",
