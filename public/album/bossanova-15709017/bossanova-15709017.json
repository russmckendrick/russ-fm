      "biography": "Pixies are an American alternative rock band which formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States in 1986. The band consists of Charles (Black Francis) Thompson IV (vocals, guitar; also known as ''Frank Black''), Joey Santiago (lead guitar),   David Lovering (drums) and Emma Richardson (bass, vocals). Until 2013, the band also featured  Kim Deal on bass and vocals. From 2016 until 2024 the band also featured Paz Lechantin on bass and vocals.   The band officially split in 1993  and reunited in 2004. They went on hiatus in 2007, with each band member pursuing projects of their own, only to reunite in 2009, with the announcement of a new tour commencing in Europe that summer.\n\nAlthough quite popular on alternative rock radio in the United States due to heavy airplay of the singles \"Monkey Gone to Heaven\" and \"Here Comes Your Man\", they were never widely popular there, but found success in Europe, especially in the UK (where they managed three top 40 singles \"Velouria\", \"Planet of Sound\" and a re-release of \"Debaser\") and Belgium and the Netherlands, where they were heavily broadcasted by alternative public radio. \n\nThe band's style of alternative rock music is heavily influenced by punk and surf rock, and while highly melodic, is capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer and has a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He has typically written cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as UFOs and surrealism. References to mental instability, violent Biblical imagery, and physical injury feature in many of the band's songs.\n\nThe group is frequently posited as the immediate forebear of the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain's acknowledgement of the debt Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies' legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise.\n\nIn 1993, during an interview with BBC Radio 5, Black Francis announced that the band had split - something he had not told his bandmates. After the interview, he called Santiago, who in turn faxed Deal and Lovering the news the next morning. After the split, Black Francis inverted his stage name to Frank Black and embarked on a successful solo career, while Deal resumed her role in The Breeders with her identical twin sister Kelley. In 2004, the band reunited for a tour - documented in the film loudQUIETloud - and released a new single, \"Bam Thwok\" that summer. In 2007, Black Francis (now going by that name again) stated in an interview that the reunion was \"done\" even though the members remain in good terms with each other. In later interviews however, he began to mention that he might be willing to record another Pixies album. Nonetheless, Francis has returned to his solo career and Deal to the Breeders, both of which released albums and toured in 2008. Lovering and Santiago, meanwhile, set up their own project, a band called Everybody.\n\nIn order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Doolittle, Pixies launched a tour in October 2009, on which they perform all the album's songs and B-sides. In the autumn of 2011 the \"Lost Cities\" tour continued the \"Doolittle Tour\" as they played many venues for the first time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pixies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "Heading into <i>Bossanova</i>, the Pixies were at an impasse. If 1988’s <i>Surfer Rosa</i> had made the band underground heroes, the following year’s <i>Doolittle</i> had landed them somewhere between real popularity and mainstream appeal two years later. (Interviewed for <i>People</i> magazine in 1989, a sign of the times in and of itself, Black Francis said he no longer had to worry about paying for a movie ticket but that his favourite place to write was still the bathroom.) They were touring a lot and fighting like it, too. Frustrated by her voice in the band (or lack thereof), bassist Kim Deal formed the Breeders—an equally great band—and for a little while, the Pixies were on pause.<br />\nCompared to <i>Doolittle</i>, 1990’s <i>Bossanova</i> was superficially slight: The sound was smoother, the melodies sweeter, the band’s weird gothic heat put on ice. Black Francis’ religious preoccupations—Bathsheba and Uriah on “Dead”, Samson and Delilah on “Gouge Away”, the original sin of “Hey” and the four horsemen of “Wave of Mutilation”—were fragmented into images that were both simpler and more mysterious: a girl on the beach (“Ana”), an animal in the distance (“Havalina”), the desert sky lit by a descending UFO (“The Happening”). But in the album’s spacey, offhand approach was a sense of discovery that made <i>Bossanova</i> stand out not just in the band’s catalogue, but in underground rock generally. They’d never drawn so obviously on older music—from the surf rock of “Cecilia Ann” to the doo-wop of “Velouria” and blues of “Down to the Well”. And instead of looking back on the past, the band seemed to be standing inside it. Pretty girls, weird animals, outer space: These were kids’ songs, crackling with the dislocated awe that being a kid entails. With the release of Nirvana’s <i>Nevermind</i> a year later, the Pixies were effectively recast as forefathers to a new form of rock music—an honorific due in no small part to how often Kurt Cobain talked up <i>Surfer Rosa</i>. Here, you hear how things could have gone differently. The stories weren’t biblical anymore, but <i>Bossanova</i> was nothing if not a revelation.",

The album's sound, inspired by surf and space rock, complements its lyrical focus on outer space, which references subjects such as aliens and unidentified flying objects.\n\nBecause of 4AD's independent status, major label Elektra Records handled distribution in the United States; however, Bossanova only reached #70 on the Billboard 200. It charted significantly higher in the United Kingdom, reaching #3 in the Albums Chart.

      "wiki_content": "Bossanova is the third album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in August 1990 on the English independent record label 4AD. All of Bossanova's original material was written by the band's frontman Black Francis; it marked the point where his artistic control over the band became absolute. The album's sound, inspired by surf and space rock, complements its lyrical focus on outer space, which references subjects such as aliens and unidentified flying objects.\n\nBecause of 4AD's independent status, major label Elektra Records handled distribution in the United States; however, Bossanova only reached #70 on the Billboard 200. It charted significantly higher in the United Kingdom, reaching #3 in the Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Bossanova, Velouria and Dig for Fire both charted highly on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pixies/Bossanova\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
