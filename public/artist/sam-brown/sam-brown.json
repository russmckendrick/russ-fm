  "biography": "Sam Brown (born 7 October 1964, in Stratford, London, UK) is an English Jazz and R&B singer.\n\nHer father was pop guitarist Joe Brown and her mother was a popular backing singer Vicki Brown.  She appeared as singer with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, and in 1977 she was a backing singer on the Small Faces' final album In the Shade. Later, together with her mother as The Lillettes, she was a backing singer on Steve Marriott's Packet of Three: Live.\n\nShe recorded her debut album Stop! with her guitarist brother Pete Brown as producer. In 1988  the single \"Stop\" was released and almost a year later it topped the charts in Holland and Germany, reached number four in the U.K. charts; the album did likewise and went on to sell 2.5 million worldwide. Despite more chart singles, the follow-up April Moon (1990) managed only something over half a million sales, and sales of her third album 43 Minutes (1993) were also poor. Her independently-released album Box (1997) made 17,000-odd sales.\n\nShe spent some time as featured vocalist with Jools Holland & His Rhythm & Blues Orchestra, and was a backing singer on Pink Floyd's Division Bell tour in 1994.  In 2000 the album Reboot was released. In April 2003 the BBC broadcast an interview with her, playing her ukulele and singing \"Kiss of Love\". Her most recent releases (2007) are Of the Moment and an EP of acoustic arrangements, Ukulele and Voice, recorded with her father.\n\nSome new tracks have also been made available for listening on her Myspace profile, and her official fan club site [url=[officialsite]http://www.onecandle.co.uk]One Candle offers two demo tracks of the album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sam+Brown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
