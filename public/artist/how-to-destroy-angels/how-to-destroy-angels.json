Rob Sheridan  is the group's art director. The band is named after How to Destroy Angels, the first single by Coil.  \n\nThe band's first release was a self-titled EP, released on June 1, 2010. The band released a track from the album, \"A Drowning\", as a digital single, and a second song, \"The Space in Between\", debuted as a video on Pitchfork on May 14, 2010. A third track, \"The Believers\", was made available through Wired magazine's iPad application, along with a dissection and analysis of the song, and through a free digital download from the official website. \"The Believers\" is also featured on the soundtrack of the 2011 film Limitless.\n\nThe band recorded a cover of the Bryan Ferry song \"Is Your Love Strong Enough?,\" which was released December 9, 2011 on the soundtrack for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nOn 21 September 2012, Trent Reznor posted an update on the band's Facebook page confirming new activity.
