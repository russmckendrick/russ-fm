      "biography": "The Buena Vista Social Club was a members club in Havana, Cuba that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 50 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.\nThe recording, named Buena Vista Social Club after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in Carnegie Hall, New York City for a documentary that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film, also called Buena Vista Social Club, was released to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards.\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, laúd player Barbarito Torres and trombonist and conductor Jesus \"Aguaje\" Ramos currently tour worldwide, to popular acclaim, with new members such as the singer Carlos Calunga, virtuoso pianist Rolando Luna and occasionally the solo singer Omara Portuondo, as part of a 13 member band called Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club.",

            "content": "Buena Vista Social Club is a studio album by Buena Vista Social Club, an ensemble of Cuban musicians directed by Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder. Produced by Cooder, it was recorded at Havana's EGREM studios in March 1996 and released on September 16, 1997, through World Circuit internationally and Nonesuch Records in the United States. It is the only standard studio album exclusively credited to the Buena Vista Social Club.\n\nBuena Vista Social Club was recorded in parallel with A toda Cuba le gusta by the Afro-Cuban All Stars, a similar project also promoted by World Circuit executive Nick Gold and featuring largely the same lineup. In contrast to A toda Cuba le gusta, which was conceived as a revival of the son conjunto, Buena Vista Social Club was meant to bring back the traditional trova and filin, a mellower take on the Cuban son and bolero, as well as the danzón.\n\nThe album was a critical and commercial success. Its release was followed by a short concert tour in Amsterdam and New York's Carnegie Hall in 1998. Footage from these dates, as well as from the recording sessions in Havana, was shown in the 1999 documentary Buena Vista Social Club directed by Wim Wenders. In 2022, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally historically or aesthetically significant\". In the same year it was recognized by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling world music album.\n\nBackground\nIn 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder was invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which two African highlife musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. When Cooder arrived (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it was found that the musicians from Africa had not received their visas and were unable to come. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians instead. Cuban musicians already involved in the African collaboration project included bassist Orlando \"Cachaito\" López, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos González, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea, pianist Rubén González, trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.\n\nCooder, Gold and de Marcos organized a large group of performers (twenty are credited) and arranged recording sessions at Havana's EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s. Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that \"musicians understand each other through means other than speaking\".\n\nRecording\nThe album contained fourteen tracks and was recorded in six days. It opened with \"Chan Chan\" written by Compay Segundo, a four-chord son (Dm, F, Gm, A7) that was to become what Cooder described as \"the Buena Vista's calling card\"; and ending with a rendition of \"La bayamesa\", a traditional Cuban patriotic song (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name). The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release Introducing...Rubén González which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist. Among the songs left off the album were the classic bolero-son \"Lágrimas negras\", which was deemed too popular for inclusion, and Compay Segundo's \"Macusa\". Both songs were later released on the compilation Lost and Found.\n\nSongs\nThe majority of the album comprised standards of the trova and filin repertoire, namely sones, guajiras and boleros typically played by small guitar-led ensembles. A foremost example of the son tradition on the album was \"Chan Chan\", the group's signature tune and the album opener. Written in the 1980s, it was one of Compay Segundo's most famous songs and one he had recorded several times, most notably with Eliades Ochoa and his Cuarteto Patria. The same formula was followed in this recording, with Ochoa singing lead and Segundo on second voice (as his artist name indicated). The song's lyrics depicted a rural scene with two characters, Juanita and Chan Chan. \"Chan Chan\" was followed by \"De camino a la vereda\", another son, written and sung by Ibrahim Ferrer.\n\nAnother example of the son cubano was Sergio González Siaba's \"El cuarto de Tula\", sung by Eliades Ochoa, with Ibrahim Ferrer and Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea joining Ochoa in an extended descarga (jam) section improvising lyrics. Barbarito Torres played a frenetic laúd solo towards the end of the track. Timbales were played by 13-year-old Yulién Oviedo Sánchez. The song was featured in the 2001 film Training Day. \"Candela\" was another classic son, composed by Faustino Oramas \"El Guayabero\". Its lyrics, rich with sexual innuendo, were sung by Ibrahim Ferrer, who improvised vocal lines throughout the track, and the whole ensemble performed an extended descarga.\n\nOf the many boleros featured in the album, Isolina Carrillo's \"Dos gardenias\" was perhaps the most famous, sung here by Ibrahim Ferrer. Carrillo wrote the song in 1945 and it became a huge success in Cuba and abroad. The song was chosen for the album after Cooder heard Ferrer and Rubén González improvising the melody before a recording session. Ferrer had learned the song while playing with Cuban bandleader Beny Moré. Another bolero, \"¿Y tú qué has hecho?\" was written by Eusebio Delfín in the 1920s and featured Compay Segundo on tres and vocals. Segundo was traditionally a \"second voice\" singer providing a baritone counterpoint harmony. On this recording he multitracked both voices. The song also featured a duet between Segundo on tres and Ry Cooder on guitar. \"Veinte años\", also a bolero, was sung by the only female vocalist in the ensemble, Omara Portuondo, with Segundo on second vocals. It was recorded in one take after Omara had finished her own recording sessions at EGREM studios and was preparing to fly to Vietnam. Other boleros included were Rafael Ortiz's \"Amor de loca juventud\", Eliseo Silveira's \"Orgullecida\" (both sung by Compay Segundo) and Electo Rosell's \"Murmullo\" (sung by Ibrahim Ferrer, who used to be the lead vocalist in Rosell's ensemble Orquesta Chepín-Chovén).\n\n\"El carretero\", a guajira (country lament), was sung by Eliades Ochoa with the full ensemble providing additional instruments and backing vocals. \"La bayamesa\", a famous criolla by Sindo Garay, was the album closer with Puntillita, Compay Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer on vocals.\n\nTwo tracks were included from the Cuban danzón repertoire, \"Pueblo Nuevo\" and \"Buena Vista Social Club\", both dedicated to locations in Havana. They were originally recorded by Arcaño y sus Maravillas and were composed by bass player Cachao (although \"Buena Vista Social Club\" has been wrongly attributed to his brother Orestes López in the liner notes and by Cooder). The title track, highlighting the piano work of Rubén González, was recorded after Cooder heard González improvising around the tune's musical theme before a day's recording session. After playing the tune, González explained to Cooder the history of the social club and that the song was the club's \"mascot tune\". When searching for a name for the overall project, manager Nick Gold chose the song's title. \nAccording to Cooder:\n\"It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon. It felt like a club, so let's call it that. That's what gave it a handle.\"\n\nReception\nBuena Vista Social Club earned considerable critical praise from music writers and publications. In 2003, the album was ranked number 260 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, one of only two albums on the list to be produced in a non-English speaking country. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. As of 2020, the album had sold over 8 million copies.\n\nThe album was awarded the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album and Tropical/Salsa Album of the Year by a Group at the 1998 Billboard Latin Music Awards.\n\nIn 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry.\n\nIn 2024, it was ranked in eleventh position on the “Los 600 de Latinoamérica” list compiled by a collective of music journalists from several countries of the Americas, curating the top 600 Latin American albums from 1920-2022.\n\nTrack listing\n1.\t\"Chan Chan\"\n2.\t\"De camino a la vereda\" \t\n3.\t\"El cuarto de Tula\"\t\t\n4.\t\"Pueblo Nuevo\" \t\n5.\t\"Dos gardenias\" \n6.\t\"¿Y tú qué has hecho?\"\t \t\n7.\t\"Veinte años\"  \t\n8.\t\"El carretero\" \t\n9.\t\"Candela\" \n10.\t\"Amor de loca juventud\" \t\n11.\t\"Orgullecida\" \t\n12.\t\"Murmullo\"\n13.\t\"Buena Vista Social Club\"\t\n14.\t\"La bayamesa\"\t\n\nMusicians\nEliades Ochoa – vocals (1, 3, 8, 9), guitar (1, 3, 8, 9, 11)\nCompay Segundo – backing vocals (1), congas (1), guitar (2, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14), vocals (6, 7, 10, 11, 14)\nIbrahim Ferrer – backing vocals (1, 8), vocals (2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 14), conga (4), clave (6, 13), bongos (10)\nRy Cooder – guitars (1–7, 11–13), mbira (2, 8), oud (8), bolon (8), floor slide (8), percussion (8), acoustic slide guitar (9), electric slide guitar (9), slide guitar (10)\nManuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal – trumpet (1–5, 9, 11)\nOrlando \"Cachaito\" López – bass (1–9, 11–14)\nCarlos Gonzáles – bongos (1, 3, 9), cowbell (3, 9)\nAlberto Valdés – maracas (1–9, 12, 13), backing vocals (2), chorus vocals (3, 9)\nJoachim Cooder – udu drum (1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13), dumbek (2, 3, 6, 7, 9–11), conga (3), drums (11)\nBarbarito Torres – laoud (2, 3, 11)\nManuel Licea – backing vocals (2), vocals (3, 14), chorus vocals (9), congas (13)\nJuan de Marcos González – backing vocals (2, 8), conductor (3, 9), güiro (8), chorus vocals (9)\nLuis Barzaga – backing vocals (2), chorus vocals (3, 9)\nJulienne Oviedo Sánchez – timbales (3)\nRubén González (pianist) – piano (4, 5, 6, 11–14)\nLázaro Villa – güiro (4, 13), congas (5, 12)\nOmara Portuondo – vocals (7)\nJulio Alberto Fernández – vocals (10), maracas (10)\nBenito Suárez Magana – guitar (10)\nSalvador Repilado Labrada – bass (10)\n\nChart performance\nBuena Vista Social Club achieved considerable sales in Europe, reaching the Top 10 in several countries, including Germany where it topped the charts, as well as the US, where it reached number 80 on the Billboard 200.

      "wiki_content": "Buena Vista Social Club is a studio album by Buena Vista Social Club, an ensemble of Cuban musicians directed by Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder. Produced by Cooder, it was recorded at Havana's EGREM studios in March 1996 and released on September 16, 1997, through World Circuit internationally and Nonesuch Records in the United States. It is the only standard studio album exclusively credited to the Buena Vista Social Club.\n\nBuena Vista Social Club was recorded in parallel with A toda Cuba le gusta by the Afro-Cuban All Stars, a similar project also promoted by World Circuit executive Nick Gold and featuring largely the same lineup. In contrast to A toda Cuba le gusta, which was conceived as a revival of the son conjunto, Buena Vista Social Club was meant to bring back the traditional trova and filin, a mellower take on the Cuban son and bolero, as well as the danzón.\n\nThe album was a critical and commercial success. Its release was followed by a short concert tour in Amsterdam and New York's Carnegie Hall in 1998. Footage from these dates, as well as from the recording sessions in Havana, was shown in the 1999 documentary Buena Vista Social Club directed by Wim Wenders. In 2022, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally historically or aesthetically significant\". In the same year it was recognized by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling world music album.\n\nBackground\nIn 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder was invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which two African highlife musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. When Cooder arrived (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it was found that the musicians from Africa had not received their visas and were unable to come. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians instead. Cuban musicians already involved in the African collaboration project included bassist Orlando \"Cachaito\" López, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos González, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea, pianist Rubén González, trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.\n\nCooder, Gold and de Marcos organized a large group of performers (twenty are credited) and arranged recording sessions at Havana's EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s. Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that \"musicians understand each other through means other than speaking\".\n\nRecording\nThe album contained fourteen tracks and was recorded in six days. It opened with \"Chan Chan\" written by Compay Segundo, a four-chord son (Dm, F, Gm, A7) that was to become what Cooder described as \"the Buena Vista's calling card\"; and ending with a rendition of \"La bayamesa\", a traditional Cuban patriotic song (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name). The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release Introducing...Rubén González which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist. Among the songs left off the album were the classic bolero-son \"Lágrimas negras\", which was deemed too popular for inclusion, and Compay Segundo's \"Macusa\". Both songs were later released on the compilation Lost and Found.\n\nSongs\nThe majority of the album comprised standards of the trova and filin repertoire, namely sones, guajiras and boleros typically played by small guitar-led ensembles. A foremost example of the son tradition on the album was \"Chan Chan\", the group's signature tune and the album opener. Written in the 1980s, it was one of Compay Segundo's most famous songs and one he had recorded several times, most notably with Eliades Ochoa and his Cuarteto Patria.

The song's lyrics depicted a rural scene with two characters, Juanita and Chan Chan. \"Chan Chan\" was followed by \"De camino a la vereda\", another son, written and sung by Ibrahim Ferrer.\n\nAnother example of the son cubano was Sergio González Siaba's \"El cuarto de Tula\", sung by Eliades Ochoa, with Ibrahim Ferrer and Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea joining Ochoa in an extended descarga (jam) section improvising lyrics. Barbarito Torres played a frenetic laúd solo towards the end of the track. Timbales were played by 13-year-old Yulién Oviedo Sánchez.
