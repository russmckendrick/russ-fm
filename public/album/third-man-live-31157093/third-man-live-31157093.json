      "biography": "Jack White (born John Anthony Gillis; July 9, 1975) is an American musician, singer, somgwriter and record producer. He is known as the lead singer and guitarist of The White Stripes, and has had success in other bands and as a solo artist. On April 24, 2012, White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss. His second studio album, Lazaretto, was released on June 10, 2014. Both received wide commercial and critical acclaim.\n\nAfter moonlighting in several underground Detroit bands as a drummer, White founded The White Stripes with fellow Detroit native—and then wife—Meg White in 1997. Their 2001 breakthrough album, White Blood Cells, brought them international fame with the hit single and accompanying music video, \"Fell in Love with a Girl\". This recognition provided White opportunities to collaborate with famous artists, including Loretta Lynn and Bob Dylan. In 2006, White founded The Raconteurs with Brendan Benson, and in 2009 founded The Dead Weather with Alison Mosshart of The Kills.\n\nWhite has enjoyed consistent critical and popular success, and is widely credited as one of the key artists in the garage rock revival of the 2000s. He has won eight Grammy Awards, and both of his solo albums have reached number one on the Billboard charts. Rolling Stone ranked him number 70 on its 2010 list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". David Fricke's 2011 list ranked him at number 17. White has an extensive collection of guitars and other instruments, and has a preference for vintage items that often have connections to famous blues artists. He is a vocal advocate for analog technology and recording techniques, and he is a board member of the Library of Congress' National Recording Preservation Foundation. His record label and studio Third Man Records releases vinyl recordings of his own work, as well as that of other artists and local school children. His latest album holds the record for most first-week vinyl sales since 1991.\n\nWhite values his privacy and has been known to create misdirection about his personal life; he has been called \"eccentric.\" He and Meg divorced in 2000. He married the model and singer Karen Elson in 2005. They divorced in 2013. Together, they have a son and daughter. He currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nJohn Anthony Gillis was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest of ten children—and the seventh son—of Teresa (née Bandyk) and Gorman M. Gillis. His mother's family was Polish, while his father was of Scottish-Canadian descent. He was raised a Catholic, and his father and mother both worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit (as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively). Gillis became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit.\n\nGillis' early musical influences were inherited from his older brothers, and he learned to play the instruments they abandoned; he began playing the drums in the first grade after finding a kit in the attic. As a child, he was a fan of classical music, but in elementary school, he began listening to the Doors, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. As a \"shorthaired  with braces,\" Gillis began listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes, with Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues guitarists. He has said in interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' in your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. As a drummer, his heroes include Gene Krupa, Stewart Copeland, and Crow Smith from Flat Duo Jets.\n\nIn 2005 on 60 Minutes, he told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school.' I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" Instead, he got accepted into the famed Cass Technical High School as a business major, and played the drums and trombone in the band. At 15, he began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. He credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music as they worked together in the shop. Muldoon goaded his young apprentice into forming a band: \"He played drums\", Gillis thought. \"Well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers.\n\nAs a senior in high school, he met Megan White at the Memphis Smoke restaurant where she worked, and they frequented the coffee shops, local music venues, and record stores of the area. After a courtship, they got married on September 21, 1996. In a reversal of tradition, he took her last name.\n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship, he started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black—including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, he claims it was unprofitable due to his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture.",

J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. renown and his long time friend Dave Sweetapple were interested in forming a hard rock band. They found willing and able conspirators in Kyle Thomas and Asa Irons, members of New England avant-folk outfit Feathers, as well as King Tuff and Happy Birthday. On their eponymous debut album, this line-up mounts a mighty sonic tumult that harkens back to classic heavy metal sound of early 70’s outfits while still sounding modern in its assault (and without falling into the ubiquitous “Stoner Rock” pigeonhole).",

      "biography": "Dinosaur Jr. is an American alternative rock band formed in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1984. Originally called Dinosaur, prior to legal issues that forced the group to change their name, the band disbanded in 1997 until reuniting in 2005. Guitarist J Mascis, bassist Lou Barlow, and drummer Murph were the band's founding and current members; Mascis has been the group's sole continuous member.\nTheir distinct guitar sound, characterized by high gain, extensive use of feedback and distortion, and frontman J Mascis's melodic guitar solos, was highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.\nMascis and Barlow had previously played together in a hardcore punk band called Deep Wound, formed in 1982 while the pair were attending high school in western Massachusetts. After high school, they began exploring slower yet still aggressive music such as Black Sabbath, The Replacements, and Neil Young. Mascis' college friend Gerard Cosloy introduced him to bands like Dream Syndicate, which Mascis in turn showed to Barlow. Barlow explained, \"We loved speed metal...and we loved wimpy-jangly stuff\".\nDeep Wound broke up in mid-1984. Cosloy had dropped out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to focus on running his independent record label, Homestead Records, and promised Mascis that if he were to make a record Homestead would release it. Mascis wrote a number of songs by himself and showed them to Barlow, to whom he offered the bassist position. While Barlow had played guitar in Deep Wound, he accepted as he was impressed by the material Mascis was creating. Barlow said the songs \"were fucking brilliant...They were so far beyond. I was still into two-chord songs and basic stuff like 'I'm so sad.' While I was really into my own little tragedy, J was operating in this whole other panorama.\" Mascis enlisted vocalist Charlie Nakajima, also formerly of Deep Wound, and drummer Emmett Patrick Murphy, otherwise known as Murph, to complete the band. Mascis explained the concept behind the group as \"ear-bleeding country.\"\nThe band was initially named Mogo, and played their first show on University of Massachusetts Amherst campus in the first week of September 1984. Nakajima went into an anti-cop rant during the performance, and Mascis was so appalled by his behavior at the show that he disbanded the group the next day. A few days later Mascis called Barlow and Murph to form a new band without telling Nakajima; \"I was kind of too wimpy to kick him out, exactly,\" Mascis later admitted, and explained, \"Communicating with people has been a constant problem in the band.\" The trio named themselves Dinosaur, and Mascis and Barlow took over lead vocal duties.",

Original bassist Matt Lukin left the band in 1999 but briefly returned in December 2000 to complete touring obligations. Mudhoney's early releases on Sub Pop, particularly debut single \"Touch Me I'm Sick\" and the Superfuzz Bigmuff EP, were massively influential on the Seattle music scene, helping more than almost any other releases of the era to inspire the dirty, high-distortion sound that would become grunge. Mudhoney was also notable for its mixing of heavy blues rock and punk rock. Although the band has found little commercial success during its long career, which has yielded 10 studio albums, it nonetheless inspired many grunge and alternative rock musicians.",

Since the duo’s dissolution in 2011, Jack White has continued playing with form (and colour schemes), from the just-one-of-the-boys-in-the-band vibes of The Raconteurs to 2022’s sonically experimental <i>Fear of the Dawn</i> and its more restrained companion <i>Entering Heaven Alive</i>. Despite—or perhaps <i>to</i> spite—those who longed for a simpler, noisier, more monochromatic time, White tinkered away.\n\nThe rollout for <i>No Name</i>, White’s sixth solo album, was characteristically mischievous: It first appeared as a white-label LP given away at Third Man Records before being posted online without song titles, sparking an excitement that felt fresh, largely because the sound did not. Meg White is not walking through that door anytime soon, but the 13 tracks here channel the unadorned, wild-eyed ferocity of the band that made him famous more efficiently and consistently than anything he’s done since. There’s plenty of swagger from top to bottom, but most of all there’s <i>hooks</i>: big, fat, noisy guitars played in the catchiest combinations possible. \n\n“That’s How I’m Feeling” may not relieve “Seven Nation Army” of its ubiquity anytime soon, but it is a ready-made capital-A anthem with a euphoric jump-scare chorus that sticks on first listen and doesn’t get unstuck. “Bless Yourself”, “Tonight (Was a Long Time Ago)” and “Number One With a Bullet” are just as infectious, while “Bombing Out” may be the fastest, heaviest thing White has ever put out in any of his many guises. The casualness of it all is a flex—as meticulous and exacting as White can be, <i>No Name</i>’s modest arrival is a reminder of how easily he could have kept churning out earworm White Stripes songs. Good for him that he didn’t want to; good for us that he does now.",
