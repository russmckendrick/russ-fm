      "biography": "Rush were a Canadian rock band formed in 1968 in Toronto, that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their 1974 self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.\n\nRush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with Fly by Night (1975), 2112 (1976), A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984) and Counterparts (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.\n\nRush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.\n\nAs of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nRush (1974)\nFly by Night (1975)\nCaress of Steel (1975)\n2112 (1976)\nA Farewell to Kings (1977)\nHemispheres (1978)\nPermanent Waves (1980)\nMoving Pictures (1981)\nSignals (1982)\nGrace Under Pressure (1984)\nPower Windows (1985)\nHold Your Fire (1987)\nPresto (1989)\nRoll the Bones (1991)\nCounterparts (1993)\nTest for Echo (1996)\nVapor Trails (2002)\nSnakes & Arrows (2007)\nClockwork Angels (2012) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Power Windows is the eleventh studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1985 . The album was recorded at The Manor in England, Air Studios in Montserrat and at Sarm East in London.\n\nPower Windows introduced more keyboard synthesizers into the band's sound, and featured very precise drumming and guitar. Generally, short, echoey guitar \"bursts\" tend to outnumber solos as well as riffs. The result is a very open and dynamic yet somewhat spartan sound. Although some fans consider the album to be too sterile, others view this period as the pinnacle of the group's career. “The Big Money” and “Mystic Rhythms,” arguably the two most popular songs on the album, were each made into music videos featured in MTV's rotation at the time. Many fans will agree that repeated listening is key to the enjoyment of Power Windows.\n\nPower Windows' lyrics are focused primarily on various manifestations of power, be they overt (nuclear weapons) or personal (frustration at one's lack of power). For example, the song \"Manhattan Project\" explores the origins and consequences of the U.S. military's development of the atomic bomb. \"Territories\" comments on nationalism around the world. Like \"Subdivisions,\" from the album Signals, \"Middletown Dreams\" explores suburban monotony and the average person's attempts to escape it temporarily.\n\nAs a whole, Power Windows represents the peak of Rush’s “synthesizer period,” although the next release, Hold Your Fire, features a similar amount of synthesizers.\n\nBackground\nFebruary 1985, work started at Elora Sound for three weeks, in the barn with a 24 track studio. Bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson were working on songs that fitted to lyrics drummer Neil Peart wrote at a small desk there, and vice versa, Peart writing lyrics that fit songs. He was trying to write the Manhattan Project. Being based on real history, he had to research it. He also wrote rough outlines for The Big Money, Mystic Rhythms and Marathon. Lee and Lifeson sorted through jams and Lifeson’s riff tapes. Those three songs took up to a week. They then began on Middletown Dreams, again Marathon, and then Grand Designs.\n\nIn March, Peart was going through tapes to the five new songs in a Miami hotel room, getting ready for the warm up tour gig in Lakeland, Florida. They met up with engineer James \"Jimbo\" Barton, recommended by producer Peter Collins. Later at Elora, the lyrics Peart was formerly struggling with, Territories and Manhattan Project, began to fall together. Peart was also working on lyrics to a ballad called Emotion Detector. The lyrics seemed to work perfectly with the music they were jamming on at the time. Territories was also arranged, and they had a tape of seven songs. They had trouble with Manhattan Project, but Collins contributed ideas to this and other songs.\n\nApril, at The Manor Studio in England, basic tracks were recorded more quickly than usual, in the span of a few weeks, to capture more spontaneous performances ready for overdubs. Andy Richards was brought in to provide extra keyboard programming and performances. The drum tech was sent to London to pick up African and Indian drums for use on Mystic Rhythms, and bongos were also used on Territories.\n\nIn May, Lifeson began guitar overdubs at Air Studios in Montserrat. Next in June, at Sarm East studios London, he began on guitar solos, and Lee did vocals. They moved to a townhouse in July for mixing, a decision on the track listing, and the artwork, credits, and photos. Strings were recorded for the album by a 30 piece orchestra in Studio 1 at Abbey Road Studios in August. A twenty five piece choir was also recorded at Angel Studios for the ending of Marathon. September, Lee oversaw the mastering in New York, and proofs were approved for the album cover.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll music by Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee and lyrics by Neil Peart.\n\n\nSide one\n\"The Big Money\" – 5:35 \n\"Grand Designs\" – 5:06 \n\"Manhattan Project\" – 5:05 \n\"Marathon\" – 6:09 \n\nSide two\n\"Territories\" – 6:19 \n\"Middletown Dreams\" – 5:15 \n\"Emotion Detector\" – 5:10 \n\"Mystic Rhythms\" – 5:53 \n\nPersonnel\nGeddy Lee - bass guitar, synthesizers, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - electric and acoustic guitars \nNeil Peart - drums, percussion \nAndy Richards - additional keyboards \nAnne Dudley - strings arrangement \nAndrew Jackman - conductor, arrangements \nJim Barton - engineer \nHugh Syme - artwork, cover design \nAlbum Trivia\nThe intro to \"Mystic Rhythms\" was used as the theme music for a news magazine show, \"1986\", which aired on the NBC network (US) and was hosted by Connie Chung. \nThe album art continues Rush's trend of playing on words. The cover shows television sets, which are a type of \"power window\". The subject is using a remote control to operate his sash window. Another illustration of the album shows the front cover's subject looking through another type of 'power window', a set of binoculars. \nThe televisions shown on the cover are a 1949 General Electric Bakelite \"Locomotive\" and two 1958 Predictas  \nIn December 2007 demo recordings of the entire Power Windows album were uploaded onto a Rush Internet forum and are currently being spread and shared by fans. The quality of the demos varies although many appear distorted or \"warped.\" These demo versions of the songs are almost identical in all ways to the finished tracks. \nIn addition to using a Wal bass, Geddy Lee uses a Roland Jupiter 8, PPG Wave 2.3, and a Yamaha DX-7 synthesizer on the album. \n\n Remaster Details\nAlthough the original recording had a SPARS Code of DDD and was considered to be of good quality, a remaster was issued in 1997. The remaster follows the trend of newer albums, as it is considerably louder.\n\nThe tray has a picture of three fingerprints, light blue, pink, and lime green (left to right) with THE RUSH REMASTERS printed in all caps just to the left. All remasters from Moving Pictures through to A Show of Hands are like this.
