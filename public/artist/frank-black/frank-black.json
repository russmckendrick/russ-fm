  "biography": "Frank Black is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV (born April 6, 1965). After releasing three albums with this name, he formed the band Frank Black and the Catholics. He returned to using the name Black Francis, the name he uses as vocalist of the Pixies, in 2007.\n\nLead songwriter and vocalist of the now reunited Pixies, Frank Black adopted a reversal of his former alias, Black Francis, and embarked on his solo career after the 1992 breakup of Pixies. He released his debut self-titled album, Frank Black in 1993. It contains his biggest rock radio hit, Los Angeles (#4 US Modern Rock). A year later came the critically acclaimed Teenager of the Year. \n\nFrank Black's solo career covers a much more diverse range of styles and genres compared to his time with The Pixies. His works have feature a much more melodic touch, yet his lyrics are still often spiced with his quirky and inventive touch.\n\nFrank Black regularly posts and responds to questions on the forums of his official fan site, frankblack.net, under the alias \"frnck blck\".\n\nHe began recording and touring as Black Francis in 2007, with the album Bluefinger, an album about the late Dutch musician and painter Herman Brood, and the mini album Svn Fngrs in 2008.  On this tour he abandoned encores in favour of precores; a free mini gig at a public location earlier in the day.  The gigs proper featured only current songs, the precores being more flexible. \n\nBlack Francis released NonStopErotik in March 2010.\n\nThe Pixies, minus original bassist Kim Deal, reunited for a United States and world tour in 2014 and have subsequently released three additional studio albums: Indie Cindy (2014), Head Carrier (2016) and Beneath the Eyrie (2019). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Black\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
