      "biography": "Huey Lewis and the News is an American rock band based in San Francisco, California. They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually scoring a total of 19 top-ten singles across the Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary and Mainstream Rock charts. Their greatest success was in the 1980s with the number-one album, Sports, coupled with a series of highly successful MTV videos. Their worldwide fame expanded when the song \"The Power of Love\" was featured as a key track in the film Back to the Future, became a number-one hit, and nominated for an Academy Award. The News combined a rock (and sometimes, a \"blues-rock\") backing with soul and doo-wop-influenced harmony vocals and Lewis' voice.\nIn 1972, singer/harmonica player Huey Lewis and keyboardist Sean Hopper joined the Bay Area jazz-funk band Clover. Clover recorded several albums in the 1970s, and in the middle of the decade transplanted themselves to England to become part of the UK pub rock scene for a time. Without Lewis (but with Hopper), they eventually became the original backing band for Elvis Costello's first album My Aim Is True. Lewis also worked with Irish band Thin Lizzy, contributing harmonica to the song \"Baby Drives Me Crazy,\" recorded onstage for the Live and Dangerous album. Lizzy bassist/vocalist Phil Lynott introduces Lewis by name during the song. The band returned to the Bay Area by the end of the 1970s.\nClover's main competition in the Bay Area jazz-funk scene was a band called Soundhole, whose members included drummer Bill Gibson, saxophonist/guitarist Johnny Colla, and bassist Mario Cipollina (younger brother of John Cipollina). Like Clover, Soundhole had spent time backing a famous singer, Van Morrison. After getting a singles contract from Phonogram Records in 1978, Huey Lewis united his former bandmate and three of his former rivals to form a new group, Huey Lewis & The American Express. In 1979 they recorded and released a single, \"Exo-Disco\" (a disco version of the theme from the film Exodus), that was largely ignored. The B-side of this record, \"Kick Back\", was a song that had previously been performed live by Lewis and his former band, Clover. In 1979, the band wooed guitarist Chris Hayes and moved to Chrysalis Records. After the credit card organization American Express complained, in January 1980 they changed their name to Huey Lewis and the News.\nLater in 1980, the band issued their first studio album, a self-titled LP, Huey Lewis and the News. It went largely unnoticed. In 1982, the band released their second studio album, the self-produced Picture This. The album turned gold, fueled by the breakout success of the hit single \"Do You Believe in Love\", written by former Clover producer Mutt Lange. Largely because of the single, the album remained on the Billboard 200 album chart for 35 weeks and peaked at No. 13. The follow-up singles from Picture This, \"Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do\" and \"Workin' for a Livin'\", followed with limited success, though the video for \"Workin' for a Livin'\" received considerable airplay on MTV and HBO's Video Jukebox.\nDue to record label delays on the release of their third studio album, Sports, Huey Lewis and the News was back to square one in late 1983, touring small clubs in a bus to promote the record (eventually known as the \"Workin' for a Livin'\" tour). The new album initially hit No. 6 in the U.S. when first released. However, Sports slowly became a number-one hit in 1984 and multi-platinum success in 1985, thanks to the band's frequent touring and a series of videos that received heavy MTV airplay. Four singles from the album reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100: \"Heart and Soul\" reached No. 8, while \"I Want a New Drug,\" \"The Heart of Rock & Roll,\" and \"If This Is It\" all reached No. 6. The album has sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone.\nTheir song \"The Power of Love\" was a number-one U.S. hit and featured in the 1985 film Back to the Future, for which they also recorded the song, \"Back in Time\". Lewis has a cameo appearance in the film as a faculty member who rejects Marty McFly's band's audition for the school's \"Battle of the Bands\" contest. As an inside joke, the piece the band plays is an instrumental heavy metal version of \"The Power of Love\" (Lewis's response: \"Sorry, fellas ... I'm afraid you're just too darn loud\"). \"The Power of Love\" was nominated for an Academy Award.\nFollowing the success of \"The Power of Love\" and Back to the Future, Huey Lewis and the News released their fourth studio album, Fore! in 1986. Fore! followed the success of Sports and reached number-one on the Billboard 200. The album spawned the number-one singles, \"Stuck with You\" and \"Jacob's Ladder\" as well as the mainstream rock hit \"Hip to Be Square\". In all, the album had five top-ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum.\nThe band continued to tour throughout 1987, and released Small World in 1988. After two hit, multi-platinum albums, Small World was considered a commercial disappointment, peaking at No. 11 and only going platinum. The album, which was more jazz and less rock than their previous albums, had one top ten single, \"Perfect World\", which reached No. 3 on the pop chart. The album was voted by Rolling Stone Magazine as the worst album of 1988.\nAt the end of the Small World tour in 1989, the band took a break from recording and heavy touring and parted ways with Chrysalis Records. In 1991, they released Hard at Play on the EMI label, which went back to the R&B/rock sound of their earlier albums, and released the hit singles, \"Couple Days Off\" (No. 11) and \"It Hit Me Like a Hammer\" (No. 21). The album was certified Gold (eventually hitting the one million sales mark) and the band headlined another world tour in support of the release, which would be their last album of new material for a decade.\nThe band once again changed labels, this time signing with Elektra Records, releasing a cover album in 1994 called Four Chords & Several Years Ago featuring doo-wop and rock songs from the 1950s and 1960s. This was the last album released with bassist Mario Cipollina, who left the band after the Four Chords & Several Years Ago world tour ended. The album charted on the Billboard 200 and had two hits on adult contemporary radio. In early 1997, the band released their first greatest hits album, Time Flies, which focused primarily on the releases from Picture This, Sports, and Fore!, and included four new tracks.",

      "editorial_notes": "“When I listen to the <i>Sports</i> record now, I realise it’s a record of its time,” Huey Lewis told Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig on an episode of Apple Music’s Time Crisis. “It’s a collection of singles—that’s what was going on. That’s the only way you could exist.” It is tempting to say that if you looked up 1983 in the dictionary, you would find the cover of Huey Lewis & The News’ third album <i>Sports</i>, but that doesn’t exactly track. (Why would a year be listed in the dictionary?) Yet the absolutely hit-laden album is such a precise time capsule of the moment when the ’80s became “the ’80s” that later generations may know it best as a ubiquitous <i>American Psycho</i> reference. \n\nLewis’ proudly un-hip taste (“I come from R&B, my favourite singer’s Johnny Taylor,” he says) proved to be wise counter-programming coming out of the ’70s as a new form of radio-friendly rock was taking shape. For all the album’s beer-commercial trappings, right down to the sports-bar cover art, its architect was the thirtysomething son of first-wave Marin County hippies whose idea of counterculture rebellion was to start a band with a lead saxophonist. \n\nLewis had been playing harmonica in the Bay Area band Clover for much of the ’70s—even on Thin Lizzy’s <i>Live and Dangerous</i>—and by the time he formed his own band, he knew how to play the game: “We’re recording in ’81, ’82—there’s only one avenue to success and that’s radio,” he says. “That’s where you had to be to exist. There was no other way of making a living in the music business. We aimed every song at radio and [made] each one different—one kind of R&B-ish, one kind of a rock tune, one kind of a ballad—because we didn’t know which one was going to hit or what.”\n\nWith two-thirds of its tracklist essentially comprising a greatest-hits collection, <i>Sports</i> went on to sell some 10 million copies. Among those six hits were the shout-your-city’s-name-here opener “The Heart of Rock and Roll” and the winking “I Want a New Drug”, revelling in its retro regular-guy style at a moment when MTV-driven avant-garde electro-pop was in vogue. “We knew we needed a hit,” Lewis says. “We didn’t think we were going to have six of them.”",

Among those six hits were the shout-your-city’s-name-here opener “The Heart of Rock and Roll” and the winking “I Want a New Drug”, revelling in its retro regular-guy style at a moment when MTV-driven avant-garde electro-pop was in vogue. “We knew we needed a hit,” Lewis says. “We didn’t think we were going to have six of them.”",

            "content": "Sports is the third album by rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released on September 15, 1983, by Chrysalis Records. It reached #1 on the Billboard 200 on June 30, 1984, and ultimately charted for 160 weeks. Sports was ranked #2 on the Billboard year-end album chart for 1984 and spawned four top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Heart and Soul\" and \"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" earning Grammy Award nominations. Sports also did very well internationally, where most of its singles charted in the top 40 in multiple countries. The album has been certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" was developed after the band performed at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio in 1980, which they had been told was a \"great rock & roll town\". The following day, Lewis told his bandmates that he felt the heart of rock and roll really was in Cleveland and thought the sentiment would make for a good song, but the band convinced him to slightly alter the lyrics to \"the heart of rock & roll is still beating\".\n\n\"Bad Is Bad\" was penned with Lewis' original band, Clover. It was written in the late 1970s while Lewis was working with Thin Lizzy, whose frontman Phil Lynott liked the song so much that he would sing a fast paced version at some of his concerts. Another version of \"Bad Is Bad\" appeared on Dave Edmunds' album Repeat When Necessary (1979), featuring Lewis on harmonica.\n\nThe idea for \"I Want a New Drug\" came to Lewis during a car ride to his lawyer's office, and he wrote down the majority of the lyrics upon arriving. After Lewis made an unsuccessful attempt to put the idea to music with bassist Mario Cipollina, guitarist Chris Hayes developed new music for the final song on his own.\n\n\"Walking on a Thin Line\", written by Andre Pessis and former Clover member Kevin Wells, was about the poor treatment of veterans who returned home from the Vietnam War. \"Finally Found a Home\", inspired by an offhand comment about \"ticky-tacky\" houses near an airport, later progressed into a song about having a career in the music business. Saxophonist/guitarist Johnny Colla wrote the music for \"If This Is It\" alone and gave the song to Lewis, who penned the lyrics on a tour bus. \"You Crack Me Up\", written by Lewis and Cipollina, was based on various people the band had encountered in the parking lot of Uncle Charlie's, a bar the band had frequently performed at before they achieved mainstream success.\n\nSports also contains cover versions of \"Heart and Soul\", written by the songwriting team of Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, and \"Honky Tonk Blues\", written by Hank Williams.\n\n\"Back in the day you wanted your albums to have a theme, and Sports' theme was really a collection of singles ... It was really a record for its time. In the 80s, the way radio was programmed, if you didn't have a hit record you weren't going to be able to make any more records. That was it, period. So our priority was to come up with hit singles. Every tune we aimed for radio 'cause we didn't know which one was going to be a hit. We just knew we needed a frickin' hit, period. And fortunately we got 'em.\"\n—Huey Lewis; Billboard magazine, 2013 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Huey+Lewis+&+The+News/Sports\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached #1 on the Billboard 200 on June 30, 1984, and ultimately charted for 160 weeks. Sports was ranked #2 on the Billboard year-end album chart for 1984 and spawned four top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Heart and Soul\" and \"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" earning Grammy Award nominations. Sports also did very well internationally, where most of its singles charted in the top 40 in multiple countries. The album has been certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" was developed after the band performed at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio in 1980, which they had been told was a \"great rock & roll town\". The following day, Lewis told his bandmates that he felt the heart of rock and roll really was in Cleveland and thought the sentiment would make for a good song, but the band convinced him to slightly alter the lyrics to \"the heart of rock & roll is still beating\".\n\n\"Bad Is Bad\" was penned with Lewis' original band, Clover. It was written in the late 1970s while Lewis was working with Thin Lizzy, whose frontman Phil Lynott liked the song so much that he would sing a fast paced version at some of his concerts. Another version of \"Bad Is Bad\" appeared on Dave Edmunds' album Repeat When Necessary (1979), featuring Lewis on harmonica.\n\nThe idea for \"I Want a New Drug\" came to Lewis during a car ride to his lawyer's office, and he wrote down the majority of the lyrics upon arriving. After Lewis made an unsuccessful attempt to put the idea to music with bassist Mario Cipollina, guitarist Chris Hayes developed new music for the final song on his own.\n\n\"Walking on a Thin Line\", written by Andre Pessis and former Clover member Kevin Wells, was about the poor treatment of veterans who returned home from the Vietnam War. \"Finally Found a Home\", inspired by an offhand comment about \"ticky-tacky\" houses near an airport, later progressed into a song about having a career in the music business. Saxophonist/guitarist Johnny Colla wrote the music for \"If This Is It\" alone and gave the song to Lewis, who penned the lyrics on a tour bus. \"You Crack Me Up\", written by Lewis and Cipollina, was based on various people the band had encountered in the parking lot of Uncle Charlie's, a bar the band had frequently performed at before they achieved mainstream success.\n\nSports also contains cover versions of \"Heart and Soul\", written by the songwriting team of Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, and \"Honky Tonk Blues\", written by Hank Williams.\n\n\"Back in the day you wanted your albums to have a theme, and Sports' theme was really a collection of singles ... It was really a record for its time. In the 80s, the way radio was programmed, if you didn't have a hit record you weren't going to be able to make any more records. That was it, period. So our priority was to come up with hit singles. Every tune we aimed for radio 'cause we didn't know which one was going to be a hit. We just knew we needed a frickin' hit, period. And fortunately we got 'em.\"\n—Huey Lewis; Billboard magazine, 2013 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Huey+Lewis+&+The+News/Sports\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
