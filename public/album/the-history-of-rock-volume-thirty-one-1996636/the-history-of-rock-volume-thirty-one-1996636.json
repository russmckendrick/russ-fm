      "biography": "The Stranglers is a rock music group, formed on September 11, 1974 in Guildford, Surrey, England, United Kingdom. They were originally called The Guildford Stranglers and operated from an off-licence in the town. They also based themselves in the nearby village of Chiddingfold for a while. \n\nOriginal personnel were singer/guitarist Hugh Cornwell (from Kentish Town, London), keyboardist/guitarist Hans Wärmling (from Sweden, replaced within two years by Brighton-born keyboardist Dave Greenfield), London-born bass guitarist Jean-Jacques Burnel and drummer Jet Black (real name Brian Duffy), a native of Ilford, Essex.\n\nThey began as a sinister sounding, hard-edged pub rock group, but eventually branched out to explore other styles of music. The Stranglers were, beginning in 1976, tangentially associated with punk rock, due in part to their opening for The Ramones' first British tour. The Stranglers were also associated with new wave music as well as gothic rock, but their idiosyncratic approach never fit completely within a musical genre.\n\nIn August 1990, founding member Cornwell left the band to pursue a solo career. In his autobiography, Cornwell states that he felt the band was a spent force creatively, and cited various examples of his increasingly acrimonious relationship with his fellow band-members, particularly Burnel. The remaining members recruited two replacements, including John Ellis, who had opened for the band in the 1970s as a member of The Vibrators, and singer Paul Roberts.\n\nInterest in The Stranglers resurfaced when, in 2001, singer Tori Amos covered their song \"Strange Little Girl\" and titled the album it was featured on Strange Little Girls. \"Golden Brown\" was also used in the hit film Snatch by film director Guy Ritchie and extensively in the Australian film He Died With A Felafel In His Hand. Their hit \"No More Heroes\" was covered by Violent Femmes and used for the film Mystery Men. \"Peaches\", finally, also appears prominently in another British movie, Sexy Beast by director Jonathan Glazer.\n\nThe Stranglers had a critical and popular renaissance in 2004 (together with their first top 40 hit for 14 years - \"Big Thing Coming\") with the acclaimed Norfolk Coast album and a subsequent sell-out tour. The follow-up album, Suite XVI, was released in September 2006 (the title is a pun on \"Sweet 16\" and also a reference to the fact that it is the band's 16th studio album).\n\nDuring the recording of Suite XVI Paul Roberts left the band to pursue his solocareer. Guitarist Baz Warne, who replaced John Ellis in 2000, became the main vocalist.\n\nA quite rare Hugh Cornwell audio interview may be listened to on http://www.jasonwrightonline.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Stranglers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "biography": "There are three artists that have used this name\n1. A popular British new wave band\n2. An American rapper\n3. A Nigerian Dancehall artist\n\n1. Squeeze are a rock band which formed in London, England in 1974. The band was formed by songwriters Glenn Tilbrook (vocals, guitar) and Chris Difford (guitar, vocals) who have been the group's only constant members since the band's formation (with the exception of Difford's hiatus from the band in 1999). Aside from Difford and Tilbrook, the band currently consists of Stephen Large (keyboards), Lucy Shaw (bass) and Simon Hanson (drums).\n\nThe group initially split in 1982, but reunited in 1985 until splitting once more in 1999. Difford and Tilbrook reunited the band in 2007 with bassist John Bentley (who had been a member of the band from 1980 to 1982), keyboardist Stephen Large and drummer Simon Hanson.\n\nThe original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland.  Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike and the Mechanics as well as a solo artist.\n\nSince the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks.\n\nIn 2007, Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain. These dates are to support a new Greatest Hits CD and DVD (Essential Squeeze- released 30/04/07)  Glenn Tilbrook is also releasing his original demos on CD, the first of these (The Past Has Been Bottled) is also released on 30/04/07. \n\n2.
