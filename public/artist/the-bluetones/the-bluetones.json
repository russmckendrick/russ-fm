  "biography": "The Bluetones are an alternative rock band formed in Hounslow, England in 1994, featuring Mark Morriss (vocals, keyboards & occasional guitar), Adam Devlin (guitars), Scott Morriss (bass guitar & backing vocals), and Eds Chesters (drums)\n\nClassed as a Britpop band, given that their appearance and initial huge success with songs such as Slight Return coincided synchronously with the Britpop explosion, their debut record Expecting To Fly appeared in 1996.\n\nAs time has gone by, the band have actually become a more conventional 'indie' band - whilst notching up hits such as Marblehead Johnson, If... and Keep the Home Fires Burning they have struggled to replicate the success of their debut. After seven singles reaching the UK Top 20 in total, they are now well out of the public eye, but unlike almost all of the fellow 'Britpop' bands, they continue to release new material and tour.\n\nFollowing two further albums on major, A&M/Universal (1998's Return to the Last Chance Saloon and 2000's Science & Nature), they signed to the big indie, Cooking Vinyl in 2003 for Luxembourg and 2006's The Bluetones.\n\nVocalist Mark Morriss released a solo EP under the alias Fi-Lo Beddow in 2006, which eventually bloomed into a full solo record under his real name. Memory Muscle was released in June 2008, and received a surprising amount of critical acclaim, given the music press' frosty attitude to Bluetones material.  It included new versions of the songs which made up the Fi-Lo Beddow EP, and featured strings arrnaged by film score composer David Arnold.\n\nThe band released their final album, A New Athens, in 2010, and completed their farewell tour in September 2011.\n\nIt was announced on 13 April 2015 that the band was reforming for a tour and have subsequently toured on further occasions, including a headline slot on the 2017 Star Shaped Festival tour. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bluetones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Very successful at the peak of Britpop in the mid-90's scoring a debut number one album, knocking [a=Oasis (2)]'s (What's The Story) Morning Glory? from the top spot. The Bluetones just missed out on a number one single with \"Slight Return\" (arguably their most famous song), being kept away by [a=Babylon Zoo]'s \"Spaceman\" (featured in a Levi's TV ad).  Scott joked that he actually bought a copy of \"Spaceman\".  \r\n\r\nIn their early days they shared a house in Hounslow with [a=Dodgy].\r\n\r\nThey decided to call it a day in 2011 with a farewell tour.  Mark continued to record and tour solo material.  The band reformed for an anniversary tour in 2015/6 and also re-released two demos (including Slight Return) on a limited 7\" vinyl for the occasion.  \r\n\r\nEds went to school with [a=Gem Archer] of [a=Heavy Stereo] and, more famously, [a=Oasis (2)].",

        "profile": "London-based four-piece indie-pop band formed in 1993.  Very successful at the peak of Britpop in the mid-90's scoring a debut number one album, knocking [a=Oasis (2)]'s (What's The Story) Morning Glory? from the top spot. The Bluetones just missed out on a number one single with \"Slight Return\" (arguably their most famous song), being kept away by [a=Babylon Zoo]'s \"Spaceman\" (featured in a Levi's TV ad).  Scott joked that he actually bought a copy of \"Spaceman\".  \r\n\r\nIn their early days they shared a house in Hounslow with [a=Dodgy].\r\n\r\nThey decided to call it a day in 2011 with a farewell tour.  Mark continued to record and tour solo material.  The band reformed for an anniversary tour in 2015/6 and also re-released two demos (including Slight Return) on a limited 7\" vinyl for the occasion.  \r\n\r\nEds went to school with [a=Gem Archer] of [a=Heavy Stereo] and, more famously, [a=Oasis (2)].",

      "bio_content": "The Bluetones are an alternative rock band formed in Hounslow, England in 1994, featuring Mark Morriss (vocals, keyboards & occasional guitar), Adam Devlin (guitars), Scott Morriss (bass guitar & backing vocals), and Eds Chesters (drums)\n\nClassed as a Britpop band, given that their appearance and initial huge success with songs such as Slight Return coincided synchronously with the Britpop explosion, their debut record Expecting To Fly appeared in 1996.\n\nAs time has gone by, the band have actually become a more conventional 'indie' band - whilst notching up hits such as Marblehead Johnson, If... and Keep the Home Fires Burning they have struggled to replicate the success of their debut. After seven singles reaching the UK Top 20 in total, they are now well out of the public eye, but unlike almost all of the fellow 'Britpop' bands, they continue to release new material and tour.\n\nFollowing two further albums on major, A&M/Universal (1998's Return to the Last Chance Saloon and 2000's Science & Nature), they signed to the big indie, Cooking Vinyl in 2003 for Luxembourg and 2006's The Bluetones.\n\nVocalist Mark Morriss released a solo EP under the alias Fi-Lo Beddow in 2006, which eventually bloomed into a full solo record under his real name. Memory Muscle was released in June 2008, and received a surprising amount of critical acclaim, given the music press' frosty attitude to Bluetones material.  It included new versions of the songs which made up the Fi-Lo Beddow EP, and featured strings arrnaged by film score composer David Arnold.\n\nThe band released their final album, A New Athens, in 2010, and completed their farewell tour in September 2011.\n\nIt was announced on 13 April 2015 that the band was reforming for a tour and have subsequently toured on further occasions, including a headline slot on the 2017 Star Shaped Festival tour. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Bluetones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
