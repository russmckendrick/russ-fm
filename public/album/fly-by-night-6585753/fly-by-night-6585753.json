      "biography": "Rush is a Canadian rock band formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal on their first album, then encompassing hard rock, progressive rock, and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. They have been cited as an influence by various musical artists, including Metallica, Primus, and The Smashing Pumpkins,as well as progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater and Symphony X.\n\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush's sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\nThe band finished the second leg of the Time Machine Tour in July 2011 and released their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels in June 2012 with a supporting tour in the fall.",

            "content": "Fly by Night is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in February 1975.\n \nThis was the first Rush album to feature drummer Neil Peart. In addition to drumming duties, Peart also took on the job of lyricist by default, leading the band to adopt a more literary lyrical style that differed significantly from the debut album. The songs \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Rivendell\" are examples of the inclusion of fantasy themes into Rush's music, although the latter was penned by Geddy Lee.\n\n\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" was inspired by Rush roadie Howard Ungerleider's story of him staying at Anthem records owner Ray Danniels' house, where his two dogs, a German shepherd growled at him, and a tiny dog tried to jump on him. Ungerleider told Rush about it and they thought it was hilarious.\n\n\"Anthem\" features lyrics inspired by the philosophy of Ayn Rand, whose influence on Peart's writing would reach its apogee on the band's 1976 album 2112. The autobiographical \"Fly by Night\" is based on Peart's experience of moving from Canada to London as a young musician (long before joining Rush), while \"Making Memories\" appears to be an account of experiences from the band's first tour. The original hand-penned lyrics for both \"Anthem\" and \"Fly by Night\" include different or additional lyrics not sung in the original songs. Although the original lyrics for \"Anthem\" include the line \"carry your head\", they are sung as \"hold your head\", as well as other minor changes such as a change from \"anthem of the heart and mind\" to \"anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind\". The original lyrics to \"Fly By Night\" include a prologue which is not found in the final song.\n\nFly by Night was recorded at Toronto Sound Studios in Toronto. Rush also recorded parts of their first album at the same studio. However, since the first album sessions the studio was updated from 1 inch 8-track to 2 inch 16-track master tape recorders. The new equipment allowed the group to have far more flexibility in overdubbing and mixing. Pictures shown on the album artwork indicate that the studio used a Studer 16 track recorder and a Neve mixing console. This combination was widely considered to be state of the art by audio engineers. It was also used by many other top studios worldwide up through the early 1990's. Fly by Night marked the debut of Terry Brown as producer (although he had remixed their debut release.) This was a role he would maintain until 1982's Signals.\n\n\n\nAll songs written by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, except where noted.\n\n\nSide one\n\"Anthem\" – 4:10 \n\"Best I Can\" (Lee) – 3:24 \n\"Beneath, Between & Behind\" (Lifeson, Peart) – 3:00 \n\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" – 8:37 \nI. At the Tobes of Hades \nII. Across the Styx \nIII. Of the Battle \nChallenge and Defiance \n7/4 War Furor \nAftermath \nHymn of Triumph \nIV. Epilogue \n\nSide two\n\"Fly by Night\" (Lee, Peart) – 3:20 \n\"Making Memories\" – 2:56 \n\"Rivendell\" (Lee, Peart) – 5:00 \n\"In the End\" (Lee, Lifeson) – 6:51 \n\n\n\n\nCredits\nGeddy Lee – bass guitar, classical guitar, vocals \nAlex Lifeson – six- and 12-string acoustic and electric guitars \nNeil Peart – percussion \n\nChart Positions\nCountry Chart Position \nU.S. Billboard 200 148 \n\n\nSales Certifications\nCountry Organization Sales \nU.S. RIAA Platinum (1,000,000) \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rush/Fly+by+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
