      "biography": "The Police was a rock band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- \"Outlandos d'Amour\" (1978), \"Reggatta de Blanc\" (1979), \"Zenyatta Mondatta\" (1980), \"Ghost in the Machine\" (1982) and \"Synchronicity\" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986\n\nThe band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. \n\nBiography \n\nThe Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.\n\nThe Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.\n\nThe Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and bass lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other \"white\" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of \"Babylon\", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like \"Roxanne\".\n\nTension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. \n\nIn 1992 the band released \"Message in a Box\", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.\n\nThe Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. \n\nSting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; \"Tea in the Sahara\" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .\n\nDiscography \n\n* Outlandos d'Amour (1978)\n* Reggatta de Blanc (1979)\n* Zenyatta Mondatta (1980)\n* Ghost in the Machine (1981)\n* Synchronicity (1983) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Vocalist-bassist Sting worked as a school teacher by day and a jazz musician at night, while drummer Stewart Copeland was a tour manager and drummer for the prog band Curved Air. And guitarist Andy Summers had been kicking around the British music scene since the 1960s, with stints playing with (among others) Soft Machine and The Animals.\n\nWhen the musicians came together as The Police, they filtered these disparate influences into a lively debut album, <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i>. Fittingly, the trio made the album with another unexpected pick: engineer Nigel Gray, a medical doctor who moonlighted in music and operated the Surrey Sound Studios. Recorded on a shoestring budget over six months, <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> included the expected raucous barn burners (“Truth Hits Everybody”) alongside laid-back reggae rock (“So Lonely,” “Can’t Stand Losing You”) and quirky pub rock (“Hole In My Life”, “Born in the 50’s”).\n\nMusically, Sting’s nimble basslines meshed well with Copeland’s fluid grooves, giving <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> a crisp, no-nonsense rhythmic foundation, while Summers dug into his arsenal of experience for guitar riffs. An urgent vocalist, Sting brought depth and sincerity to these yearning songs—which also helped the tango “Roxanne” (featuring a narrator who tells his beloved she no longer has to work in a red light district) an unexpected hit. And in what would become a hallmark for The Police, the album contains a few sonic curveballs—the laugh and uneasy piano at the beginning of “Roxanne”, or a spoken-word bridge on the tensile “Be My Girl—Sally”. In the end, <i>Outlandos d’Amour</i> is one of the most influential albums of the punk era—a forward-looking record that captured the excitement and energy of the burgeoning New Wave movement.",

            "content": "Outlandos d'Amour is the debut album by The Police, released in 1978. The title is a loose French translation of \"Outlaws of Love\", with the first word being a combination of the words \"outlaws\" and \"commandos\", and \"d'Amour\" meaning \"of love\".\n\nThe LP initially flopped, due to low exposure and an unfavourable reaction from the BBC to its first two singles, \"Can't Stand Losing You\" and \"Roxanne\" (about suicide and prostitution, respectively). As Sting describes:\n“ ...We had  publicity campaign with posters about how the BBC banned \"Roxanne\". The reason they had a problem with \"Can't Stand Losing You\" was because the photo on the cover of the single had Stewart standing on a block of ice with a noose around his neck, waiting for the ice to melt. \t”\n\nHowever, the band's low-budget tour of America in support of the album made people across the country aware of the band, and especially \"Roxanne\". The song received more and more airplay from radio DJs in both the United States and Great Britain through April 1979. When A&M re-released \"Roxanne\", it went to #12 on the UK charts, and \"Can't Stand Losing You\" followed, eventually hitting #2. The album itself peaked at #6.\n\nThe album starts off with \"Next To You\", a punk number with a slide guitar solo in the middle. \"So Lonely\", a song about loneliness with a reggae beat follows. \"Roxanne\", about a prostitute, was written by Sting after visiting a red-light district in Paris and is (along with \"Every Breath You Take\") one of the Police's best-known songs. It is followed by \"Hole in My Life\", another reggae-type song about loneliness, and \"Peanuts\", a Sting-Stewart Copeland collaboration with a strong punk influence. \"Can't Stand Losing You\" and \"Truth Hits Everybody\", a pair of ominous songs detailing love gone wrong, begin Side Two of the original LP. \"Born in the 50's\", which is about the experiences of Sting and Copeland's generation (Andy Summers was born in 1942), and \"Be My Girl -- Sally\", a combination of a half-finished song sung by Sting, and a short Andy Summers poem about a blowup doll (one of the rare songs with Andy on lead vocals). This leads into the album's semi-instrumental closer, \"Masoko Tanga\".\n\nPolice manager Miles Copeland III originally wanted to name the album Police Brutality. However, after hearing \"Roxanne\" and then envisioning a more romantic image for the band, he proposed Outlandos d'Amour instead. This title was derived from \"Outlaws of Love\", which was merged with the word \"commandos\" and then given an exotic-sounding French translation.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 434 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Outlandos+D%27Amour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_content": "Outlandos d'Amour is the debut album by The Police, released in 1978. The title is a loose French translation of \"Outlaws of Love\", with the first word being a combination of the words \"outlaws\" and \"commandos\", and \"d'Amour\" meaning \"of love\".\n\nThe LP initially flopped, due to low exposure and an unfavourable reaction from the BBC to its first two singles, \"Can't Stand Losing You\" and \"Roxanne\" (about suicide and prostitution, respectively). As Sting describes:\n“ ...We had  publicity campaign with posters about how the BBC banned \"Roxanne\". The reason they had a problem with \"Can't Stand Losing You\" was because the photo on the cover of the single had Stewart standing on a block of ice with a noose around his neck, waiting for the ice to melt. \t”\n\nHowever, the band's low-budget tour of America in support of the album made people across the country aware of the band, and especially \"Roxanne\". The song received more and more airplay from radio DJs in both the United States and Great Britain through April 1979. When A&M re-released \"Roxanne\", it went to #12 on the UK charts, and \"Can't Stand Losing You\" followed, eventually hitting #2. The album itself peaked at #6.\n\nThe album starts off with \"Next To You\", a punk number with a slide guitar solo in the middle. \"So Lonely\", a song about loneliness with a reggae beat follows. \"Roxanne\", about a prostitute, was written by Sting after visiting a red-light district in Paris and is (along with \"Every Breath You Take\") one of the Police's best-known songs. It is followed by \"Hole in My Life\", another reggae-type song about loneliness, and \"Peanuts\", a Sting-Stewart Copeland collaboration with a strong punk influence. \"Can't Stand Losing You\" and \"Truth Hits Everybody\", a pair of ominous songs detailing love gone wrong, begin Side Two of the original LP. \"Born in the 50's\", which is about the experiences of Sting and Copeland's generation (Andy Summers was born in 1942), and \"Be My Girl -- Sally\", a combination of a half-finished song sung by Sting, and a short Andy Summers poem about a blowup doll (one of the rare songs with Andy on lead vocals). This leads into the album's semi-instrumental closer, \"Masoko Tanga\".\n\nPolice manager Miles Copeland III originally wanted to name the album Police Brutality. However, after hearing \"Roxanne\" and then envisioning a more romantic image for the band, he proposed Outlandos d'Amour instead. This title was derived from \"Outlaws of Love\", which was merged with the word \"commandos\" and then given an exotic-sounding French translation.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 434 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Outlandos+D%27Amour\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
