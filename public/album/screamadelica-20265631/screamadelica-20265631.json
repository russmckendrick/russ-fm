      "biography": "Primal Scream are a Scottish alternative rock band originally formed in 1982 in Glasgow by Bobby Gillespie (vocals) and Jim Beattie and now based in London. The current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Martin Duffy (keyboards), and Darrin Mooney (drums). Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \"Throb\" Young.\n\nThe band performed throughout 1982-1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band were a key part of the mid-1980s indie pop scene, but eventually moved away from their more jangly sound, taking on more psychedelic and then garage rock influences, before incorporating a dance music element to their sound. Their 1991 album Screamadelica broke the band into the mainstream. Despite multiple lineup changes, the band has remained commercially successful and continues to tour and record.",

In 1998 Q magazine readers voted it the 27th greatest album of all time.\n\nThe album was a massive departure from the band's early indie rock sound, drawing inspiration from the house music scene (and associated drugs) that was becoming popular at the time of its production. The band enlisted house DJs Andrew Weatherall and Terry Farley on producing duties, although the album also contained a wide range of other influences including gospel and dub.\n\nThe album's title track did not appear on the album itself; the ten minute dance track was also produced by Andrew Weatherall and sung by Denise Johnson. It appears on the Dixie Narco EP released in 1992, and featured in the opening credits of the now rare Screamadelica VHS video tape.\n\nThe album includes \"Loaded\", which was a top twenty hit single in the UK. Dance DJ Andrew Weatherall began remixing \"I'm Losing More than I'll Ever Have\", from their previous album, and the resulting track disassembled the song, adding a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell's \"What I Am\", a sample of Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson's \"Terraplane Blues\" and the central introductory sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie The Wild Angels. The single \"Movin' On Up\" was the band's breakthrough hit in the United States, reaching #2 on the Modern Rock Tracks, and also making #28 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\nThe album cover for Screamadelica was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of \"Classic Album Cover\" postage stamps issued in January 2010.\n\nA number of samples were used in the production of the album:\n\n    * \"Come Together\" opens with part of a speech given by Jesse Jackson at the Wattstax concert held in Los Angeles in 1972.\n    * \"Loaded\" features lines spoken by Peter Fonda's character in the 1966 movie The Wild Angels a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell's \"What I Am\".\n    * \"Slip Inside This House\" features Sly Stone's laugh from the end of the song \"Sex Machine\" (Stand! - 1969) and the Amen break.\n    * \"Inner Flight\" samples the closing sound on Brian Eno's \"The Great Pretender\" from the album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).\n    * \"Higher than the Sun\" uses a sample from \"Wah Wah Man\" by the Young-Holt Unlimited Trio.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Primal+Scream/Screamadelica\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
