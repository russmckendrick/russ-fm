  "biography": "Jethro Tull is a British rock band formed in Blackpool, Lancashire in 1967. The band initially played blues rock and jazz fusion before incorporating elements of English folk music, hard rock, and classical music, developing a distinctive progressive rock sound. Ian Anderson, the band's founder, leader, principal composer, and lead vocalist, has been the only constant member. Anderson is a multi-instrumentalist, primarily playing flute and acoustic guitar. Over the years, the band has included several notable musicians, such as guitarists Mick Abrahams and Martin Barre (the latter being the longest-serving member after Anderson); bassists Glenn Cornick, Jeffrey Hammond, John Glascock, Dave Pegg, Jonathan Noyce, and David Goodier; drummers Clive Bunker, Barrie \"Barriemore\" Barlow, and Doane Perry; and keyboardists John Evan, Dee Palmer, Eddie Jobson, Peter-John Vettese, Andrew Giddings, and John O'Hara.\n\nJethro Tull gained moderate recognition in the London club scene before releasing their debut album, \"This Was,\" in 1968. After replacing original guitarist Mick Abrahams with Martin Barre, the band released their second album, \"Stand Up,\" in 1969, which incorporated folk influences and became their first commercial success, reaching number one in the UK. The band then maintained a heavy touring and recording schedule, releasing one studio album each year until 1980. Their musical style evolved toward progressive rock starting with the 1971 album \"Aqualung,\" which became their most commercially successful record. In the late 1970s, their sound shifted again toward folk rock. During the early 1980s, following significant lineup changes, the band explored electronic rock. Jethro Tull won a Grammy Award in 1987 for the album \"Crest of a Knave,\" which marked a return to a hard rock style. The band has sold approximately 60 million albums worldwide and has received 11 gold and 5 platinum certifications. Rolling Stone has described them as one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands.\n\nJethro Tull ceased studio recording in the 2000s but continued touring until their split in 2011. After the split, Ian Anderson and Martin Barre pursued solo careers, with Anderson performing under both his own name and the Jethro Tull name. In 2014, Anderson stated that Jethro Tull had essentially come to an end. However, starting in 2017, Anderson revived the Jethro Tull name and began releasing new studio albums in the 2020s. The current lineup includes musicians who performed with Jethro Tull in its later years as well as newer members from Anderson’s solo band, with Martin Barre no longer involved.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_(band)\n\nStudio albums\nThis Was (1968)\nStand Up (1969)\nBenefit (1970)\nAqualung (1971)\nThick as a Brick (1972)\nA Passion Play (1973)\nWar Child (1974)\nMinstrel in the Gallery (1975)\nToo Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!
