  "biography": "Fishbone is an American rock band formed in 1979 in Los Angeles, California, which plays a fusion of ska, punk, funk, heavy metal, reggae, and soul. AllMusic has described the group as \"one of the most distinctive and eclectic alternative rock bands of the late '80s. With their hyperactive, self-conscious diversity, goofy sense of humor, and sharp social commentary, the group gained a sizable cult following yet they were never able to earn a mainstream audience.\"\n\nFishbone first assembled with John Norwood Fisher (bass), his brother Philip \"Fish\" Fisher (drums), Angelo Moore (vocals, saxophones and theremin), Kendall Jones (guitar), \"Dirty\" Walter A. Kibby II (vocals, trumpet), and Christopher Dowd (keyboards, trombone, vocals). They achieved their greatest success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after which they went through many personnel changes. From 2003 to 2010, John Norwood Fisher and Angelo Moore were the last remaining original members of the band. In the 2010s, all the other original members except Kendall Jones rejoined the band for various reunions and anniversary activities. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fishbone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
