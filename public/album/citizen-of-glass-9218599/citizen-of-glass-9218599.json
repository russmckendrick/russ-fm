            "content": "During her 2014 Tour, Obel began work on her third album : \"I’m planning to work less with piano, and more with other kinds of old keyboards (...) I’m trying to find new instruments to work with, so it’s sort of on the research phase and starting to write things.\" Agnes says also : \"I have some clear ideas but I’m not sure it is a good idea to go into specifics on such an early stage. I mainly plan to work with old keyboards like spinet and harpsichord and then see where they take me.\"\n\nIn June 2015, Obel worked on her new album with a serial of mixing sessions. She recorded strings with new musicians : Frédérique Labbow, Kristina Koropecki and John Corban.\n\nIn June 2016, Agnes Obel has released a new single for her upcoming album. 'Familiar' is available in streaming service. This new song is recorded, produced and mixed by Agnes Obel and featuring violin by John Corban, cellos by Kristina Koropecki and Charlotte Danhier. The video clip is directed by her husband : Alex Brüel Flagstad. Hugo Cassavetti, from Telerama, wrote : \"Agnes Obel, while remaining true to her fine style, expands her new musical fields. Percussions with a loud power rhythm a delicately acrobatic melody that the singer performs with a voice that was strangely moved. Yes, Obel, as splitted by technology, duet with her disturbing echoes with a male stamp.\"\n\nIn July 2016, Obel announced her third studio album, Citizen of Glass, to be released on 21 October 2016. About the mysterious title, Obel explains : “The title comes from the German concept of the gläserner bürger, the human or glass citizen. It’s actually a legal term about the level of privacy the individual has in a state, and in health it’s become a term about how much we know about a person’s body or biology or history – if they’re completely made of glass we know everything.\"\n\nAmong violins, cellos, harpsichords, spinet and celesta : Agnes Obel used, for the time, a very rare Trautonium. A delicate, metal-keyed synthesiser from the late 1920s.\n\nThe tracklist of Citizen of Glass will be : Stretch Your Eyes (aka Spinet Song), Familiar, Red Virgin Soil, It’s Happening Again, Stone, Trojan Horses, Citizen Of Glass, Golden Green, Grasshopper, Mary.\n\nIn September 2016, Agnes has released a new single : \"Golden Green\". In Dansende Beren, Niels Bruwier writes : “The sound of glass is never far away. The song is about the way we always find other better lives than ours(…)she brings out her dreamy voice, it’s actually just the perfect classic pop song without embellishment. Enchanting, elysisch and paradise-like.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Agnes+Obel/Citizen+of+Glass\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
