      "biography": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band, active in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in the history of music.\nAfter changing their name, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. Led Zeppelin disliked the releasing of tracks as singles, preferring their albums to be viewed as indivisible, whole listening experiences, helping to promote the concept of album-orientated rock. Their first two albums, with their heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound, led to Led Zeppelin being regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, even though the band's individualistic style drew from varied sources and transcends any single music genre. Their next two albums incorporated wider musical influences, particularly from folk music; the fourth, untitled album, which featured the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars\". Subsequent albums saw greater musical experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which, like the group's previous tours, earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's sudden death in 1980.",

The word coda, meaning a passage that ends a musical piece following the main body, was therefore chosen as a title.\n\nLed Zeppelin guitarist and producer Jimmy Page explained that part of the reasoning for the album's release related to the popularity of unofficial Led Zeppelin recordings which continued to be circulated by fans:\nCoda was released, basically, because there was so much bootleg stuff out. We thought, \"Well, if there's that much interest, then we may as well put the rest of our studio stuff out\".\nLed Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones recalled:\nThey were good tracks. A lot of it was recorded around the time punk was really happening... basically there wasn't a lot of Zeppelin tracks that didn't go out. We used everything.\nAccording to the Led Zeppelin biography Hammer of the Gods, the band also owed Atlantic Records one more album from the five album deal that created Swan Song Records in 1974. As such, Coda can be seen as a contractual fulfillment.\n\"We're Gonna Groove\" opens the album and, according to the album notes, was recorded at Morgan Studios in June, 1969. It was later acknowledged to have come from a January, 1970 concert at the Royal Albert Hall, with the guitar parts overdubbed and the original guitar part removed—this can be heard in the original Royal Albert Hall show on 9 January 1970.\n\"Poor Tom\" is from sessions for Led Zeppelin III, having been recorded at Olympic Studios in June 1970.\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\" is taken from the same concert as \"We're Gonna Groove\" but was listed as a rehearsal in the original liner notes. The recording was edited to remove overall \"live\" feel: the crowd noise as well as the beginning and ending of the song were deleted.
