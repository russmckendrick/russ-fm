      "biography": "Manic Street Preachers are a Welsh alternative rock band that was formed in 1986 in Blackwood, South Wales and consists of James Dean Bradfield (lead vocals and lead guitar), Nicky Wire (bass guitar and lyrics) and Sean Moore (drums and percussion). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene, and were at their most prominent during the 1990s. They are colloquially known as \"The Manics\", or simply, \"Manics\". Originally a quartet, the band became a trio when primary lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995.\nIn 1992, the Manics released their debut studio album, Generation Terrorists. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery and critical social lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound.\nFollowing Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore and Wire persisted with Manic Street Preachers, and went on to gain critical and commercial success, becoming one of Britain's premier rock bands. Altogether, they have garnered eight Top 10 albums, fifteen Top 10 singles and have reached Number One three times—with their 1998 This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours album, the 1998 \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" single and the 2000 \"The Masses Against the Classes\" single.",

      "editorial_notes": "In January 1995, the members of Manic Street Preachers entered House in the Woods, a studio in Surrey (on the outskirts of London), to begin work on their fourth record. It was early days for the follow-up to their bleak, brutal masterpiece <i>The Holy Bible</i> (1994), a chance to swap ideas about where to go next and run through the handful of new songs they’d already written. But in the coming days everything changed for the four best friends from Blackwood, Wales. Guitarist and co-lyricist Richey Edwards disappeared from a London hotel room ahead of a planned promotional trip to the US. He was never seen again, eventually declared presumed dead in 2008.\n\nAt the heart of <i>Everything Must Go</i> is the story of how his former bandmates—singer and guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist and lyricist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore—put the pieces back together. It was a few months after Edwards’ disappearance that they decided to get in a room to see how—<i>if</i>—this could work. One song lit the way. In “A Design for Life”, the Manics had written a modern classic, a song that fused the rock dynamism of 1993’s <i>Gold Against the Soul</i> album with orchestral bombast and a lyric documenting the working-class struggle to form an irresistible, defiant sing-along. Their intellect and melodic talent had never been paired quite so explosively.\n\nRecorded with producer Mike Hedges in a French château—a world away from the dingy Cardiff studio that the Manics occupied for <i>The Holy Bible</i>—<i>Everything Must Go</i> was a record made up of anthem after sing-along anthem, but these songs had catharsis in their bones. On the surface, there were the subjects they were directly about: award-winning war photographers (the choppy indie rock of “Kevin Carter”); expressionist artists battling Alzheimer’s (the icy, New Order-ish groove of “Interiors (Song for Willem de Kooning)”); escapism (“Australia”’s heady, riffy rush); caged animals (the harp-assisted acoustic beauty of “Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky”). Dig a little deeper, though, and every song seemed to be holding up a mirror to something a little closer to home. Grief, loss, love, forward-motion, these are the elements running right through <i>Everything Must Go</i>.\n\nFive Edwards lyrics would make it onto the record, the deal being that the song had to have been started before he went missing. In that sense, <i>Everything Must Go</i> closed a chapter for the Manics, but another one opened. Released in May 1996, it went on to sell over two million copies and made the trio one of the biggest British bands of the ’90s, earning them Best British Group and Best Album at the 1997 BRIT Awards. A masterpiece record in a decade that wasn’t short of masterpiece records, <i>Everything Must Go</i> was never the sound of a band leaving everything behind. They took it all with them. This was Manic Street Preachers building a bridge to the future.",

It was released on 20 May 1996, through Epic Records, and was the first record released by the band following the disappearance of lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards.\n\nReleased at the height of Britpop in the mid-1990s, the album was a commercial and critical success, it reached its peak in the UK on separate occasions, debuting and peaking at number 2 in the UK Albums Chart and earned the band accolades in the 1997 Brit Awards. It represented a shift in the group's sound due to Edwards' departure. The album charted in mainland Europe, Asia and Australia, eventually selling over two million copies. Everything Must Go is frequently featured and voted highly in lists for one of the best albums of all time by many music publications such as NME and Q.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. \"A Design for Life\" reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, spending 3 weeks in the top 10 and a total of 14 weeks in the Top 100 being certified Silver in the UK, for sales above 200.000 copies. \"Everything Must Go\", the second single, peaked at number 5, enjoying 10 weeks in the UK Top 100. \"Kevin Carter\", the third single, peaked at number 9, spending 8 weeks in the UK Top 100, being the single from the album that spent the least weeks in the charts because the last single, \"Australia\", reached number 7 and despite tumbling to number 31 in the second sales week, managed to stay in the UK Singles Chart Top 100 for 9 weeks. All the singles thus charted in the UK Top 10, between 1996 and 1997. \"Further Away\" was released in October 1996, but only in Japan, replacing the UK single \"Kevin Carter\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/Everything+Must+Go\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It represented a shift in the group's sound due to Edwards' departure. The album charted in mainland Europe, Asia and Australia, eventually selling over two million copies. Everything Must Go is frequently featured and voted highly in lists for one of the best albums of all time by many music publications such as NME and Q.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. \"A Design for Life\" reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, spending 3 weeks in the top 10 and a total of 14 weeks in the Top 100 being certified Silver in the UK, for sales above 200.000 copies. \"Everything Must Go\", the second single, peaked at number 5, enjoying 10 weeks in the UK Top 100. \"Kevin Carter\", the third single, peaked at number 9, spending 8 weeks in the UK Top 100, being the single from the album that spent the least weeks in the charts because the last single, \"Australia\", reached number 7 and despite tumbling to number 31 in the second sales week, managed to stay in the UK Singles Chart Top 100 for 9 weeks. All the singles thus charted in the UK Top 10, between 1996 and 1997. \"Further Away\" was released in October 1996, but only in Japan, replacing the UK single \"Kevin Carter\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Manic+Street+Preachers/Everything+Must+Go\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
