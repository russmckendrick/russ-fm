      "biography": "Ann \"Annie\" Lennox, OBE (born 25 December 1954) is a Scottish singer-songwriter, political activist and philanthropist. After achieving minor success in the late 1970s as part of the New Wave band The Tourists, she and fellow musician David A. Stewart went on to achieve major international success in the 1980s as Eurythmics. Lennox is the most recognized female artist at the Brit Awards, winning a total of eight awards. She has also been named the \"Brits Champion of Champions\".\n\nLennox embarked on a solo career in the 1990s with her debut album, Diva (1992), which produced several hit singles including \"Why\" and \"Walking on Broken Glass\". To date, she has released five solo studio albums and a compilation album, The Annie Lennox Collection (2009). She is the recipient of eight Brit Awards, four Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award. In 2002, Lennox received a Billboard Century Award; the highest accolade from Billboard Magazine. In 2004, she won both the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Into the West\", written for the soundtrack to the feature film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\n\nIn addition to her career as a musician, Lennox is also a political and social activist, notable for raising money and awareness for HIV charities in Africa. She also objected to the unauthorised use of the 1999 Eurythmics song \"I Saved the World Today\" in an election broadcast for Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni in 2009. In 2011, Lennox was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for her \"tireless charity campaigns and championing of humanitarian causes\". On 4 June 2012, Lennox performed at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert in front of Buckingham Palace, London.\n\nLennox has been named \"The Greatest White Soul Singer Alive\" by VH1 and one of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone.] She has earned the distinction of \"most successful female British artist in UK music history\" due to her commercial success since the early 1980s. Including her work within Eurythmics, Lennox has sold over 80 million records worldwide.",

The album entered the UK album chart at no.1 and has since sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK alone, being certified quadruple platinum. It was also a success in the U.S. where it was a top 30 hit and has sold in excess of 2 million copies there.\n\nA special video album was also released at the same time, directed by Sophie Muller who had worked with Lennox during her years with Eurythmics. The video album featured promotional videos for nine of the album's eleven tracks (the video for the single \"Little Bird\" had not yet been made at this time, and no video was made for the album track \"Stay By Me\").\n\nIn 1993 the album was included in Q magazine's list of the \"50 Best Albums Of 1992\". Rolling Stone magazine (6/25/92, p.41) described the album as \"...state-of-the-art soul pop...\" and it is included in Rolling Stone's (5/13/99, p.56) \"Essential Recordings of the 90's\" list. Several songs from the album were released as singles with \"Why\", \"Walking on Broken Glass\" and \"Little Bird\" being the most successful.\n\nThe original vinyl release of the album only had ten tracks, and Keep Young and Beautiful was included on the CD release as a bonus track. Another bonus track, \"Step by Step\", appeared on the Mexican and Japanese editions of the album and was also included as the B-Side on the \"Precious\" single. The song was later recorded by Whitney Houston for the 1996 film soundtrack The Preacher's Wife and subsequently became a hit single. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Annie+Lennox/Diva\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
