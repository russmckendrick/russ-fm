      "biography": "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on 24  May 1941, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and artist. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for five decades. Zimmerman changed his surname to Dylan in homage to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who had frequented the streets and bars of New York's Greenwich Village a generation earlier. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\", became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" has been described as radically altering the parameters of popular music in 1965. His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.\n\nDylan's lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, and the music and performance styles of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Elvis Presley, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored numerous distinct traditions in American song-from folk, blues and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.\n\nDylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.",

      "editorial_notes": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> “I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head,” Bob Dylan howls toward the middle of his epiphanic 1965 album, <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>, shooting out of a ragged harmonica solo during the rollicking “From a Buick 6” to diagnose his own condition. At that moment, the twenty-something Dylan—the unofficial youth poet laureate of the United States, as well as the sneering voice of an emergent counterculture—had a lot on his mind, and perhaps more on his professional plate. When he returned stateside after a breakneck British tour in May 1965, he was exhausted, having released five albums—including four certifiable landmarks—in just three years. Was he out of things to say, out of the drive to say them?\n\nBut, as legend has it, a long stream-of-consciousness manuscript later that month yielded “Like a Rolling Stone”, an anthem of youthful restlessness and grit aimed at a world of know-it-all cynics. Dylan cut it early that summer above Al Kooper’s roaring organ line, then headed to Newport to debut his electric band to a crowd incensed by his folk volte-face. When he returned to the studio just a few days later with a fresh producer—the largely unproven Bob Johnston—he indeed had a lot to unload, and he’d air his grievances via his newly perfected, warped blues-rock sound.\n\nDylan’s frustration comes through on these nine songs, which find him railing against the world’s barbaric weight (“Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues”), against high society’s superficial wisdom (“Ballad of a Thin Man”) and against the heart’s tangles and briars (“It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry”). The direct appeals of his earlier works have yielded to deeply referential poetry, resulting in a self-made associative universe in which lovers walk like Bo Diddley, God dispatches Abraham to the Blues Highway along the Mississippi River, and where Einstein slips into Robin Hood’s garb. These were the images of an overheated mind, acting out the theatre of human experience—youth versus age, freedom versus oppression, joy versus anxiety—in rock song.\n\nAs controversial as it may have been to some, Dylan’s electric pivot on all of these songs, save the brilliant capstone “Desolation Row”, could not have arrived at a better time. The dancehall crackle of the title track, the gothic groan of “Ballad of a Thin Man” and the amphetamine shimmy of “Tombstone Blues”—they all ground these songs in magnetic rock ’n’ roll trappings that gave listeners something to hold onto as the language, lessons and landscape of rock shifted in real time—something that absolutely happened on, and because of, <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>.",
