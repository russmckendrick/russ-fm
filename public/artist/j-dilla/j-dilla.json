  "biography": "James Dewitt Yancey (February 7, 1974-February 10, 2006), better known as J Dilla or Jay Dee, was an acclaimed hip-Hop producer who emerged from the mid-1990s underground Hip-Hop scene in Detroit, Michigan. He began his career as a member of the group Slum Village, and was also a driving force in the production trio The Ummah. Yancey started his career under the name Jay Dee (based on his initials) but used the name J Dilla from 2001 onward. Many critics believe J Dilla's work to have had a major influence on his peers and that he embodied the neo soul sound, playing a defining yet understated role during the sub-genre's rise (roughly from the mid-90s to the early 2000s). J Dilla was often dubbed \"your favorite producer's favorite producer,\" and was highly regarded by hip hop artists and producers such as Royce Da 5'9\", Common, Kanye West, A Tribe Called Quest, Just Blaze, Busta Rhymes, Pharrell Williams, Madlib, The Pharcyde, Slum Village and ?uestlove.",

      "profile": "American hip hop DJ/producer. \r\n\r\nBorn: 7 February 1974 in Detroit, Michigan, USA. \r\nDied: 10 February 2006 in Los Angeles, California, USA (aged 32). \r\n\r\nJames Dewitt Yancey, better known by his stage name J Dilla or Jay Dee, was an American record producer who emerged from the mid-1990s underground hip-hop scene in Detroit, Michigan. \r\n\r\nHe began his career as a member of the group [a=Slum Village], and made his name with [a=Common], [a=A Tribe Called Quest], and as [a=Jaylib] in which he collaborated with [a=Madlib]. He was also a member of the production team trio [url=https://www.discogs.com/fr/artist/56441-The-Ummah]The Ummah[/url] with [a=Q-Tip] and [a=Ali Shaheed Muhammad]. \r\n\r\nHe started his career under the name Jay Dee (based on his initials) but used the name J Dilla from 2001 onward. Many critics believe his work to have had a major influence on his peers and that he embodied the neo-soul sound, playing a defining yet understated role during the sub-genre's rise (roughly from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s). LA-based producer and MC, Madlib, began collaborating with J Dilla, and the pair formed the group Jaylib in 2002, releasing an album called \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Jaylib-Champion-Sound/master/124462]Champion Sound[/url]\" in 2003. After J Dilla relocated from Detroit to LA in 2004, they toured as Jaylib in Spring 2004. \r\n\r\nHe moved from his native Detroit to Los Angeles to live with his mother after being diagnosed in 2003. \r\nIt was later revealed that he suffered from TTP, a rare blood disease, and Lupus, affecting the immune-system. J Dilla's illness and medication caused dramatic weight loss from 2003 onwards, forcing him to publicly confirm speculation about his health in 2004. Despite a slower output of major releases and production credits in 2004-2005, his cult status remained strong within his core audience, as evident by unauthorized circulation of his underground \"beat tapes\" (instrumental, and raw working materials), mostly through internet file sharing. Articles in music publications URB (March 2004) and XXL (June 2005) confirmed rumors of ill health and hospitalization during this period, but these were downplayed by J himself. The seriousness of his condition became public in November 2005 when J Dilla toured Europe performing from a wheelchair. \r\n\r\nHis last album released during his lifetime, \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/J-Dilla-Donuts/master/68208]Donuts[/url]\", was released on [l=Stones Throw Records] on 7 Feb 2006, Dilla's 32nd birthday, and the first one in years he didn't spend in hospital. Three days later, on 10 February 2006, he died at his home in LA. According to his mother, [a977167], the cause was cardiac arrest. \r\n\r\nThe founding of the James Dewitt Yancey Foundation was announced in May 2006 by his mother [a977167], to honour her son's legacy and to help raise awareness and funding for Lupus research by organising continued events to aid underprivileged children gain quality arts training, primarily in the field of music. \r\n\r\nHe is brother to [a=Illa J] and his father was [a9207571]\r\n",

He was also a member of the production team trio [url=https://www.discogs.com/fr/artist/56441-The-Ummah]The Ummah[/url] with [a=Q-Tip] and [a=Ali Shaheed Muhammad]. \r\n\r\nHe started his career under the name Jay Dee (based on his initials) but used the name J Dilla from 2001 onward. Many critics believe his work to have had a major influence on his peers and that he embodied the neo-soul sound, playing a defining yet understated role during the sub-genre's rise (roughly from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s). LA-based producer and MC, Madlib, began collaborating with J Dilla, and the pair formed the group Jaylib in 2002, releasing an album called \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Jaylib-Champion-Sound/master/124462]Champion Sound[/url]\" in 2003. After J Dilla relocated from Detroit to LA in 2004, they toured as Jaylib in Spring 2004. \r\n\r\nHe moved from his native Detroit to Los Angeles to live with his mother after being diagnosed in 2003. \r\nIt was later revealed that he suffered from TTP, a rare blood disease, and Lupus, affecting the immune-system. J Dilla's illness and medication caused dramatic weight loss from 2003 onwards, forcing him to publicly confirm speculation about his health in 2004. Despite a slower output of major releases and production credits in 2004-2005, his cult status remained strong within his core audience, as evident by unauthorized circulation of his underground \"beat tapes\" (instrumental, and raw working materials), mostly through internet file sharing. Articles in music publications URB (March 2004) and XXL (June 2005) confirmed rumors of ill health and hospitalization during this period, but these were downplayed by J himself. The seriousness of his condition became public in November 2005 when J Dilla toured Europe performing from a wheelchair. \r\n\r\nHis last album released during his lifetime, \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/J-Dilla-Donuts/master/68208]Donuts[/url]\", was released on [l=Stones Throw Records] on 7 Feb 2006, Dilla's 32nd birthday, and the first one in years he didn't spend in hospital. Three days later, on 10 February 2006, he died at his home in LA. According to his mother, [a977167], the cause was cardiac arrest. \r\n\r\nThe founding of the James Dewitt Yancey Foundation was announced in May 2006 by his mother [a977167], to honour her son's legacy and to help raise awareness and funding for Lupus research by organising continued events to aid underprivileged children gain quality arts training, primarily in the field of music. \r\n\r\nHe is brother to [a=Illa J] and his father was [a9207571]\r\n",

From the onset, music was intrinsic to Jay\\'s life. His mother Maureen was an accomplished singer and lover of classical music and opera. His father Beverly was a gifted vocalist and bass player fond of vocal harmonies and jazz, who played professionally for 25 years before taking a job at Ford. A two-year-old Jay would gurgle along in perfect pitch to the sound of his father practicing on his upright bass until it lulled him to sleep.\\n\\nEspecially aware of the dangers that faced unoccupied youths growing up in their Detroit neighborhood of Conant Gardens, the Yancey\\'s set out to keep their children as busy as possible between cub scouts, music lessons, youth choir, and any other church activities. Nurturing their son\\'s early passion for music, Jay was always enrolled in some kind of music class, excelling on the piano, violin and cello, before moving on to the drums. But it was the lure of the boom-bap which ultimately moved him from the church pews to the studio.\\n\\n\"When I heard Run-D.M.C.\\'s \"Sucker M.C.\\'s (Krush-Groove 1)\" and Whodini\\'s \"Big Mouth\", it made me curious to how the beats were made. Those songs were the first time I heard the beats that weren\\'t melodic - just drums. Being someone who was taking drum lessons at the time, that made me real curious. That led me into deejaying, which slowly led to me deejaying parties and that eventually led me into production.\"\\n\\nA fortuitous meeting with another talented Conant Gardens resident provided Jay with the direction necessary to pursue his dream. \"Fortunately I ran into this cat just walking in the street, literally. This guy named Amp Fiddler. He just called us out and from that first day he actually showed all of us how a studio works and things like that. He had a little pre-production studio in his crib. He was like, \\'Whenever you want to, come by the crib.\\' I started going over there messing with beats.\"Building on the experience he received at Amp\\'s studio, Jay was determined to form a group which reflected the eclectic nature of his influences. \"I heard about T3 and Baatin, and they were supposed to be the illest emcees at the time. And I thought I was, so I wanted to challenge them. To make a long story short, we just hooked up after that. The chemistry was right.\" Their group Slum Village gave Jay the platform to create a sound which was uniquely mid- western in its melding of jazzy, east coast influences with the glossy, bounce of west coast hip-hop. \\n\\nVia another timely assist from Amp Fiddler, Slum\\'s demo found it\\'s way into the hands of Q-Tip, who immediately recognized a kindred musical spirit in Jay and offered the young producer a management and production contract. \"It was like a dream come true, if you could ever, ever hear anybody say that. I just couldn\\'t believe it. I love Tribe and De La and then this guy Tip called my crib! Matter of fact, the first time he called, I wasn\\'t home. I missed the call! I was hurt. I thought that was it! But, he called me the next day. Next thing you know, I\\'m in New York.\" within months, Jay found himself producing tracks for a who\\'s who of underground hip-hop: The Pharcyde, Busta Rhymes, De La Soul, Keith Murray, Mad Skillz, and of course A Tribe Called Quest.\\n\\n\"I was just riding the wave. It was still part of the dream to even be there. They even asked me creative questions about the album [Beats, Rhymes, and Life]. It\\'s just unbelievable, man! These are the three ultimate niggas to me. They sat me down and invited me to these meetings and I felt like I was a part of that shit. Whether the album did good or not, it was to me one of the best experiences of my life.\"\\n\\nUpon returning to Detroit, Jay found himself as the star of the city\\'s burgeoning hip hop scene. His beats were the conduit for a diverse crop of MC\\'s who gathered around the famed Hip Hop Shop, including Phat Kat, 5 Ela, Proof, Eminem, and a young Elzhi. His extended periods away from home had been difficult on Slum Village, but with Jay back in the fold and a renewed focus they set out to record their first album\\n\\n\"We decided to do that Fantastic album, and we did it in like two weeks. Everything was done. We were selling that shit out of boxes within a couple of weeks.\" Fan-tas-tic Vol. 1 became an underground classic, relentlessly dubbed and traded by fans in the days prior to file sharing. Innovative and playful, the album featured a string of hip hop classics including \"Players\", \"Look of Love\" and the brilliant James Brown adlib mash-up of \"I Don\\'t Know\".\\n\\nWhile his growing number of imitators were content to pick up the scraps of the fledgling neo-soul movement, Jay soon became the nucleus around which a group of like-minded, progressive artists would form, creating some of the best music to emerge from the post Golden-Age of early-nineties hip hop in the process. Dubbed the Soulquarians, Jay\\'s beats would provide the key inspiration for this eclectic group\\'s best work: The Roots\\' Things Fall Apart, D\\'Angelo\\'s Voodoo, Erykah Badu\\'s Mama\\'s Gun, Q-Tips\\'s Amplified, and Common\\'s Like Water for Chocolate.\\n\\nOriginally intended as a breakbeat record, Jay\\'s first solo album Welcome 2 Detroit provided the first opportunity to display his full range as a producer, MC, and vocalist. Seamlessly blending live instrumentation with programmed beats, W2D reflected his numerous influences and styles- from synth-heavy techno and grimy street anthems to breezy bossa nova. Stepping to the forefront as an MC for the first time, Jay introduced his alias J Dilla, and with it a more confident, street-edge rapper would emerge.\\n\\nAt a professional crossroads after a label deal with MCA collapsed in 2003, Dilla bypassed the mainstream altogether to unleash a flurry of new material: a collaborative album with Madlib entitled Champion Sound, and his own solo project the Ruff Draft EP, a muddy, lo-fi epic of uncompromising rawness. \"I did it in four or five days, turned it in and had wax in ten days. If I\\'m not doing beats for somebody, I make stuff for me to drive around and listen to, and that was one of those projects. I was just doing me. That\\'s why it was called the Ruff Draft EP\". \"There\\'d be days when I wouldn\\'t eat at all because I\\'d be in the basement working all day. Even after being in the hospital so long, I had to fight with the doctors [to go home] because being away from music was starting to get to me.\"\\n\\nDilla relocated to Los Angeles in 2004 to re-energize himself and focus on his career. But by the end of the year, he would again be hospitalized. Undergoing debilitating dialysis treatments 3-4 times a week, Dilla was bedridden for long periods of time causing his hands and legs to swell dramatically, making walking difficult without assistance. He lost 50% of his body weight. During this time he was diagnosed with Lupus, a debilitating blood disease which causes the immune system to attack healthy tissue and for which there is no cure. He was released from the hospital in March 2005, only to be readmitted later that summer. Using equipment set up in his hospital room, Dilla began work on what would become his masterpiece, Donuts, a sprawling, back-to-basics instrumental album filled with emotional, heartfelt testaments to life and mortality that brought him full-circle to his beginnings as young producer chopping up breakbeats.\\n\\nThat Fall, Dilla embarked on a European tour alongside his mother and friends, rapping to sold-out audiences from a wheelchair. It would be his final farewell to the fans who had shown their love and support for so long. Upon completion of the tour and another stay in the hospital, Dilla returned home. He handed off the masters for his still-unfinished solo LP The Shining in time for his upcoming birthday.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, February 7, 2006, his 32nd birthday, Donuts was released. He spent the day at home with friends and family. Three days later on February 10, James Dewitt Yancey passed away in the arms of his loving mother Maureen. He was put to rest the following week, on Valentine\\'s Day. As mourners gathered around his final resting place high in the hills of Los Angeles to say their goodbyes, a lone heart appeared in the cloudless sky above, fitting tribute for the man who above all else lived life to do what he loved. And what he loved, he did better than anybody else. For that, we will be forever thankful. Thank you Jay Dee.\\n\\nDiscography:\\nArtist/Group Releases (As Producer and/or MC):\\n1st Down - No Place to Go, 12\" single 1993\\n1st Down - A Day With the Homiez 12\", 12\" Single 1995 (Pay Day Records)\\nSlum Village - Fan-Tas-Tic 12\" single 1996\\nSlum Village - Fan-Tas-Tic Vol. 1 Album, 1996 (Donut Boy Recordings) 1997 (Sudden Impact) 2006 (Barak)\\nSlum Village - We Be Down, 12\" single 1997 (Sudden Impact)\\nJay Dee - Jay Dee Unreleased EP 1997 (House Shoes Records)\\nSlum Village - Somethin\\' For The People, All I Do (Remix) from \"All I Do 12\" single 1997 (WB)\\nJ-88 - Look Of Love (Remix) 12\" single 1999 (Groove Attack)\\nSlum Village - Get This Money, 12\" single 1999 (Interscope)\\nSlum Village - Fantastic, Vol. 2, Album 2000 (Goodvibe) 2002 (Capitol) 2010 (Barak)\\nSlum Village - Fall In Love (Remix), 12\" single (2000) (Goodvibe)\\nSlum Village - Climax/CB4, 12\" single 2000 (Goodvibe)\\nJ-88 - Best Kept Secret, EP 2000 (Groove Attack)\\nJay Dee - Fuck the Police, 12\" single 2001 (Up Above)\\nJay Dee - Pause, 12\" single 2001 (BBE)\\nJay Dee - Welcome 2 Detroit, Album 2001 (BBE)\\n1st Down - A Day With the Homiez, Album 2002 (RonnieCash.com)\\nJay Dee - Instrumental Series Vol. 1: Unreleased, EP 2002 (Bling47.com)\\nJay Dee feat.

Nurturing their son\\'s early passion for music, Jay was always enrolled in some kind of music class, excelling on the piano, violin and cello, before moving on to the drums. But it was the lure of the boom-bap which ultimately moved him from the church pews to the studio.\\n\\n\"When I heard Run-D.M.C.\\'s \"Sucker M.C.\\'s (Krush-Groove 1)\" and Whodini\\'s \"Big Mouth\", it made me curious to how the beats were made. Those songs were the first time I heard the beats that weren\\'t melodic - just drums. Being someone who was taking drum lessons at the time, that made me real curious. That led me into deejaying, which slowly led to me deejaying parties and that eventually led me into production.\"\\n\\nA fortuitous meeting with another talented Conant Gardens resident provided Jay with the direction necessary to pursue his dream. \"Fortunately I ran into this cat just walking in the street, literally. This guy named Amp Fiddler. He just called us out and from that first day he actually showed all of us how a studio works and things like that. He had a little pre-production studio in his crib. He was like, \\'Whenever you want to, come by the crib.\\' I started going over there messing with beats.\"Building on the experience he received at Amp\\'s studio, Jay was determined to form a group which reflected the eclectic nature of his influences. \"I heard about T3 and Baatin, and they were supposed to be the illest emcees at the time. And I thought I was, so I wanted to challenge them. To make a long story short, we just hooked up after that. The chemistry was right.\" Their group Slum Village gave Jay the platform to create a sound which was uniquely mid- western in its melding of jazzy, east coast influences with the glossy, bounce of west coast hip-hop. \\n\\nVia another timely assist from Amp Fiddler, Slum\\'s demo found it\\'s way into the hands of Q-Tip, who immediately recognized a kindred musical spirit in Jay and offered the young producer a management and production contract. \"It was like a dream come true, if you could ever, ever hear anybody say that. I just couldn\\'t believe it. I love Tribe and De La and then this guy Tip called my crib! Matter of fact, the first time he called, I wasn\\'t home. I missed the call! I was hurt. I thought that was it! But, he called me the next day. Next thing you know, I\\'m in New York.\" within months, Jay found himself producing tracks for a who\\'s who of underground hip-hop: The Pharcyde, Busta Rhymes, De La Soul, Keith Murray, Mad Skillz, and of course A Tribe Called Quest.\\n\\n\"I was just riding the wave. It was still part of the dream to even be there. They even asked me creative questions about the album [Beats, Rhymes, and Life]. It\\'s just unbelievable, man! These are the three ultimate niggas to me. They sat me down and invited me to these meetings and I felt like I was a part of that shit. Whether the album did good or not, it was to me one of the best experiences of my life.\"\\n\\nUpon returning to Detroit, Jay found himself as the star of the city\\'s burgeoning hip hop scene. His beats were the conduit for a diverse crop of MC\\'s who gathered around the famed Hip Hop Shop, including Phat Kat, 5 Ela, Proof, Eminem, and a young Elzhi. His extended periods away from home had been difficult on Slum Village, but with Jay back in the fold and a renewed focus they set out to record their first album\\n\\n\"We decided to do that Fantastic album, and we did it in like two weeks. Everything was done. We were selling that shit out of boxes within a couple of weeks.\" Fan-tas-tic Vol. 1 became an underground classic, relentlessly dubbed and traded by fans in the days prior to file sharing. Innovative and playful, the album featured a string of hip hop classics including \"Players\", \"Look of Love\" and the brilliant James Brown adlib mash-up of \"I Don\\'t Know\".\\n\\nWhile his growing number of imitators were content to pick up the scraps of the fledgling neo-soul movement, Jay soon became the nucleus around which a group of like-minded, progressive artists would form, creating some of the best music to emerge from the post Golden-Age of early-nineties hip hop in the process. Dubbed the Soulquarians, Jay\\'s beats would provide the key inspiration for this eclectic group\\'s best work: The Roots\\' Things Fall Apart, D\\'Angelo\\'s Voodoo, Erykah Badu\\'s Mama\\'s Gun, Q-Tips\\'s Amplified, and Common\\'s Like Water for Chocolate.\\n\\nOriginally intended as a breakbeat record, Jay\\'s first solo album Welcome 2 Detroit provided the first opportunity to display his full range as a producer, MC, and vocalist. Seamlessly blending live instrumentation with programmed beats, W2D reflected his numerous influences and styles- from synth-heavy techno and grimy street anthems to breezy bossa nova. Stepping to the forefront as an MC for the first time, Jay introduced his alias J Dilla, and with it a more confident, street-edge rapper would emerge.\\n\\nAt a professional crossroads after a label deal with MCA collapsed in 2003, Dilla bypassed the mainstream altogether to unleash a flurry of new material: a collaborative album with Madlib entitled Champion Sound, and his own solo project the Ruff Draft EP, a muddy, lo-fi epic of uncompromising rawness. \"I did it in four or five days, turned it in and had wax in ten days. If I\\'m not doing beats for somebody, I make stuff for me to drive around and listen to, and that was one of those projects. I was just doing me. That\\'s why it was called the Ruff Draft EP\". \"There\\'d be days when I wouldn\\'t eat at all because I\\'d be in the basement working all day. Even after being in the hospital so long, I had to fight with the doctors [to go home] because being away from music was starting to get to me.\"\\n\\nDilla relocated to Los Angeles in 2004 to re-energize himself and focus on his career. But by the end of the year, he would again be hospitalized. Undergoing debilitating dialysis treatments 3-4 times a week, Dilla was bedridden for long periods of time causing his hands and legs to swell dramatically, making walking difficult without assistance. He lost 50% of his body weight. During this time he was diagnosed with Lupus, a debilitating blood disease which causes the immune system to attack healthy tissue and for which there is no cure. He was released from the hospital in March 2005, only to be readmitted later that summer. Using equipment set up in his hospital room, Dilla began work on what would become his masterpiece, Donuts, a sprawling, back-to-basics instrumental album filled with emotional, heartfelt testaments to life and mortality that brought him full-circle to his beginnings as young producer chopping up breakbeats.\\n\\nThat Fall, Dilla embarked on a European tour alongside his mother and friends, rapping to sold-out audiences from a wheelchair. It would be his final farewell to the fans who had shown their love and support for so long. Upon completion of the tour and another stay in the hospital, Dilla returned home. He handed off the masters for his still-unfinished solo LP The Shining in time for his upcoming birthday.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, February 7, 2006, his 32nd birthday, Donuts was released. He spent the day at home with friends and family. Three days later on February 10, James Dewitt Yancey passed away in the arms of his loving mother Maureen. He was put to rest the following week, on Valentine\\'s Day. As mourners gathered around his final resting place high in the hills of Los Angeles to say their goodbyes, a lone heart appeared in the cloudless sky above, fitting tribute for the man who above all else lived life to do what he loved. And what he loved, he did better than anybody else. For that, we will be forever thankful. Thank you Jay Dee.\\n\\nDiscography:\\nArtist/Group Releases (As Producer and/or MC):\\n1st Down - No Place to Go, 12\" single 1993\\n1st Down - A Day With the Homiez 12\", 12\" Single 1995 (Pay Day Records)\\nSlum Village - Fan-Tas-Tic 12\" single 1996\\nSlum Village - Fan-Tas-Tic Vol. 1 Album, 1996 (Donut Boy Recordings) 1997 (Sudden Impact) 2006 (Barak)\\nSlum Village - We Be Down, 12\" single 1997 (Sudden Impact)\\nJay Dee - Jay Dee Unreleased EP 1997 (House Shoes Records)\\nSlum Village - Somethin\\' For The People, All I Do (Remix) from \"All I Do 12\" single 1997 (WB)\\nJ-88 - Look Of Love (Remix) 12\" single 1999 (Groove Attack)\\nSlum Village - Get This Money, 12\" single 1999 (Interscope)\\nSlum Village - Fantastic, Vol. 2, Album 2000 (Goodvibe) 2002 (Capitol) 2010 (Barak)\\nSlum Village - Fall In Love (Remix), 12\" single (2000) (Goodvibe)\\nSlum Village - Climax/CB4, 12\" single 2000 (Goodvibe)\\nJ-88 - Best Kept Secret, EP 2000 (Groove Attack)\\nJay Dee - Fuck the Police, 12\" single 2001 (Up Above)\\nJay Dee - Pause, 12\" single 2001 (BBE)\\nJay Dee - Welcome 2 Detroit, Album 2001 (BBE)\\n1st Down - A Day With the Homiez, Album 2002 (RonnieCash.com)\\nJay Dee - Instrumental Series Vol. 1: Unreleased, EP 2002 (Bling47.com)\\nJay Dee feat.

      "biography_en": "James Dewitt Yancey (February 7, 1974-February 10, 2006), better known as J Dilla or Jay Dee, was an acclaimed hip-Hop producer who emerged from the mid-1990s underground Hip-Hop scene in Detroit, Michigan. He began his career as a member of the group Slum Village, and was also a driving force in the production trio The Ummah. Yancey started his career under the name Jay Dee (based on his initials) but used the name J Dilla from 2001 onward. Many critics believe J Dilla's work to have had a major influence on his peers and that he embodied the neo soul sound, playing a defining yet understated role during the sub-genre's rise (roughly from the mid-90s to the early 2000s). J Dilla was often dubbed \"your favorite producer's favorite producer,\" and was highly regarded by hip hop artists and producers such as Royce Da 5'9\", Common, Kanye West, A Tribe Called Quest, Just Blaze, Busta Rhymes, Pharrell Williams, Madlib, The Pharcyde, Slum Village and ?uestlove.",

      "profile": "American hip hop DJ/producer. \r\n\r\nBorn: 7 February 1974 in Detroit, Michigan, USA. \r\nDied: 10 February 2006 in Los Angeles, California, USA (aged 32). \r\n\r\nJames Dewitt Yancey, better known by his stage name J Dilla or Jay Dee, was an American record producer who emerged from the mid-1990s underground hip-hop scene in Detroit, Michigan. \r\n\r\nHe began his career as a member of the group [a=Slum Village], and made his name with [a=Common], [a=A Tribe Called Quest], and as [a=Jaylib] in which he collaborated with [a=Madlib]. He was also a member of the production team trio [url=https://www.discogs.com/fr/artist/56441-The-Ummah]The Ummah[/url] with [a=Q-Tip] and [a=Ali Shaheed Muhammad]. \r\n\r\nHe started his career under the name Jay Dee (based on his initials) but used the name J Dilla from 2001 onward. Many critics believe his work to have had a major influence on his peers and that he embodied the neo-soul sound, playing a defining yet understated role during the sub-genre's rise (roughly from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s). LA-based producer and MC, Madlib, began collaborating with J Dilla, and the pair formed the group Jaylib in 2002, releasing an album called \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Jaylib-Champion-Sound/master/124462]Champion Sound[/url]\" in 2003. After J Dilla relocated from Detroit to LA in 2004, they toured as Jaylib in Spring 2004. \r\n\r\nHe moved from his native Detroit to Los Angeles to live with his mother after being diagnosed in 2003. \r\nIt was later revealed that he suffered from TTP, a rare blood disease, and Lupus, affecting the immune-system. J Dilla's illness and medication caused dramatic weight loss from 2003 onwards, forcing him to publicly confirm speculation about his health in 2004. Despite a slower output of major releases and production credits in 2004-2005, his cult status remained strong within his core audience, as evident by unauthorized circulation of his underground \"beat tapes\" (instrumental, and raw working materials), mostly through internet file sharing. Articles in music publications URB (March 2004) and XXL (June 2005) confirmed rumors of ill health and hospitalization during this period, but these were downplayed by J himself. The seriousness of his condition became public in November 2005 when J Dilla toured Europe performing from a wheelchair. \r\n\r\nHis last album released during his lifetime, \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/J-Dilla-Donuts/master/68208]Donuts[/url]\", was released on [l=Stones Throw Records] on 7 Feb 2006, Dilla's 32nd birthday, and the first one in years he didn't spend in hospital. Three days later, on 10 February 2006, he died at his home in LA. According to his mother, [a977167], the cause was cardiac arrest. \r\n\r\nThe founding of the James Dewitt Yancey Foundation was announced in May 2006 by his mother [a977167], to honour her son's legacy and to help raise awareness and funding for Lupus research by organising continued events to aid underprivileged children gain quality arts training, primarily in the field of music. \r\n\r\nHe is brother to [a=Illa J] and his father was [a9207571]\r\n",

        "profile": "American hip hop DJ/producer. \r\n\r\nBorn: 7 February 1974 in Detroit, Michigan, USA. \r\nDied: 10 February 2006 in Los Angeles, California, USA (aged 32). \r\n\r\nJames Dewitt Yancey, better known by his stage name J Dilla or Jay Dee, was an American record producer who emerged from the mid-1990s underground hip-hop scene in Detroit, Michigan. \r\n\r\nHe began his career as a member of the group [a=Slum Village], and made his name with [a=Common], [a=A Tribe Called Quest], and as [a=Jaylib] in which he collaborated with [a=Madlib]. He was also a member of the production team trio [url=https://www.discogs.com/fr/artist/56441-The-Ummah]The Ummah[/url] with [a=Q-Tip] and [a=Ali Shaheed Muhammad]. \r\n\r\nHe started his career under the name Jay Dee (based on his initials) but used the name J Dilla from 2001 onward. Many critics believe his work to have had a major influence on his peers and that he embodied the neo-soul sound, playing a defining yet understated role during the sub-genre's rise (roughly from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s). LA-based producer and MC, Madlib, began collaborating with J Dilla, and the pair formed the group Jaylib in 2002, releasing an album called \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Jaylib-Champion-Sound/master/124462]Champion Sound[/url]\" in 2003. After J Dilla relocated from Detroit to LA in 2004, they toured as Jaylib in Spring 2004. \r\n\r\nHe moved from his native Detroit to Los Angeles to live with his mother after being diagnosed in 2003. \r\nIt was later revealed that he suffered from TTP, a rare blood disease, and Lupus, affecting the immune-system. J Dilla's illness and medication caused dramatic weight loss from 2003 onwards, forcing him to publicly confirm speculation about his health in 2004. Despite a slower output of major releases and production credits in 2004-2005, his cult status remained strong within his core audience, as evident by unauthorized circulation of his underground \"beat tapes\" (instrumental, and raw working materials), mostly through internet file sharing. Articles in music publications URB (March 2004) and XXL (June 2005) confirmed rumors of ill health and hospitalization during this period, but these were downplayed by J himself. The seriousness of his condition became public in November 2005 when J Dilla toured Europe performing from a wheelchair. \r\n\r\nHis last album released during his lifetime, \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/J-Dilla-Donuts/master/68208]Donuts[/url]\", was released on [l=Stones Throw Records] on 7 Feb 2006, Dilla's 32nd birthday, and the first one in years he didn't spend in hospital. Three days later, on 10 February 2006, he died at his home in LA. According to his mother, [a977167], the cause was cardiac arrest. \r\n\r\nThe founding of the James Dewitt Yancey Foundation was announced in May 2006 by his mother [a977167], to honour her son's legacy and to help raise awareness and funding for Lupus research by organising continued events to aid underprivileged children gain quality arts training, primarily in the field of music. \r\n\r\nHe is brother to [a=Illa J] and his father was [a9207571]\r\n",

      "bio_content": "NOTE: Dilla (German pop) and J Dilla share an artist profile because of the shared name.\n\nJ Dilla was born James Dewitt Yancey on February 7, 1974 in Detroit, Michigan, to Maureen and Beverly Yancey. From the onset, music was intrinsic to Jay's life. His mother Maureen was an accomplished singer and lover of classical music and opera. His father Beverly was a gifted vocalist and bass player fond of vocal harmonies and jazz, who played professionally for 25 years before taking a job at Ford. A two-year-old Jay would gurgle along in perfect pitch to the sound of his father practicing on his upright bass until it lulled him to sleep.\n\nEspecially aware of the dangers that faced unoccupied youths growing up in their Detroit neighborhood of Conant Gardens, the Yancey's set out to keep their children as busy as possible between cub scouts, music lessons, youth choir, and any other church activities. Nurturing their son's early passion for music, Jay was always enrolled in some kind of music class, excelling on the piano, violin and cello, before moving on to the drums. But it was the lure of the boom-bap which ultimately moved him from the church pews to the studio.\n\n\"When I heard Run-D.M.C.'s \"Sucker M.C.'s (Krush-Groove 1)\" and Whodini's \"Big Mouth\", it made me curious to how the beats were made. Those songs were the first time I heard the beats that weren't melodic - just drums. Being someone who was taking drum lessons at the time, that made me real curious. That led me into deejaying, which slowly led to me deejaying parties and that eventually led me into production.\"\n\nA fortuitous meeting with another talented Conant Gardens resident provided Jay with the direction necessary to pursue his dream. \"Fortunately I ran into this cat just walking in the street, literally. This guy named Amp Fiddler. He just called us out and from that first day he actually showed all of us how a studio works and things like that. He had a little pre-production studio in his crib. He was like, 'Whenever you want to, come by the crib.' I started going over there messing with beats.\"Building on the experience he received at Amp's studio, Jay was determined to form a group which reflected the eclectic nature of his influences. \"I heard about T3 and Baatin, and they were supposed to be the illest emcees at the time. And I thought I was, so I wanted to challenge them. To make a long story short, we just hooked up after that. The chemistry was right.\" Their group Slum Village gave Jay the platform to create a sound which was uniquely mid- western in its melding of jazzy, east coast influences with the glossy, bounce of west coast hip-hop. \n\nVia another timely assist from Amp Fiddler, Slum's demo found it's way into the hands of Q-Tip, who immediately recognized a kindred musical spirit in Jay and offered the young producer a management and production contract. \"It was like a dream come true, if you could ever, ever hear anybody say that. I just couldn't believe it. I love Tribe and De La and then this guy Tip called my crib! Matter of fact, the first time he called, I wasn't home. I missed the call! I was hurt. I thought that was it! But, he called me the next day. Next thing you know, I'm in New York.\" within months, Jay found himself producing tracks for a who's who of underground hip-hop: The Pharcyde, Busta Rhymes, De La Soul, Keith Murray, Mad Skillz, and of course A Tribe Called Quest.\n\n\"I was just riding the wave. It was still part of the dream to even be there. They even asked me creative questions about the album [Beats, Rhymes, and Life]. It's just unbelievable, man! These are the three ultimate niggas to me. They sat me down and invited me to these meetings and I felt like I was a part of that shit. Whether the album did good or not, it was to me one of the best experiences of my life.\"\n\nUpon returning to Detroit, Jay found himself as the star of the city's burgeoning hip hop scene. His beats were the conduit for a diverse crop of MC's who gathered around the famed Hip Hop Shop, including Phat Kat, 5 Ela, Proof, Eminem, and a young Elzhi. His extended periods away from home had been difficult on Slum Village, but with Jay back in the fold and a renewed focus they set out to record their first album\n\n\"We decided to do that Fantastic album, and we did it in like two weeks. Everything was done. We were selling that shit out of boxes within a couple of weeks.\" Fan-tas-tic Vol. 1 became an underground classic, relentlessly dubbed and traded by fans in the days prior to file sharing. Innovative and playful, the album featured a string of hip hop classics including \"Players\", \"Look of Love\" and the brilliant James Brown adlib mash-up of \"I Don't Know\".\n\nWhile his growing number of imitators were content to pick up the scraps of the fledgling neo-soul movement, Jay soon became the nucleus around which a group of like-minded, progressive artists would form, creating some of the best music to emerge from the post Golden-Age of early-nineties hip hop in the process. Dubbed the Soulquarians, Jay's beats would provide the key inspiration for this eclectic group's best work: The Roots' Things Fall Apart, D'Angelo's Voodoo, Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun, Q-Tips's Amplified, and Common's Like Water for Chocolate.\n\nOriginally intended as a breakbeat record, Jay's first solo album Welcome 2 Detroit provided the first opportunity to display his full range as a producer, MC, and vocalist. Seamlessly blending live instrumentation with programmed beats, W2D reflected his numerous influences and styles- from synth-heavy techno and grimy street anthems to breezy bossa nova. Stepping to the forefront as an MC for the first time, Jay introduced his alias J Dilla, and with it a more confident, street-edge rapper would emerge.\n\nAt a professional crossroads after a label deal with MCA collapsed in 2003, Dilla bypassed the mainstream altogether to unleash a flurry of new material: a collaborative album with Madlib entitled Champion Sound, and his own solo project the Ruff Draft EP, a muddy, lo-fi epic of uncompromising rawness. \"I did it in four or five days, turned it in and had wax in ten days. If I'm not doing beats for somebody, I make stuff for me to drive around and listen to, and that was one of those projects. I was just doing me. That's why it was called the Ruff Draft EP\". \"There'd be days when I wouldn't eat at all because I'd be in the basement working all day. Even after being in the hospital so long, I had to fight with the doctors [to go home] because being away from music was starting to get to me.\"\n\nDilla relocated to Los Angeles in 2004 to re-energize himself and focus on his career. But by the end of the year, he would again be hospitalized. Undergoing debilitating dialysis treatments 3-4 times a week, Dilla was bedridden for long periods of time causing his hands and legs to swell dramatically, making walking difficult without assistance. He lost 50% of his body weight. During this time he was diagnosed with Lupus, a debilitating blood disease which causes the immune system to attack healthy tissue and for which there is no cure. He was released from the hospital in March 2005, only to be readmitted later that summer. Using equipment set up in his hospital room, Dilla began work on what would become his masterpiece, Donuts, a sprawling, back-to-basics instrumental album filled with emotional, heartfelt testaments to life and mortality that brought him full-circle to his beginnings as young producer chopping up breakbeats.\n\nThat Fall, Dilla embarked on a European tour alongside his mother and friends, rapping to sold-out audiences from a wheelchair. It would be his final farewell to the fans who had shown their love and support for so long. Upon completion of the tour and another stay in the hospital, Dilla returned home. He handed off the masters for his still-unfinished solo LP The Shining in time for his upcoming birthday.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 7, 2006, his 32nd birthday, Donuts was released. He spent the day at home with friends and family. Three days later on February 10, James Dewitt Yancey passed away in the arms of his loving mother Maureen. He was put to rest the following week, on Valentine's Day. As mourners gathered around his final resting place high in the hills of Los Angeles to say their goodbyes, a lone heart appeared in the cloudless sky above, fitting tribute for the man who above all else lived life to do what he loved. And what he loved, he did better than anybody else. For that, we will be forever thankful. Thank you Jay Dee.\n\nDiscography:\nArtist/Group Releases (As Producer and/or MC):\n1st Down - No Place to Go, 12\" single 1993\n1st Down - A Day With the Homiez 12\", 12\" Single 1995 (Pay Day Records)\nSlum Village - Fan-Tas-Tic 12\" single 1996\nSlum Village - Fan-Tas-Tic Vol. 1 Album, 1996 (Donut Boy Recordings) 1997 (Sudden Impact) 2006 (Barak)\nSlum Village - We Be Down, 12\" single 1997 (Sudden Impact)\nJay Dee - Jay Dee Unreleased EP 1997 (House Shoes Records)\nSlum Village - Somethin' For The People, All I Do (Remix) from \"All I Do 12\" single 1997 (WB)\nJ-88 - Look Of Love (Remix) 12\" single 1999 (Groove Attack)\nSlum Village - Get This Money, 12\" single 1999 (Interscope)\nSlum Village - Fantastic, Vol. 2, Album 2000 (Goodvibe) 2002 (Capitol) 2010 (Barak)\nSlum Village - Fall In Love (Remix), 12\" single (2000) (Goodvibe)\nSlum Village - Climax/CB4, 12\" single 2000 (Goodvibe)\nJ-88 - Best Kept Secret, EP 2000 (Groove Attack)\nJay Dee - Fuck the Police, 12\" single 2001 (Up Above)\nJay Dee - Pause, 12\" single 2001 (BBE)\nJay Dee - Welcome 2 Detroit, Album 2001 (BBE)\n1st Down - A Day With the Homiez, Album 2002 (RonnieCash.com)\nJay Dee - Instrumental Series Vol. 1: Unreleased, EP 2002 (Bling47.com)\nJay Dee feat.

      "biography_en": "James Dewitt Yancey (February 7, 1974-February 10, 2006), better known as J Dilla or Jay Dee, was an acclaimed hip-Hop producer who emerged from the mid-1990s underground Hip-Hop scene in Detroit, Michigan. He began his career as a member of the group Slum Village, and was also a driving force in the production trio The Ummah. Yancey started his career under the name Jay Dee (based on his initials) but used the name J Dilla from 2001 onward. Many critics believe J Dilla's work to have had a major influence on his peers and that he embodied the neo soul sound, playing a defining yet understated role during the sub-genre's rise (roughly from the mid-90s to the early 2000s). J Dilla was often dubbed \"your favorite producer's favorite producer,\" and was highly regarded by hip hop artists and producers such as Royce Da 5'9\", Common, Kanye West, A Tribe Called Quest, Just Blaze, Busta Rhymes, Pharrell Williams, Madlib, The Pharcyde, Slum Village and ?uestlove.",
