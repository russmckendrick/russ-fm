      "biography": "Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band primarily consisted of Ian Curtis (vocals and occasional guitar), Bernard Sumner (guitar and keyboards), Peter Hook (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Stephen Morris (drums and percussion).\nJoy Division rapidly evolved from their initial punk rock influences to develop a sound and style that pioneered the post-punk movement of the late 1970s. According to music critic Jon Savage, the band \"were not punk but were directly inspired by its energy\". Their self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, caught the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson. Joy Division's debut album, Unknown Pleasures, was released in 1979 on Wilson's independent record label, Factory Records, and drew critical acclaim from the British press. Despite the band's growing success, vocalist Ian Curtis was beset with depression and personal difficulties, including a dissolving marriage and his diagnosis of epilepsy. Curtis found it increasingly difficult to perform at live concerts, and often had seizures during performances.\nOn the eve of the band's first American tour in May 1980, Curtis committed suicide. Joy Division's posthumously released second album, Closer (1980), and the single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became the band's highest charting releases. After the death of Curtis, the remaining members continued as New Order, achieving critical and commercial success.",

      "editorial_notes": "You don’t always know when you’ve made a masterpiece. In April 1979, Joy Division—singer Ian Curtis, bassist Peter Hook, drummer Stephen Morris and guitarist Bernard Sumner—convened at Strawberry Studios in Stockport with producer Martin Hannett. Three weeks later, they’d recorded an enormously influential cultural landmark. However, Hook and Sumner in particular were unconvinced. Hannett’s singular, haunting vision for their music was in keeping with the bleak melodrama of Curtis’ lyrics, but some of the punk intensity of their live shows had been lost. “Martin had definitely toned down—or twisted—the rawness into another kind of rawness,” Morris tells Apple Music. “It wasn’t amped up. Martin gave the music a depth and put it in a setting that it was made for. It was just a setting that we'd never imagined our music being in, so it was like, ‘Wurgh, what have you done?’” What they had done was create 10 songs whose frostbitten grandeur, minimalist aesthetic and unflinching introspection continue to manifest themselves in literature and cinema and on catwalks as well as countless dark-souled indie, synth-pop and goth bands. To get there, Hannett’s eccentric methods included messing with the studio heating so that the band regularly suffered extreme temperatures and ordering Morris to completely disassemble his drum kit and play the parts separately. Here, Morris takes us track by track through a process of isolation, very few choruses and an experiment that almost destroyed the studio in a fireball.<br />\n<b>“Disorder”</b>\n“Quite a frantic song. The three songs that should never be played together are ‘Disorder’, ‘Interzone’ and ‘Transmission’ because I collapse at the end. So of course that happened quite a lot. I really liked the lyrics. Going in the studio was really the first time that we'd been able to hear them properly. Before then, the only bit that I was certain about was the spirit/feeling bit [‘I’ve got the spirit but lose the feeling’].”<br />\n<b>“Day of the Lords”</b>\n“I always think of ‘Day of the Lords’ and ‘I Remember Nothing’ as a pair. They've both got that iciness, but they're both nail-you-to-the-wall numbers. We did it in an afternoon probably. We were doing it in isolation, cut off from the rest of the Manchester music scene. We had this nobody-would-give-us-a-gig thing, so we were just stuck in the rehearsal room, writing songs: ‘Well, this will show them—we'll write the best song ever.’ We certainly didn't think that what we were doing was going to be something that would stand out 40 years later, at all.”<br />\n<b>“Candidate”</b>\n“This was made up pretty much on the spot. We were sound-checking the drums and bass, jamming with Hooky, and Martin recorded it. Ian went away and wrote the words pretty quickly. He got ideas from films and TV as well as books. I can't remember what the film was, it might have been <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>—there's someone in that who gets assassinated. I think that's where the title came from.”<br />\n<b>“Insight”</b>\n“This has my first drum synthesiser sound. I discovered that if you turned the filter knob right up, you could turn it into the sound of a <i>Star Wars</i> Imperial Stormtrooper laser battle, which was always a highlight live. I didn't understand that the volume increased exponentially as you turned the knob up, so when we did the break, it was deafeningly loud. It’s another typical Joy Division song in that it doesn't really have a chorus. It’s just two moods—it goes from quite reflective to very, very sort of angry, then back to being reflective. Ian’s lyrics are absolutely perfect. We knew this one definitely didn't sound like anything else, and again, it just arrived one Sunday afternoon.”<br />\n<b>“New Dawn Fades”</b>\n“I remember thinking, ‘Oh god, this is really, really fantastic.’ And then, yeah… Martin accidentally erased the cymbals. I am absolutely amazed at how the album still sounds modern. We were very interested in the future, but we weren't aware that what we were doing was something that would end up there.”<br />\n<b>“She’s Lost Control”</b>\n“The version on <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> is pretty much the same as we'd been doing it live, but after that we got taken with the idea of a 12-inch disco remix. In order to embellish the drum synth rhythm on it, Martin sent me into the tiny vocal booth to spray tape head cleaner in time to the drums. I think we went through two tins in half an hour. I should really have noticed the picture of the flames on the side of the can—it was highly inflammable. When we'd finished, I was going to light a cigarette, but fortunately [manager] Rob Gretton had run off with my lighter. Otherwise the whole thing would have just gone bang.”<br />\n<b>“Shadowplay”</b>\n“This always reminded me of ‘Ocean’, the Velvet Underground/Lou Reed song. Ian's lyrics are fantastic, a science fiction landscape thing. I remember listening to it for the first time, you could see this place, like out of a J.G. Ballard book. I’ve always played it exactly the same, because it's just like a reflex action, a muscle memory thing. But the other day I sat down and tried to work out what the hell I was playing, and it's like... God, you would never really play that. It was just a reaction to what everybody else was playing, and when I tried to analyse it, I just got lost.”<br />\n<b>“Wilderness”</b>\n“The stop-start-y one. I can remember Ian going on about an old ’60s black-and-white film about pirates who get marooned in the Sargasso Sea and cross the ocean with balloons on their feet… This sounds like I'm making this up, like some sort of psychedelic nightmare I once had. It was the idea that these people were just sort of stranded somewhere, and I think Ian got some lyrical inspiration from it. It's a very peculiar song, very unusual rhythmically: I had one more drum than was strictly necessary for a drum kit, and I couldn't figure what to do with it, so I wrote a pattern using this drum which otherwise would never get hit.”<br />\n<b>“Interzone”</b>\n“We all wanted to do something that was a bit like ‘The Murder Mystery’ on the third Velvet Underground album. Two lots of vocals going on; one's on one side and one's on the other side of the stereo. Ian wrote two lots of lyrics for it. He's singing one and Hooky's singing the other. In the end, when Ian's epilepsy became really bad, ‘Interzone’ became the song that we had to do because Ian couldn't sing anymore, Hooky could sing it.”<br />\n<b>“I Remember Nothing”</b>\n“This was probably the biggest step that we took on our own into technology. Bernard had brought the Transcendent kit synthesiser, which he made himself, and Rob and Ian had this idea that we should do this jam—unimaginatively called ‘The Synthesiser One’—at the end of the [live] set. It’s a brooding thing, it's malevolence in a tune. It was the beginning of Ian turning into a singer/guitarist, because when we did it live, Bernard would have to play the synth. Ian wouldn't go near the synth: He was frightened he’d break it.”",

I didn't understand that the volume increased exponentially as you turned the knob up, so when we did the break, it was deafeningly loud. It’s another typical Joy Division song in that it doesn't really have a chorus. It’s just two moods—it goes from quite reflective to very, very sort of angry, then back to being reflective. Ian’s lyrics are absolutely perfect. We knew this one definitely didn't sound like anything else, and again, it just arrived one Sunday afternoon.”<br />\n<b>“New Dawn Fades”</b>\n“I remember thinking, ‘Oh god, this is really, really fantastic.’ And then, yeah… Martin accidentally erased the cymbals. I am absolutely amazed at how the album still sounds modern. We were very interested in the future, but we weren't aware that what we were doing was something that would end up there.”<br />\n<b>“She’s Lost Control”</b>\n“The version on <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> is pretty much the same as we'd been doing it live, but after that we got taken with the idea of a 12-inch disco remix. In order to embellish the drum synth rhythm on it, Martin sent me into the tiny vocal booth to spray tape head cleaner in time to the drums. I think we went through two tins in half an hour. I should really have noticed the picture of the flames on the side of the can—it was highly inflammable. When we'd finished, I was going to light a cigarette, but fortunately [manager] Rob Gretton had run off with my lighter. Otherwise the whole thing would have just gone bang.”<br />\n<b>“Shadowplay”</b>\n“This always reminded me of ‘Ocean’, the Velvet Underground/Lou Reed song. Ian's lyrics are fantastic, a science fiction landscape thing. I remember listening to it for the first time, you could see this place, like out of a J.G. Ballard book. I’ve always played it exactly the same, because it's just like a reflex action, a muscle memory thing. But the other day I sat down and tried to work out what the hell I was playing, and it's like... God, you would never really play that. It was just a reaction to what everybody else was playing, and when I tried to analyse it, I just got lost.”<br />\n<b>“Wilderness”</b>\n“The stop-start-y one. I can remember Ian going on about an old ’60s black-and-white film about pirates who get marooned in the Sargasso Sea and cross the ocean with balloons on their feet… This sounds like I'm making this up, like some sort of psychedelic nightmare I once had. It was the idea that these people were just sort of stranded somewhere, and I think Ian got some lyrical inspiration from it. It's a very peculiar song, very unusual rhythmically: I had one more drum than was strictly necessary for a drum kit, and I couldn't figure what to do with it, so I wrote a pattern using this drum which otherwise would never get hit.”<br />\n<b>“Interzone”</b>\n“We all wanted to do something that was a bit like ‘The Murder Mystery’ on the third Velvet Underground album. Two lots of vocals going on; one's on one side and one's on the other side of the stereo. Ian wrote two lots of lyrics for it. He's singing one and Hooky's singing the other. In the end, when Ian's epilepsy became really bad, ‘Interzone’ became the song that we had to do because Ian couldn't sing anymore, Hooky could sing it.”<br />\n<b>“I Remember Nothing”</b>\n“This was probably the biggest step that we took on our own into technology. Bernard had brought the Transcendent kit synthesiser, which he made himself, and Rob and Ian had this idea that we should do this jam—unimaginatively called ‘The Synthesiser One’—at the end of the [live] set. It’s a brooding thing, it's malevolence in a tune. It was the beginning of Ian turning into a singer/guitarist, because when we did it live, Bernard would have to play the synth. Ian wouldn't go near the synth: He was frightened he’d break it.”"

            "content": "Unknown Pleasures is the debut studio album by English rock band Joy Division, released on 15 June 1979 on Tony Wilson's Factory Records. It followed an abandoned session for RCA Records, and was recorded and mixed over three weekends at Strawberry Studios, Stockport in April 1979 with record producer Martin Hannett. The cover artwork was designed by artist Peter Saville.\n\nFactory did not release any singles from the album, and it did not chart despite the relative success of the group's non-album debut single \"Transmission\". Unknown Pleasures has gone on to receive sustained critical acclaim as a pioneering and influential post-punk album. It has been named as one of the best albums ever by publications such as NME, AllMusic, and Select.\n\nUnknown Pleasures was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport over three weekends between 1 and 17 April 1979, with Martin Hannett producing. Describing Hannett's production techniques, Hook said, \" didn't think straight, he thought sideways. He confused you and made you do something you didn't expect.\" Hook went on to say, \"Derek Bramwood of Strawberry Studios said that you can take a group that have got on brilliantly for 20 years, put them in a studio with Martin and within five minutes, they'll be trying to slash each other's throats.\" However, Hook went on to say that Hannett was only as good as the material he had to work with, \"We gave him great songs, and like a top chef, he added some salt and pepper and some herbs and served up the dish. But he needed our ingredients.\"\n\nHannett used a number of unusual sound effects and production techniques on the album; including the sound of a bottle smashing, someone eating crisps, backwards guitar and the sound of the Strawberry Studios lift with a Leslie speaker \"whirring inside\". He also used the sound of a basement toilet, as well as several AMS 15-80s digital delays and a couple of Marshall Time Modulators, tape echo and bounce. Hannett recorded Curtis's vocals for \"Insight\" down a telephone line so he could achieve the \"requisite distance\". Referring to the recording sessions, Hook remembered, \"Sumner started using a kit-built Powertran Transcendent 2000 synthesiser, most notably on 'I Remember Nothing', where it vied with the sound of Rob Gretton smashing bottles with Steve and his Walther replica pistol.\" In his words, \"Morris ... had invested in a syndrum because he thought he saw one on the cover of Can's Tago Mago: \"you triggered it by hitting it.  frowned on it because he wasn't the one doing the triggering.\"\n\nThe band members' opinions differed on the \"spacious, atmospheric sound\" of the album, which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound. Sumner said, \"The music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars. The production inflicted this dark, doomy mood over the album: we'd drawn this picture in black and white, and Martin had coloured it in for us. We resented it ...\" Hook said, \"I couldn't hide my disappointment then, it sounded like Pink Floyd.\" Morris disagreed, saying, \"I was happy with Unknown Pleasures. My theory on things at the time was that the two things—listening to a record and going to a gig—were quite different. You don't want to hear a record when you go to a gig: you want something with a bit of energy.\" Curtis was also happy with the production of the album and was impressed with Hannett's work. Hook conceded in 2006, \"It definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it ... But now I can see that Martin did a good job on it ... There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound.\" Hook also noted that he was able to hear Curtis's lyrics and Sumner's guitar parts for the first time on the record, because during gigs the band played too loudly.\n\nIn 1994, Jon Savage described the music as \"a definitive Northern Gothic statement: guilt-ridden, romantic, claustrophobic\". Analysing Curtis's work, music journalist Richard Cook remarked in 1983: \"sex has disappeared from these unknown pleasures; it is an aftermath of passion where everything's (perhaps) lost\".\n\nPeter Saville, who had previously designed posters for Manchester's Factory club in 1978, designed the cover of the album. Sumner chose the image used on the cover, which is based on an image of radio waves from pulsar CP 1919, from The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. Saville reversed the image from black-on-white to white-on-black and printed it on textured card for the original version of the album. It is not a Fourier analysis, but rather an image of the intensity of successive radio pulses, as stated in the Cambridge Encyclopaedia. The image was originally created by radio astronomer Harold Craft at the Arecibo Observatory for his 1970 PhD thesis.\n\nThis image became well-known, featuring on T-shirts (even parodied by a quickly-withdrawn Disney shirt). When reviewing the 2007 remastered version of Unknown Pleasures, Pitchfork critic Joshua Klein described the cover art as \"iconic\". Susie Goldring, reviewing the album for BBC Online said, \"The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes. Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will.\"\n\nThe inner sleeve features a black-and-white photograph of a door with a hand near the handle. It was some years later before Saville discovered that the photograph was Hand Through a Doorway, a well-known picture by Ralph Gibson. Author Chris Ott suggests that the album title was probably a reference to Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Division/Unknown+Pleasures\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
