      "biography": "This Town Needs Guns (officially shortened to \"TTNG\" in 2013) are a math rock band originating from Oxford, United Kingdom. They were formed in 2004, and are currently signed to Sargent House (USA). Their debut full length album, Animals, was released in the UK via Big Scary Monsters Recording Company in October 2008 and shortly after in the US via Sargent House Records.\n\nThe original lineup consisted of Stuart Smith on rhythm guitar and vocals, Tim Collis on lead guitar, Simon Thompson on Drums and Ian Lewis on Bass. Ian and Simon left the band in 2005, to be replaced by Dan Adams (replaced by Jamie Cooper during the recording of Animals in 2008) on bass and Chris Collis (brother of guitarist Tim) on drums in early 2006. In earlier careers, bassist Jamie Cooper had worked as a graphic designer, drummer Chris Collis had been a librarian at the University of Oxford, guitarist Tim Collis was a primary school teacher, and lead vocalist Stuart Smith worked building websites for a publisher. On May 11, 2011, it was announced on This Town Needs Guns' website that lead singer Stuart Smith would be leaving the band to start a family, and that he would be replaced by Pennines' singer and guitarist, Henry Tremain. Bassist Jamie Cooper also left the band in late 2011 to focus on a full-time career in graphic design. Tremain has since taken over on bass guitar duties, converting the band into a power trio.\n\nThe band's second and third studio albums, 13.0.0.0.0 and Disappointment Island, were released in January 2013 and July 2016, both via Sargent House. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/This+Town+Needs+Guns\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
