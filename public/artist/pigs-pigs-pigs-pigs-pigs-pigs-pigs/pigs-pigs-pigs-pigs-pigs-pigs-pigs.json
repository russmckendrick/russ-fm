  "biography": "Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs, often shortened to Pigs x7, is a British rock band known for its intense, high-energy performances and unique blend of psych-rock, stoner metal, and noise rock. Formed in Newcastle in 2012, the band includes Matt Baty on vocals, Sam Grant on guitar, Adam Ian Sykes on guitar, John-Michael Hedley on bass, and Ewan Mackenzie on drums.\n\nPigs x7 quickly gained a reputation for their thrillingly relentless live shows that are as much of an endurance test as they are a psychedelic trip. The band's gritty, feedback-laden sound pays homage to the heaviest of rock and roll traditions while also pushing boundaries with their eclectic influences and sprawling compositions.\n\nThe band released their debut album, \"Feed The Rats\", in 2017 to critical acclaim. This was followed by \"King of Cowards\" in 2018 and \"Viscerals\" in 2020, each further cementing the band's unique place in the pantheon of heavy music. The success of their records and their incendiary live performances have seen Pigs x7 grow from a cult favorite to a force to be reckoned with on the global stage.",
