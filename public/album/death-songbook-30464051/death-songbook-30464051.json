He collaborated with Deborah Meadan of Dragon's Den to pull it off, who also lives in Somerset. \n\nThe first night of the festival, during which Gustav Holsts's The Planets suite was performed, was recently played on BBC Radio 2 in it's entirety. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charles+Hazlewood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
