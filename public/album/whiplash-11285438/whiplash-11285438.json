      "biography": "There are several artists in this entry:\n\n1) a British alternative rock band formed in 1981 in Manchester\n2) the vocalist of popular Bangladeshi band Nagar Baul\n3) a Dutch rapper connected to the Fakkelteitgroep. \n4) James, South Korean Musician\n\n1) James (formed 1981 in Manchester, England) are a popular band that were at the forefront of the indie rock movement, releasing a string of hit singles and maintaining popularity through the '90s. \n\nThe band's sound is mostly defined by their lead singer Tim Booth's resonating vocals and emotional lyrics, as well as a spirit of experimentation that they held onto throughout their active career. The band's most well-known songs include the hits \"Sit Down\" and \"Laid\", the former marking the band's rise to popularity. \n\nAlthough James predate the 'Madchester scene' of the late 1980s and their sound was never \"baggy\" nevertheless their Mancunian origins and their more commercial releases were appropriated by the scene. For many reasons, including the departure of lead singer Booth, the band's final album became a struggle to record. This departure occurred in 2001 and the band has been inactive since, though they never officially declared a breakup. In 2007, the band was reactivated when Booth returned to the band.\n\n2) James is the vocalist of popular Bangladeshi band Nagar Baul. He was a member of the band Feelings and later formed the band Nagar Baul. James was raised in Chittagong and later moved to Dhaka for his singing career. Stylishly longhaired James--overwhelmingly known as the Nagar Baul (the City Bard), was the pioneer of psychedelic rock in Bangladesh. Originally a lead singer and guitarist, he has always been respected for his solo projects. He became affectionately called Guru by his fans. His tunes were bright and his singing a divergence from the archetypal tunes preferred by the commercial-type directors. His songs expressed love, rage, discontent, frustration, and happiness.\n\n3) A Dutch rapper connected to the Fakkelteitgroep. \n\n4) James Lee - known as James - was a former member of Royal Pirates, a South Korean band. On 2015, he got into an accident that caused him unable to play bass any longer. Hence, he decided to left the band.\n\nJames moved back to Los Angeles and decided to release music written post accident in a project called ’the Light EP’ consisted of 5 tracks.

            "content": "Whiplash is the seventh studio album by English rock band James. It was released on 24 February 1997, through Fontana Records. Following the release of the band's experimental sixth studio album Wah Wah (1994), they began working on a follow-up in 1995 at drummer David Baynton-Power's home studio. Over the course of 1995 and 1996, James recorded at several studios – Westside, The Windings, Cafe Mullet, Real World, RAK, and Foel – with producers Stephen Hague, Brian Eno, and Baynton-Power. Described as electronic and folk rock release, the album mixed in elements of the band's previous two studio albums.\n\nPreceded by the release of Whiplash's lead single \"She's a Star\" in February 1997, James went on a United Kingdom tour the following month. The second single \"Tomorrow\" was released in April 1997; that same month, the band embarked on a tour of the United States. Shortly into the tour, frontman Tim Booth strained his neck, and later discovered that he had ruptured his C6 and C7 discs, causing the tour to be cancelled. The third single \"Waltzing Along\" was released in June 1997, coinciding with a stint on Lollapalooza until August of that year, when they appeared at the Reading Festival.\n\nWhiplash received generally positive reviews from music critics, some of whom noted James' attempt to mix their older sound with newer elements. It peaked at number 9 in the UK, while its singles all reached the UK top 30, the highest being \"She's a Star\" at number 9. Whiplash was later certified gold in the UK, and \"She's a Star\" was certified silver in the same territory. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/James/Whiplash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
