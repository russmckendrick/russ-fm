      "biography": "Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966 in Gary, IN) is an American singer, songwriter, producer, actress and dancer. She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of MTV, enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking gender and racial barriers in the process. Lyrical content which focused on social issues set her reputation as a role model for youth.\n\nThe tenth and youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times, Diff'rent Strokes, and Fame. After signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third and fourth studio albums Control (1986) and Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music.\n\nIn 1991, Jackson signed the first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry. Prior to her first studio project with Virgin, she appeared in her first of several lead film roles in Poetic Justice (1993). Her two studio albums which followed, Janet (1993) and The Velvet Rope (1997), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol. These records, along with their promotional music videos and live performances in concert tours, branded Jackson as one of the world's most erotic performers, garnering both criticism and praise. By the end of the 1990s, she was named by Billboard magazine as the second most successful recording artist of the decade after Mariah Carey. The release of her seventh studio album All for You in 2001 coincided with a celebration of her impact on the recording industry as the subject of the inaugural MTV Icon special.\n\nThe backlash from the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy resulted in an industry blacklisting under the direction of Les Moonves, then-CEO of CBS Corporation. Jackson subsequently experienced reduced radio airplay, televised promotion and sales figures from that point forward. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth studio album Discipline (2008), her first and only album with Island Records. In 2015, she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation and released her eleventh studio album Unbreakable the same year. Since then she has continued to release music as an independent artist.\n\nHaving sold over 100 million records, Jackson is one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has amassed an extensive catalog, with singles such as \"Nasty\", \"Rhythm Nation\", \"That's the Way Love Goes\", \"Together Again\", and \"All for You\"; she holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten entries on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with 18. She is also the only artist in the history of the chart to have seven commercial singles from one album (Rhythm Nation 1814) peak within the top five positions. In 2008, Billboard placed her number seven on its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, and in 2010 ranked her fifth among the \"Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\". In December 2016, the magazine named her the second most successful dance club artist after Madonna. One of the world's most awarded artists, her accolades include five Grammy Awards, eleven Billboard Music Awards, eleven American Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and eight Guinness World Records entries. In 2019, she was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Jackson has been cited as an inspiration among numerous performers and credited with elevating a standard of sound, showmanship and sex appeal expected of pop stars. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Janet+Jackson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

By the time of <i>Control</i>’s release in 1986, the budding superstar had released two albums—1982’s <i>Janet Jackson</i> and 1984’s <i>Dream Street</i>—and scored R&B hits like “Young Love” and “Don’t Stand Another Chance”. But the jury was still out on whether she was just capitalising on her appearances on such TV sitcoms as <i>Good Times</i> and <i>Diff’rent Strokes</i>—or, perhaps even more so, her nepo-sibling connection to the ascending King of Pop, Michael Jackson.\n\nBut all that changed when Jackson—after bossing up and firing her own father, Joe Jackson, as her manager—went to Minneapolis to work with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on what would be her true debut. The pairing of streetwise Prince protégés with sheltered music royalty was an odd coupling that worked against the odds, putting a nasty spin on Minneapolis funk that was all Miss Jackson; the result was one of the most successful and enduring artist-producer collaborations in pop history. At the time of <i>Control</i>’s release, pop’s heart was thumping to the likes of Madonna and Whitney Houston, and maintained by radio and MTV—but Jackson gave it a whole new beat.\n\nIndeed, when Jackson commanded “Gimme a beat!” at the beginning of “Nasty”—one of her countless hits—she was leading a new music movement for Black female empowerment, from Beyoncé and Rihanna to SZA and Doja Cat today. There is a militant assault in the fierce funk of her first single, “What Have You Done for Me Lately” (a tune that kicks off with what would become one of her trademark interludes). And the in-your-face title track foreshadows 1989’s <i>Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814</i>. But there is also a girlish giddiness to “When I Think of You”, Jackson’s first chart-topper, and a slow-jam sexiness to the album’s finale “Funny How Time Flies (When You’re Having Fun)”—both elements that would become defining pleasure principles for Jackson in the years ahead.",

            "content": "Control is the third studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986 by A&M Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of dance-pop, rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap vocals, and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators among pop and contemporary R&B. It enabled Jackson to transition into the popular music market, becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.\n\nContaining autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to the singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization.\n\nControl is widely regarded as the breakthrough album of Jackson's career. It became her first album to top the Billboard 200 and five of its commercial singles—\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\", \"Nasty\", \"Control\", \"When I Think of You\", and \"Let's Wait Awhile\"—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV's evolving demographics. The album went on to receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987. It is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time.
