      "biography": "Sonic Youth is an American alternative rock band from New York City, formed in 1981. Their most recent lineup consisted of Thurston Moore (guitar and vocals), Kim Gordon (bass guitar, vocals, and guitar), Lee Ranaldo (guitar and vocals), Steve Shelley (drums), and Mark Ibold (guitar and bass).\nIn their early career, Sonic Youth was associated with the no wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. As a result, some consider Sonic Youth as pivotal in the rise of the alternative rock and indie rock movements. The band experienced success and critical acclaim throughout their existence, continuing into the new millennium, including signing to major label DGC in 1990, and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival.\nSonic Youth expressed a wide variety of influences, ranging from the influential protopunk musician Patti Smith to composer John Cage. The band was praised for having \"redefined what rock guitar could do\", using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings, and preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. In 2011, Ranaldo announced that the band was \"ending for a while,\" following Moore and Gordon's separation.",

      "editorial_notes": "Sonic Youth’s move to a major label in 1990 was a pivotal moment in indie rock history: Not only did the band members anticipate the erasure between “mainstream” and “alternative” music that Nirvana would finalize a year later, they demonstrated that they could be conservative when it came to business, yet still radical in their music. With the move to DGC, Sonic Youth got a bigger budget for touring and marketing, and a reliable series of checks. Don’t let the childish album title fool you: <i>Goo</i> was proof that the four avant-garde noisemakers in Sonic Youth were growing up.\n\nThe major-label jump didn’t provoke an ethical dilemma for the band members—at least, not in the way it would for other artists in the 1990s, which saw an almost Red-Scare-style panic around the concept of “selling out”. As Thurston Moore put it in the oral history <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>: “At the time, there was no such thing as [being] <i>proud to be indie</i>. Being indie was just sort of, like—there was nothing else you could be. Major labels had no interest.”\n\nAs a result of their business smarts, the band members got paid—as did many of their friends—and the group held on to its creative freedom. In many ways, <i>Goo</i> was an extension of the same arc Sonic Youth had been on since 1986’s <i>Evol</i>: The riffs were bigger (“Dirty Boots”), the songs were more legible (the Chuck D-featuring “Kool Thing”) and the combination of mystery, intelligence and danger that had always made Kim Gordon magnetic got the spotlight it obviously deserved (“Tunic (Song For Karen)”).\n\nLater, Lee Ranaldo said that part of the reason the band went to a major label was because they’d meet fans in places like Montana and Wyoming who didn’t know where to buy their albums. With <i>Goo</i>, Sonic Youth would be on shelves next to Guns N’ Roses and Paula Abdul. The savvy was to realize that if you’re gonna confront rural teens with the idea of “[liberating] girls from male white corporate oppression” (“Kool Thing”), you probably have to adjust your approach accordingly. The interesting thing is that they almost did it. For the fans that the band had in mind—both real and imagined—<i>Goo</i> was evidence of a much bigger world outside.",

          "short": "With expert timing, and a killer batch of tunes, Sonic Youth joins the majors.",
          "standard": "Sonic Youth’s move to a major label in 1990 was a pivotal moment in indie rock history: Not only did the band members anticipate the erasure between “mainstream” and “alternative” music that Nirvana would finalize a year later, they demonstrated that they could be conservative when it came to business, yet still radical in their music. With the move to DGC, Sonic Youth got a bigger budget for touring and marketing, and a reliable series of checks. Don’t let the childish album title fool you: <i>Goo</i> was proof that the four avant-garde noisemakers in Sonic Youth were growing up.\n\nThe major-label jump didn’t provoke an ethical dilemma for the band members—at least, not in the way it would for other artists in the 1990s, which saw an almost Red-Scare-style panic around the concept of “selling out”. As Thurston Moore put it in the oral history <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>: “At the time, there was no such thing as [being] <i>proud to be indie</i>. Being indie was just sort of, like—there was nothing else you could be. Major labels had no interest.”\n\nAs a result of their business smarts, the band members got paid—as did many of their friends—and the group held on to its creative freedom. In many ways, <i>Goo</i> was an extension of the same arc Sonic Youth had been on since 1986’s <i>Evol</i>: The riffs were bigger (“Dirty Boots”), the songs were more legible (the Chuck D-featuring “Kool Thing”) and the combination of mystery, intelligence and danger that had always made Kim Gordon magnetic got the spotlight it obviously deserved (“Tunic (Song For Karen)”).\n\nLater, Lee Ranaldo said that part of the reason the band went to a major label was because they’d meet fans in places like Montana and Wyoming who didn’t know where to buy their albums. With <i>Goo</i>, Sonic Youth would be on shelves next to Guns N’ Roses and Paula Abdul. The savvy was to realize that if you’re gonna confront rural teens with the idea of “[liberating] girls from male white corporate oppression” (“Kool Thing”), you probably have to adjust your approach accordingly. The interesting thing is that they almost did it. For the fans that the band had in mind—both real and imagined—<i>Goo</i> was evidence of a much bigger world outside."

            "content": "Goo is the sixth full-length studio album by American alternative rock band Sonic Youth, released on June 26, 1990 by DGC Records. For this album, the band sought to expand upon its trademark alternating guitar arrangements and the layered sound of their previous album Daydream Nation (1988) with songwriting on that was more topical than past works, exploring themes of female empowerment and pop culture. Coming off the success of Daydream Nation, Nick Sansano returned to engineer Goo, but veteran producer Ron Saint Germain was chosen by Sonic Youth to finish mixing the album following Sansano's dismissal.\n\nGoo was a critical and commercial success upon its release, peaking at number 96 on the US Billboard 200, their highest chart position to date. Although it lacked significant radio airplay, its lead single \"Kool Thing\", a collaborative effort with Public Enemy's Chuck D, reached number seven on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Since then, Goo has been viewed as one of alternative rock's most important albums, and is considered musically and artistically significant. In 2020, the album was ranked at number 358 on Rolling Stone's 500 greatest albums of all time list.\n\nIn 1989, nearly a year after the release of the band's breakthrough album Daydream Nation, Sonic Youth announced that it had signed a recording contract with Geffen Records, the group's first major label deal. Sonic Youth decided to sever relations with its former label, Enigma Records, as a result of the band's displeasure with Enigma's indecisive marketing and distribution of Daydream Nation, as well as \"Teen Age Riot\"—‌the album's accompanying single. Another factor that contributed to the group's departure from the label was Enigma's handling of The Whitey Album, an experimental album of sound manipulation and hip-hop influences released under the name Ciccone Youth. Not only did Enigma reject the band's proposal to simultaneously release the album with Daydream Nation, the label's publicity branch also attempted to withdraw its cover art—an enlarged photo of Madonna's face—even though Madonna reportedly gave Sonic Youth her permission to use it.\n\nBy mid-1989, Sonic Youth's relationship with its British and American label head Paul Smith, who the band's legal counsel, Richard Grebal, termed \"a trusted advisor but never a manager\", was growing increasingly strained. Tensions between Smith and the group had begun in 1986 when Smith arranged the release of live recordings by the band on the album Walls Have Ears without their input. Mindful about their work and image, Sonic Youth was irritated by the decision, especially when the album was distributed before Evol. The situation was compounded further when Smith took a bold negotiating stance with major record labels during the Daydream Nation tour and took long intervals to communicate information to the band. His stance, which had the potential to scare away record executives, represented the final straw for the band. On June 2, 1989, Sonic Youth went to Smith's apartment, ostensibly to discuss another music video for Daydream Nation, to announce an end to their partnership.\n\nHaving entertained offers from A&M Records, Atlantic Records, and Mute Records, Sonic Youth signed a five-album deal worth $300,000 with a clause which secured the band's complete control of its creative output. The group, however, was somewhat dissatisfied that the album would not be released by Geffen but rather a new and unestablished subsidiary label, DGC Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Youth/Goo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
