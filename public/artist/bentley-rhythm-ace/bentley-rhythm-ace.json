  "biography": "Bentley Rhythm Ace (BRA) is a band formed in Birmingham, England in the late 1990s, by former members of the band Pop Will Eat Itself, with guest appearances by Milf, a member of indie band EMF.\n\nTheir self-titled debut ('Bentley Rhythm Ace') was released in 1997 and spawned the hugely popular single 'Bentley's Gonna Sort You Out'. A second album, 'For Your Ears Only', was released in 2000 but was less popular. A further single 'Madam, Your Carriage Awaits' was released. The group also compiled a 2CD 'FSUK' compilation (FSUK 3 (Mixed by Bentley Rhythm Ace) (disc 1); FSUK 3 (Mixed by Bentley Rhythm Ace) (disc 2)).\n\nThe name likely refers to the Rhythm Ace line of analogue drum machines manufactured by Ace Tone, some of which were rebranded and distributed by Bentley Pianos in the UK.\n\nThe group epitomises the Big Beat era. Signed to Skint Records, they have enjoyed much commercial success with their music being used on television advertisements and with an enormous underground following.\n\nThe group have all but split, playing the occasional low-key DJ set and have released no further material since 2000. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bentley+Rhythm+Ace\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
