  "biography": "Roxy Music is an English rock band formed in 1970 by Bryan Ferry—who became the band's lead vocalist and principal songwriter—and bassist Graham Simpson. The other longtime members are Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe), and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion). Other members included Brian Eno (synthesizer and \"treatments\") and Eddie Jobson (synthesizer and violin). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and have toured together intermittently since. Ferry frequently enlisted band members as session musicians for his solo releases.\n\nRoxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s. This success began with their self-titled debut studio album in 1972. The band pioneered more musically sophisticated elements of glam rock while significantly influencing early English punk music, and provided a model for many new wave acts while innovating elements of electronic composition. The group also conveyed their distinctive brand of visual and musical sophistication with their focus on glamorous fashions. Ferry and co-founding member Eno have had influential solo careers. Eno became one of the most significant British record producers of the late 20th century. Rolling Stone originally ranked Roxy Music No. 98 on their greatest artists list (\"The Immortals – The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"), but dropped the group from the list when they updated it in 2011.\n\nRoxy Music's final studio album was Avalon (1982), which was certified Platinum in the United States. In 2005, the band began recording what would have become their ninth studio album—and their first album with Eno since 1973 (he wrote two songs for it and also played keyboards). However, Ferry eventually announced that the material from these sessions would instead be released as a Ferry solo studio album, with Eno playing on \"a couple of tracks\", and that he believed the group would never again produce a record as Roxy Music. The album was released in 2010 as the Ferry solo studio album Olympia. It featured contributions from Eno, Manzanera, and Mackay (amongst many other session players).\n\nIn 2011, Roxy Music played a series of 40th-anniversary shows, but went inactive as a performing entity following the concerts. In 2019, Roxy Music were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2022, Roxy Music reformed for a tour to mark the 50th anniversary of their debut studio album.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_Music\n\nStudio albums\nRoxy Music (1972)\nFor Your Pleasure (1973)\nStranded (1973)\nCountry Life (1974)\nSiren (1975)\nManifesto (1979)\nFlesh and Blood (1980)\nAvalon (1982) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Roxy+Music\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
