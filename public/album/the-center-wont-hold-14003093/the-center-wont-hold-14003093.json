      "biography": "Sleater-Kinney was formed in early 1994 in Olympia, Washington, by Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein. Tucker was formerly in the influential riot grrrl band Heavens to Betsy, while Brownstein was formerly in the queercore band Excuse 17. They often played at gigs together and formed Sleater-Kinney as a side-project from their respective bands. When Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17 disbanded, Sleater-Kinney became their primary focus. Janet Weiss of Quasi is the band's longest lasting and final drummer, though Sleater-Kinney has had other drummers, including Lora Macfarlane, Misty Farrell, and Toni Gogin.\nUpon Tucker's graduation from Evergreen State College (where Brownstein remained a student for three more years), she and then-girlfriend Brownstein took a trip to Australia in early 1994. Their last day there, they stayed up all night recording what would become their self-titled debut album. It was released the following spring. They followed this with Call the Doctor (1996) and Dig Me Out (1997), and became critical darlings as a result.\nTheir next few albums pushed the band towards mainstream listeners, culminating in 2002's One Beat. The group opened for Pearl Jam at many North American shows beginning in 2003, and the band cited the experience of playing to large arenas as part of the inspiration and motivation for the music found on their last album, The Woods. The Woods was released in 2005, and was a departure from the sound of their previous albums. In its place, The Woods featured a denser, heavily distorted sound that drew on classic rock as its inspiration. In 2006 they helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow's Parties festival.\nRenowned critics Greil Marcus and Robert Christgau have each praised Sleater-Kinney as one of the essential rock groups of the late 90s/early 00s. Marcus named Sleater-Kinney America's best rock band in a 2001 issue of Time magazine.",

      "editorial_notes": "Sleater-Kinney’s ninth album in 25 years—and their second since reforming in 2014 after a decade-long break—marks a new era of experimentation for the Portland rock band. “We’re truly in the middle period of Sleater-Kinney,” Carrie Brownstein tells Apple Music. “You're taking what you know and then figuring out the future. What can we rely upon? How can we change it?” <i>The Center Won’t Hold</i> was produced by Annie Clark (aka St. Vincent), and her boundary-pushing influence can be heard throughout. “We knew she was a fan of the band, and she's a friend of ours,” says Brownstein. “We knew she would bring something innovative and imaginative to it.” The record features long-time members Brownstein, Corin Tucker and drummer Janet Weiss, who left suddenly before its release. “We really allowed ourselves to feel what we needed to feel and express what we needed to express,” says Tucker. “There's a lot of anger, but there's also some grief.” Here, Brownstein and Tucker talk through each song on <i>The Center Won’t Hold</i>.<br />\n<b>“The Center Won't Hold”</b> \nCorin Tucker: “We really wanted to immediately set the stage with a catastrophic theme for the beginning of the album. An element of grief, almost like a funeral procession.” \nCarrie Brownstein: “It’s setting up the idea that this was going to be something unexpected. We’re taking the listener somewhere a little disorienting at first, to introduce the idea of something being a little of this or not quite right.”<br />\n<b>“Hurry On Home”</b> \nBrownstein: “We wanted it to be dancey, but a guitar song as well. Even though it's more political-sounding, you're still in the very industrial world that we've taken you to. But I think that we add those metallic and industrial sounds even throughout a more pop song.” \nTucker: “It's about modes of betrayal. Feeling lured in by the promise of something, only to have it be revealed as inadequate. Whether that's a person or a country or a politician, it's about feeling betrayed again by these institutions and infrastructures.”<br />\n<b>“Reach Out”</b>\nTucker: “Here, the narrator finds themselves in a really unexpected place. It’s like those feelings of despair have washed over them many times and they've been able to come back a little bit. There are themes of vulnerability and isolation, but this song is like a really direct plea for connection.”<br />\n<b>“Can I Go On”</b> \nBrownstein: “We played with paradoxes and contradictions on this record, and the songs that deal with despondency are countered by catchiness and melodiousness. You have someone who's grappling with uncertainty and depression and self-annihilation. But then the choruses come together with group vocals. We purposely wanted to have the verses sung with a kind of loneliness, but then it comes together in the chorus as a metaphor for finding connection and allies.”<br />\n<b>“Restless”</b> \nTucker: “There is so much that is grotesque and ugly in ourselves and the world around us. Then trying to figure out what to do with it—that we're not just always given what's easier, what's beautiful in ourselves, in our relationships, in our friendships. People are complex, and this song wrestles with a lot of those complexities and it seeks acceptance. I think it seeks compassion.”<br />\n<b>“RUINS”</b> \nTucker: “This goes to full tragedy stage, but the narrator is just embraced in the situation and there's almost a bit of celebration with it because it is just so dark and it's so all-encompassing. It was really fun to record it with Annie and Carrie and Janet; I feel like we just exploded our sound as a band in a really exciting way.”<br />\n<b>“LOVE”</b> \nTucker: “‘RUINS’ really takes you into this void and relishes its place in that blackness. This is a break from that intensity. We were thinking a lot about resistance on this record, how much a body can withstand trespass and trauma. One of the fulcrums for resistance is collaboration and friendship, and ‘LOVE’ tells a story of one form of collaboration. Hopefully the song is a rallying cry, as a way of celebrating solidarity and togetherness as a way to keep pushing forward.”<br />\n<b>“Bad Dance”</b> \nTucker: “I think it takes the idea of complicity to its fullest point. The narrator is fully immersed and just enjoying what they can get out of the experience of corruption and cravenness. It's like a deranged creature.”<br />\n<b>“The Future Is Here”</b> \nTucker: “If ‘Bad Dance’ is like a terrible party, this is the next morning. just realising where we're at and reflecting on what that means and feeling sad about it and just connecting with those emotions, I think.”<br />\n<b>“The Dog/The Body”</b> \nBrownstein: “I wrote this song after Tom Petty died, and I think it feels very Tom Petty in the chorus. There's these weird things when people leave you and leave this world. I remember listening to Tom Petty's music, but he’s not here. And that was a weird haunted feeling to me. With the chorus, Annie was like, ‘I just want this to sound like everyone's at a bar singing along at the end of the night, like when the lights come on.’”<br />\n<b>“Broken”</b> \nTucker: “This song is really about realising that there's some social justice that hasn't happened in our country, and I probably won't see it in my lifetime. That's a sad feeling. There's mourning and grief there about the world we're living in.” Brownstein: “I think you have to find new ways of loving something and appreciating it. And it's good to kind of step outside of that comfort zone a bit. We’ve written on guitar for so long. But I'm such a fan of Corin's voice, and to hear her sing over a piano song for me is very rewarding.”",
