  "biography": "William John Paul \"Liam\" Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He rose to fame as the lead singer of the rock band Oasis, and later as the singer of Beady Eye, before performing as a solo artist after the dissolution of both previous bands. His erratic behaviour, distinctive singing style, and abrasive attitude have been the subject of commentary in the press; he remains one of the most recognisable figures in modern British music.\n\nAlthough his older brother Noel wrote the majority of Oasis' songs, Liam penned the singles \"Songbird\" and \"I'm Outta Time\", along with a string of album tracks and B-sides. Noel departed Oasis in 2009 and formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, while Liam continued with the other former members of Oasis under the Beady Eye name until they disbanded in 2014. His debut solo album As You Were was released 6 October 2017.\n\nGallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 reader poll by Q magazine.\n\nWilliam John Paul Gallagher was born in Burnage, Manchester, to Irish parents Thomas and Peggy Gallagher. Liam was abused by his father as a child, and although his older brothers Noel and Paul took the most abuse, Liam has said that the abuse affected him deeply and inspired him to become an artist. When Liam was 10, Peggy took the boys and moved away from Thomas (she divorced him in 1986). Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, he has said that their issues remain unresolved.\n\nPaul and Noel often contend that even from a young age, Liam went out of his way to antagonise people, especially Noel, with whom he shared a bedroom. The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens. Liam often stole bicycles from local shops. He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury; despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in Spring 1990. He gained 4 GCSEs.\n\nNoel has said that Liam showed little interest in music until his late teens, also that Liam was better looking than him, a better singer, had better clothes and could pull off a parka jacket better. Gallagher became confident in his ability to sing and began listening to bands like the Beatles, the Stone Roses, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, and T.Rex. In the process he forged a lifelong obsession with former Beatles singer/songwriter John Lennon; Liam would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon re-incarnated, despite being born eight years prior to Lennon's death.\n\nOn 26 July 2015 Gallagher appeared at an Irish pub in Charlestown, County Mayo playing a number of songs, including an early version of his new song 'Bold', in front of pub guests with an acoustic guitar. However, on 4 January 2016, he said on Twitter that he has no plans to pursue a solo career, writing, \"Solo record are you fucking tripping dickhead im not a cunt LG X.\" However, in a 2016 interview with Q Magazine, he officially announced he would be releasing songs in 2017 although he doesn't consider it a solo career, advising they're just songs that he has written over the years that he'd like to release. Gallagher made reference to the previously mentioned tweet, by stating \"It's official I'm a cunt LG x\" via Twitter.\n\nA solo appearance at Norwegian festival Bergenfest in 2017 was announced in November 2016, with other festival appearances for summer 2017 later confirmed. It was announced in March 2017 that the debut solo album was to be titled As You Were. On 26 May 2017, he announced the release of his solo debut single \"Wall of Glass\" on 1 June 2017, however it was released a day earlier on 31 May with an accompanying music video. In the same month, Gallagher performed his first solo concert at the Ritz in Manchester with all proceeds going to victims of the Manchester terror attack.\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Gallagher made a surprise appearance at the One Love Manchester benefit concert where he played \"Rock 'N' Roll Star\", \"Wall of Glass\" and \"Live Forever\" with Coldplay's Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland. Gallagher performed at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany in June 2017. In the same month he performed at the Pinkpop festival in the Netherlands. After a management dispute in early 2017, Gallagher has been represented by his nephew, Australian born Daniel Nicholas.\n\nGallagher performed at Glastonbury in June 2017. During the set he sang \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" for the first time, dedicating his performance to the victims of the recent Manchester and London terror attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire. On 30 June 2017, he released his second solo single \"Chinatown\". In July 2017, he performed at the Exit festival in Serbia and Benicassim festival in Spain.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Gallagher performed at Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and left the stage in the middle of a song after performing for only 20 minutes. He later apologized on Twitter and claimed he had vocal problems. On 10 August 2017 \"For What It's Worth\" was released, a song Gallagher described as an \"apology\" saying \"...I've made a lot of mistakes...I guess it is an apology to whoever. I've pissed a lot of people off\". He performed this song on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on 14 August 2017.",

He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band  Oasis, which he co-founded in 1991. He later fronted the band Beady Eye from 2010 to 2014 before launching a solo career in 2017. Gallagher is regarded as one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music and is known for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken manner.\\n\\nGallagher joined a band initially known as the Rain. Following mutual agreement among its members, the band was renamed Oasis. His older brother, Noel Gallagher, was first approached to manage the group but later joined as lead guitarist. Oasis released their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe\", in 1994 to critical and commercial success amid the rise of Britpop. Their second album, \"(What\\'s the Story) Morning Glory?\", released in 1995, achieved international chart success, while their third album, \"Be Here Now\" (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Although Britpop declined in popularity towards the end of the 1990s, Oasis continued to release commercially successful albums, all of which topped the UK Albums Chart. The band performed to large audiences worldwide, particularly in Europe and South America. In August 2009, following Noel Gallagher’s departure from Oasis, Liam Gallagher and the remaining members formed Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums before disbanding in 2014.\\n\\nGallagher began his solo career in 2017 with the release of his debut album \"As You Were\", which was both a critical and commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. The album was later certified platinum in the UK. His second solo album, \"Why Me? Why Not\", released in 2019, also reached number one and became the fastest-selling vinyl record of that year. This marked Gallagher’s tenth number one album, including his work with Oasis. His third solo album, \"C’mon You Know\", released in 2022, also debuted at number one in the UK. In 2024, Gallagher collaborated with former Stone Roses guitarist John Squire on the studio album \"Liam Gallagher & John Squire\", released on 1 March 2024.\\n\\nGallagher\\'s career with Oasis was marked by public disputes with his brother Noel and frequent media coverage of their personal behaviour. The band’s rivalry with fellow Britpop group Blur also received significant attention during the 1990s. In 2010, Gallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a Q magazine reader poll. In 2019, he was awarded the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon.\\n\\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Gallagher\\n\\nStudio albums\\nAs You Were (2017)\\nWhy Me? Why Not.

He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band  Oasis, which he co-founded in 1991. He later fronted the band Beady Eye from 2010 to 2014 before launching a solo career in 2017. Gallagher is regarded as one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music and is known for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken manner.\\n\\nGallagher joined a band initially known as the Rain. Following mutual agreement among its members, the band was renamed Oasis. His older brother, Noel Gallagher, was first approached to manage the group but later joined as lead guitarist. Oasis released their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe\", in 1994 to critical and commercial success amid the rise of Britpop. Their second album, \"(What\\'s the Story) Morning Glory?\", released in 1995, achieved international chart success, while their third album, \"Be Here Now\" (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Although Britpop declined in popularity towards the end of the 1990s, Oasis continued to release commercially successful albums, all of which topped the UK Albums Chart. The band performed to large audiences worldwide, particularly in Europe and South America. In August 2009, following Noel Gallagher’s departure from Oasis, Liam Gallagher and the remaining members formed Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums before disbanding in 2014.\\n\\nGallagher began his solo career in 2017 with the release of his debut album \"As You Were\", which was both a critical and commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. The album was later certified platinum in the UK. His second solo album, \"Why Me? Why Not\", released in 2019, also reached number one and became the fastest-selling vinyl record of that year. This marked Gallagher’s tenth number one album, including his work with Oasis. His third solo album, \"C’mon You Know\", released in 2022, also debuted at number one in the UK. In 2024, Gallagher collaborated with former Stone Roses guitarist John Squire on the studio album \"Liam Gallagher & John Squire\", released on 1 March 2024.\\n\\nGallagher\\'s career with Oasis was marked by public disputes with his brother Noel and frequent media coverage of their personal behaviour. The band’s rivalry with fellow Britpop group Blur also received significant attention during the 1990s. In 2010, Gallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a Q magazine reader poll. In 2019, he was awarded the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon.\\n\\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Gallagher\\n\\nStudio albums\\nAs You Were (2017)\\nWhy Me? Why Not.

      "biography_en": "William John Paul \"Liam\" Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He rose to fame as the lead singer of the rock band Oasis, and later as the singer of Beady Eye, before performing as a solo artist after the dissolution of both previous bands. His erratic behaviour, distinctive singing style, and abrasive attitude have been the subject of commentary in the press; he remains one of the most recognisable figures in modern British music.\n\nAlthough his older brother Noel wrote the majority of Oasis' songs, Liam penned the singles \"Songbird\" and \"I'm Outta Time\", along with a string of album tracks and B-sides. Noel departed Oasis in 2009 and formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, while Liam continued with the other former members of Oasis under the Beady Eye name until they disbanded in 2014. His debut solo album As You Were was released 6 October 2017.\n\nGallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 reader poll by Q magazine.\n\nWilliam John Paul Gallagher was born in Burnage, Manchester, to Irish parents Thomas and Peggy Gallagher. Liam was abused by his father as a child, and although his older brothers Noel and Paul took the most abuse, Liam has said that the abuse affected him deeply and inspired him to become an artist. When Liam was 10, Peggy took the boys and moved away from Thomas (she divorced him in 1986). Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, he has said that their issues remain unresolved.\n\nPaul and Noel often contend that even from a young age, Liam went out of his way to antagonise people, especially Noel, with whom he shared a bedroom. The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens. Liam often stole bicycles from local shops. He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury; despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in Spring 1990. He gained 4 GCSEs.\n\nNoel has said that Liam showed little interest in music until his late teens, also that Liam was better looking than him, a better singer, had better clothes and could pull off a parka jacket better. Gallagher became confident in his ability to sing and began listening to bands like the Beatles, the Stone Roses, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, and T.Rex. In the process he forged a lifelong obsession with former Beatles singer/songwriter John Lennon; Liam would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon re-incarnated, despite being born eight years prior to Lennon's death.\n\nOn 26 July 2015 Gallagher appeared at an Irish pub in Charlestown, County Mayo playing a number of songs, including an early version of his new song 'Bold', in front of pub guests with an acoustic guitar. However, on 4 January 2016, he said on Twitter that he has no plans to pursue a solo career, writing, \"Solo record are you fucking tripping dickhead im not a cunt LG X.\" However, in a 2016 interview with Q Magazine, he officially announced he would be releasing songs in 2017 although he doesn't consider it a solo career, advising they're just songs that he has written over the years that he'd like to release. Gallagher made reference to the previously mentioned tweet, by stating \"It's official I'm a cunt LG x\" via Twitter.\n\nA solo appearance at Norwegian festival Bergenfest in 2017 was announced in November 2016, with other festival appearances for summer 2017 later confirmed. It was announced in March 2017 that the debut solo album was to be titled As You Were. On 26 May 2017, he announced the release of his solo debut single \"Wall of Glass\" on 1 June 2017, however it was released a day earlier on 31 May with an accompanying music video. In the same month, Gallagher performed his first solo concert at the Ritz in Manchester with all proceeds going to victims of the Manchester terror attack.\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Gallagher made a surprise appearance at the One Love Manchester benefit concert where he played \"Rock 'N' Roll Star\", \"Wall of Glass\" and \"Live Forever\" with Coldplay's Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland. Gallagher performed at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany in June 2017. In the same month he performed at the Pinkpop festival in the Netherlands. After a management dispute in early 2017, Gallagher has been represented by his nephew, Australian born Daniel Nicholas.\n\nGallagher performed at Glastonbury in June 2017. During the set he sang \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" for the first time, dedicating his performance to the victims of the recent Manchester and London terror attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire. On 30 June 2017, he released his second solo single \"Chinatown\". In July 2017, he performed at the Exit festival in Serbia and Benicassim festival in Spain.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Gallagher performed at Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and left the stage in the middle of a song after performing for only 20 minutes. He later apologized on Twitter and claimed he had vocal problems. On 10 August 2017 \"For What It's Worth\" was released, a song Gallagher described as an \"apology\" saying \"...I've made a lot of mistakes...I guess it is an apology to whoever. I've pissed a lot of people off\". He performed this song on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on 14 August 2017.",

      "bio_content": "William John Paul Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band  Oasis, which he co-founded in 1991. He later fronted the band Beady Eye from 2010 to 2014 before launching a solo career in 2017. Gallagher is regarded as one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music and is known for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken manner.\n\nGallagher joined a band initially known as the Rain. Following mutual agreement among its members, the band was renamed Oasis. His older brother, Noel Gallagher, was first approached to manage the group but later joined as lead guitarist. Oasis released their debut album, \"Definitely Maybe\", in 1994 to critical and commercial success amid the rise of Britpop. Their second album, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", released in 1995, achieved international chart success, while their third album, \"Be Here Now\" (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Although Britpop declined in popularity towards the end of the 1990s, Oasis continued to release commercially successful albums, all of which topped the UK Albums Chart. The band performed to large audiences worldwide, particularly in Europe and South America. In August 2009, following Noel Gallagher’s departure from Oasis, Liam Gallagher and the remaining members formed Beady Eye, releasing two studio albums before disbanding in 2014.\n\nGallagher began his solo career in 2017 with the release of his debut album \"As You Were\", which was both a critical and commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. The album was later certified platinum in the UK. His second solo album, \"Why Me? Why Not\", released in 2019, also reached number one and became the fastest-selling vinyl record of that year. This marked Gallagher’s tenth number one album, including his work with Oasis. His third solo album, \"C’mon You Know\", released in 2022, also debuted at number one in the UK. In 2024, Gallagher collaborated with former Stone Roses guitarist John Squire on the studio album \"Liam Gallagher & John Squire\", released on 1 March 2024.\n\nGallagher's career with Oasis was marked by public disputes with his brother Noel and frequent media coverage of their personal behaviour. The band’s rivalry with fellow Britpop group Blur also received significant attention during the 1990s. In 2010, Gallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a Q magazine reader poll. In 2019, he was awarded the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Gallagher\n\nStudio albums\nAs You Were (2017)\nWhy Me? Why Not.

He rose to fame as the lead singer of the rock band Oasis, and later as the singer of Beady Eye, before performing as a solo artist after the dissolution of both previous bands. His erratic behaviour, distinctive singing style, and abrasive attitude have been the subject of commentary in the press; he remains one of the most recognisable figures in modern British music.\n\nAlthough his older brother Noel wrote the majority of Oasis' songs, Liam penned the singles \"Songbird\" and \"I'm Outta Time\", along with a string of album tracks and B-sides. Noel departed Oasis in 2009 and formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, while Liam continued with the other former members of Oasis under the Beady Eye name until they disbanded in 2014. His debut solo album As You Were was released 6 October 2017.\n\nGallagher was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 reader poll by Q magazine.\n\nWilliam John Paul Gallagher was born in Burnage, Manchester, to Irish parents Thomas and Peggy Gallagher. Liam was abused by his father as a child, and although his older brothers Noel and Paul took the most abuse, Liam has said that the abuse affected him deeply and inspired him to become an artist. When Liam was 10, Peggy took the boys and moved away from Thomas (she divorced him in 1986). Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, he has said that their issues remain unresolved.\n\nPaul and Noel often contend that even from a young age, Liam went out of his way to antagonise people, especially Noel, with whom he shared a bedroom. The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens. Liam often stole bicycles from local shops. He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury; despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in Spring 1990. He gained 4 GCSEs.\n\nNoel has said that Liam showed little interest in music until his late teens, also that Liam was better looking than him, a better singer, had better clothes and could pull off a parka jacket better. Gallagher became confident in his ability to sing and began listening to bands like the Beatles, the Stone Roses, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, and T.Rex. In the process he forged a lifelong obsession with former Beatles singer/songwriter John Lennon; Liam would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon re-incarnated, despite being born eight years prior to Lennon's death.\n\nOn 26 July 2015 Gallagher appeared at an Irish pub in Charlestown, County Mayo playing a number of songs, including an early version of his new song 'Bold', in front of pub guests with an acoustic guitar. However, on 4 January 2016, he said on Twitter that he has no plans to pursue a solo career, writing, \"Solo record are you fucking tripping dickhead im not a cunt LG X.\" However, in a 2016 interview with Q Magazine, he officially announced he would be releasing songs in 2017 although he doesn't consider it a solo career, advising they're just songs that he has written over the years that he'd like to release. Gallagher made reference to the previously mentioned tweet, by stating \"It's official I'm a cunt LG x\" via Twitter.\n\nA solo appearance at Norwegian festival Bergenfest in 2017 was announced in November 2016, with other festival appearances for summer 2017 later confirmed. It was announced in March 2017 that the debut solo album was to be titled As You Were. On 26 May 2017, he announced the release of his solo debut single \"Wall of Glass\" on 1 June 2017, however it was released a day earlier on 31 May with an accompanying music video. In the same month, Gallagher performed his first solo concert at the Ritz in Manchester with all proceeds going to victims of the Manchester terror attack.\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Gallagher made a surprise appearance at the One Love Manchester benefit concert where he played \"Rock 'N' Roll Star\", \"Wall of Glass\" and \"Live Forever\" with Coldplay's Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland. Gallagher performed at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany in June 2017. In the same month he performed at the Pinkpop festival in the Netherlands. After a management dispute in early 2017, Gallagher has been represented by his nephew, Australian born Daniel Nicholas.\n\nGallagher performed at Glastonbury in June 2017. During the set he sang \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" for the first time, dedicating his performance to the victims of the recent Manchester and London terror attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire. On 30 June 2017, he released his second solo single \"Chinatown\". In July 2017, he performed at the Exit festival in Serbia and Benicassim festival in Spain.\n\nOn 3 August 2017, Gallagher performed at Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and left the stage in the middle of a song after performing for only 20 minutes. He later apologized on Twitter and claimed he had vocal problems. On 10 August 2017 \"For What It's Worth\" was released, a song Gallagher described as an \"apology\" saying \"...I've made a lot of mistakes...I guess it is an apology to whoever. I've pissed a lot of people off\". He performed this song on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on 14 August 2017.",
