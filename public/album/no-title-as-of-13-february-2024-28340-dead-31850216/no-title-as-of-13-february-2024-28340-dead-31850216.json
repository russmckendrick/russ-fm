      "biography": "Godspeed You! Black Emperor (formerly punctuated Godspeed You Black Emperor!; abbreviated to GYBE) is a Canadian post-rock band formed in 1994 and based in Montreal, Quebec. One of the first musical acts to publish their albums through the Constellation Records label, they have since released three studio albums and one EP.\n\nThe nine-piece group is well-known for working on a near-orchestral scale, utilizing such techniques as wide dynamic ranges and prepared guitars with altered timbre—typically achieved using a screwdriver (a technique originally used by Sonic Youth)—to reach their often brooding sound. They are also known for their lengthy songs, which are composed in a classical manner with multiple movements.\n\nThe band took its name from God Speed You! Black Emperor, a 1976 Japanese black-and-white documentary by director Mitsuo Yanagimachi, which follows the exploits of a Japanese biker gang, the Black Emperors. The band is most commonly classified as post-rock, but they exhibit influences from a range of styles including progressive rock, punk, classical music and avant-garde. Each record consists of a few fairly long tracks (mostly between 15 and 25 minutes, but some as long as 29 minutes and some as short as 6), divided into \"movements\" which are sometimes specified in the record sleeve.\n\nThe band formed around 1994 with three members, but its lineup has changed frequently. The band has had as many as twenty members at one time, but has tended to settle down to a group of nine. The instruments played vary with the lineup, but the music tends to be based around electric and bass guitars, strings and a percussion section. Other instruments such as the Glockenspiel and the French horn make more occasional appearances. The music on some of their records is accompanied by spoken samples recorded by the band across North America, including an apocalyptic street preacher from Providence, Rhode Island, an announcement at a gas station, a group of children talking and singing in French, as well as many recordings taken off shortwave radio.\n\nThe band members have in the past been reluctant to give interviews, and have expressed their distaste for the mainstream, corporation-owned music industry. This has given them a reputation as shadowy, even unfriendly figures, and not a great deal is known about them personally. They did, however, become considerably more widely known after appearing on the cover of British music magazine the NME in 1999.\n\nThe member who interacts with the press the most is Efrim Menuck, and for this reason he is sometimes presented as a front-man. However, he has strongly repudiated this label. In an interview conducted by Insound, Efrim and former band member Roger-Tellier Craig have a strong showing of their political views on corporate media.\n\nAlthough various members of the band are often pinned down as anarchists, no one in the band has explicitly subscribed to this label[5]; however, there is a strong political component to the band's music.[6] For example, the liner notes to Yanqui U.X.O. describe the song \"09-15-00\" as \"Ariel Sharon surrounded by 1,000 Israeli soldiers marching on al-Haram Ash-Sharif & provoking another Intifada,\" and the back cover of that album depicts the relationships of several major record labels to the military-industrial complex (image can be found at Constellation Records). Several of their songs also incorporate voice samples which express political sentiments, most notably \"The Dead Flag Blues\" (on F♯A♯∞) and \"BBF3\" (on Slow Riot for New Zerø Kanada).\n\nMembers of the group have formed a number of side projects, including Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band, Fly Pan Am, Hrsta, and Set Fire to Flames.\n\nThe band released the CD versions of its first two albums on the Kranky record label, and released the LPs through Constellation Records. The LP and the CD of Yanqui U.X.O. were produced by Constellation after their contract with Kranky ran out.\n\nIn 2004, long-time guitarist Roger-Tellier Craig left the band on amicable terms to devote more time to Fly Pan Am.\n\nGodspeed You! Black Emperor announced an indefinite hiatus in mid-2003.   A misquoted interview in February 2008 reported the band had broken up, but this was later confirmed as false.  In 2010 the band reconvened for a series of tours, and in October 2012 they released a new album: 'Allelujah!  Don't Bend!  Ascend!  Most of this album is made up of previously unreleased material from before the hiatus.  However according to band member Bruce Cawdon the group is also working on new material.\n\nThe group was once misconstrued as being a band of terrorists.[7][8] After stopping at a local gas station for fuel in the town of Ardmore, Oklahoma, during their 2003 tour of the United States, the station attendant working that day believed the group of Canadians to be terrorists. She quickly passed a note to another customer also getting fuel to call the police. When the local police appeared, the group was held until they could be questioned by the FBI. Although the police were suspicious of the band's anti-government documents and some stranger photos they had (such as those of oil rigs), they found no incriminating evidence. After background checks were run, the ensemble was released from custody and continued on their way to their next show in St. Louis, Missouri. Efrim Menuck later spoke to the crowd about what happened to them during their appearance in Missouri and speculated that their race was a motive for being released quickly (\"It's a good thing we're nice white kids from Canada\"), hinting at racism in the police force.[9] The incident was mentioned in Michael Moore's book, Dude, Where's My Country? <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Godspeed+You+Black+Emperor%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
