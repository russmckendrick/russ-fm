      "biography": "Purple Mountains was the creation of American musician, singer, poet and cartoonist David Cloud Berman (born David Craig Berman on 4 January 1967; died August 7, 2019). \n\nIn 2019, 10 years since retiring Silver Jews and retreating from public life, Berman returned as Purple Mountains with the eponymous album released on 12 July 2019 on the Drag City label.\n\nBerman is best remembered for his work with indie-rock band the Silver Jews. Although the band primarily existed as a recording project for most of its existence, in January 2009 Berman announced his retirement from music in hopes of finding a meaningful way of undoing the damage that his estranged father Richard (a lobbyist for the alcohol and firearm industries) had brought upon society. In early 2019, Berman returned to music under the new band name Purple Mountains, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 2019, which would be the final musical project attributed to him before his death on August 7, 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Purple+Mountains\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After a 10-year break professedly spent reading books and arguing with people on Reddit, Berman enlisted members of the Brooklyn band Woods to back him on <i>Purple Mountains</i>.<br />\nBerman’s pain had never been laid quite so bare, nor had it ever sounded quite so urgent. “I spent a decade playing chicken with oblivion,” he sings on the swaggering “That’s Just the Way I Feel”. “Day to day, I’m neck and neck with giving in.” And “Margaritas at the Mall” turns an ordinary happy hour into a jeremiad about the cold comforts of capitalism in a godless world. That the music—country-tinged indie rock—was as polished and competent as it was only highlighted Berman’s intensity: less a rock singer than a street preacher, someone who needed to avail himself of his visions stat.<br />\nBut even at his most desperate, he remained achingly funny, turning statements of existential loneliness into the kind of bumper sticker Zen that made him seem like an ordinary guy no matter how highfalutin he could get. “Well, if no one’s fond of fuckin’ me, maybe no one’s fuckin’ fond of me,” he sings on the album-closing “Maybe I’m the Only One for Me”, sounding not all that far off from the George Strait one-twos he reportedly loved.<br />\nAbove all, though, his writing is beautiful, attuned to detail in ways that make ordinary scenarios shimmer with quiet magic. Just listen to “Snow Is Falling in Manhattan”, which turns a quiet night in a big city into an allegory of finding solace in the weather of what comes to us.<br />\nShortly after the release of <i>Purple Mountains</i>, Berman died, at the age of 52, a tragic end to what felt like a triumphant return. “The dead know what they're doing when they leave this world behind,” he sings on “Nights That Won’t Happen”. “When the here and the hereafter momentarily align.”",
