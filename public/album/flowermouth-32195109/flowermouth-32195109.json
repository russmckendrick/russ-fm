      "biography": "No-Man is a British duo formed in 1987 by Tim Bowness and Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson.\n\nThe band has so far produced seven studio albums and a number of singles/outtakes collections (most notably, 2006's career retrospective, All the Blue Changes).\n\nOriginally a sample-based proto-Trip hop/Ambient/Electro-Pop styled music, No-Man's sound has become more organic, diverse and band-oriented in subsequent years. The band has been lauded \"Conceivably the most important English group since The Smiths\" by Melody Maker music newspaper.\n\nThe name No-Man was adopted in 1990 and first used on the self-released June 1990 single release, Colours (a cover of the 1960s Donovan song). The single achieved Melody Maker and Sounds (british music paper) \"Singles of the Week\" accolades and was re-released by Liverpool-based label Probe Plus in October, 1990.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1994, No-Man were managed by Talk Talk's manager Keith Aspden. During this period, the band received highly positive UK music media support (including more \"Singles of the Week\" in Melody Maker, Sounds and Irish music paper, Hot Press), had 2 indie top 20 hits (Days in the Trees and Ocean Song), a Billboard Top 40 dance hit (the US only single, Taking It Like a Man) and had high profile contracts with One Little Indian, Hit & Run Publishing and Epic/Sony.\n \nSubsequently, mirroring the evolution of artists such as Talk Talk, David Sylvian, Radiohead, Scott Walker and Kate Bush, with each successive release, the band has moved further away from its more conventional Pop/Rock roots.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, No-Man has released material via Snapper Music, Third Stone/Adasam and internet label, Burning Shed (www.burningshed.com).\n\nIncluded amongst the many artists and guest musicians the band has worked with are electronic artists Roger Eno, Faultline, Scanner, Muslimgauze and The Shamen, Jazz musicians Ian Carr and Theo Travis, and the legendary likes of King Crimson personnel, Robert Fripp, Pat Mastelotto and Mel Collins, and ex-Japan members, Steve Jansen, Richard Barbieri and Mick Karn.\n\nDrawing from a diverse mix of Singer-songwriter, Post Rock, Minimalist, Progressive rock, Jazz, and Contemporary Ambient sources for inspiration, No-Man's sound is distinctive, yet difficult to categorise.\n\nAs of 2012, No-Man live band members include Steven Bennett (keyboards), Pete Morgan (bass guitar), Michael Bearpark (guitar),  Steve Bingham (electric violin), and  Andy Booker (electronic drums).\n\nIn 2019, the duo released Love You To Bits. there first new record in over a decade.\n\nIn 2024, Tim, Steven and Ben released Housekeeping: The OLI Years, a retrospective box set covering the band's material from 1990 to 1994, as well as  Swagger: Lost Not Lost Volume One, 1989/1990, which included the original Swagger tape from 1990 and some demos from the time period. All three have expressed interest in making a new No-Man record in the near future. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/No-Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Minus Ben Coleman (although you'd never guess because he appears on seven of nine tracks), Tim Bowness and Steven Wilson were aided by Robert Fripp, Ian Carr, Steve Jansen, and Richard Barbieri (who recorded the excellent set Flame with Bowness in the same year). Beginning with the epic \"Angel Gets Caught in the Beauty Trap,\" which is almost ten minutes on the original and longer on the reissue, things flow as Bowness' soothing vocal gives way to solos by Carr and Fripp. \"You Grow More Beautiful\" is another hit that might have been, while \"Animal Ghost\" is what Arthur Ransom, the author of Swallows and Amazons, might have sounded like had he chosen music instead of literature — a very English affair with a meandering piano line (removed on the reissue) and flute solo. \"Soft Shoulders\" is the closest to a throwaway, but \"Shell of a Fighter\" restores order, an enthralling piece expanding to nearly eight minutes of lilting pastoral verse, quiet passages of electronics, and an all out storm of squally guitars and ferrocious drumming. \"Teardrop Falls,\" one of their best, is a paced yet graceful pop dance tune. Flowermouth has serenity, too, in \"Watching Over Me,\" which may have been better following \"Shell.\" \"Simple\" uses a sample courtesy of Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance, roaming through contemporary club beats to reach a haunting climax. \"Things Change\" is the endgame, with the lyrics \"You're leaving me behind you, I hate the way things change\" sung in earnest. Gentle again, giving way to Ben Coleman's blistering violin solo.
