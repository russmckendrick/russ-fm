  "biography": "Senser, a politically charged rap rock UK band, originally formed in South West London from a group of friends in the late 1980s. The initial line-up comprised Nick Michaelson (guitar), Heitham Al-Sayed (vocals), Kerstin Haigh (vocals), John Morgan (drums), James Barrett (bass) and Alan \"Hagos/Haggis\" Haggarty (engineer, producer, programmer) and in 1992 they were joined by Spiral Tribe D.J, Andy Clinton. The band toured in support of psychedelic rockers the Ozric Tentacles in 1992. In 1993 the band were signed to Ultimate Records.\n\nIn 1993 Senser released two indie singles on Ultimate — \"Eject\" and \"The Key\".\n\nIn March 1994 Senser released their third single, \"Switch\", which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 39. Senser's first album, Stacked Up, was released in May 1994, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 4.\n\nAt the beginning of 1995 Senser toured the UK supported by Skunk Anansie before setting off to tour the United States with Moby. It was during this tour that the band decided to split over musical differences. Al-Sayed and Morgan left to form a new band with Haggis called Lodestar. The remaining members of Senser found a new drummer, Paul Soden, and set about writing Senser's second album.\n\nDuring the spring of 1997 they recorded the second album. And in the summer of 1997 De-Senser released \"Om\".\n\nIn the summer of 1998 Kerstin was able to tour and the band released the second album, Asylum. Once again musical differences became apparent and in February 1999 the band decided to split.\n\nThe band, now with the original line-up in place, recorded and released their third studio album SCHEMAtic.\n\nIn 2009, they released How To Do Battle.\n\nIn 2013, they released their fifth album To the Capsules via Pledgemusic and toured with Erika Footman on vocals in place of Kerstin Haigh.\n\nSenser's song \"States of Mind\", from Stacked Up was used as the soundtrack to the well-known demoscene production State of Mind by Bomb.\n\nIn 2012 one of their songs was also used in the soundtrack to the film \"Learning Hebrew: A Gothsploitation Movie\".",

In 1992 they were joined by Spiral Tribe DJ, Andy Clinton.\\n\\nTheir music is a mix of rock, rap and electronic elements. Their first album, \\'Stacked Up\\', was released in 1994 and was one of the first rap/rock crossover records and the band are widely regarded as being pioneers of the \\'nu-metal\\' genre (Although the actual name and rise of the genre came about a number of years after \\'Stacked Up\\'s release) and are often attributed with the subsequent success of The Prodigy, who took rock and dance a step further.\\n\\nThey split up in 1999 and Heitham and John formed \\'Lodestar\\', a less electronic, more melodic, metal orientated 4-piece in which Heitham sang throughout, rather than rapped. Lodestar created one superb self-titled album before themselves calling it a day.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Kerstin lead the vocals on the next Senser album \\'Asylum\\' which had stronger dance roots, but still with the familiar thrashy guitar riffs. Although no where near as popular as Stacked Up, Asylum\\'s closer affiliation with D&B spawned numerous remixes, some of which accompanied the main album itself, making it a 2-CD release.\\n\\nIn 2003, Senser reformed in the original line-up, to work on a compilation of their 2 90\\'s albums. Their time together also spawned brand new material, released as the album \\'Schematic\\' in 2004. The new album brought back the old sound from Stacked Up but with noticeable melodic and dance influences from Lodestar and the Senser \\'Asylum\\' album. \\n\\nA new album \\'How To Do Battle\\' was released in September 2009, and Senser is currently on tour supporting the release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Senser\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
