      "biography": "Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou (25 June 1963 – 25 December 2016), known professionally as George Michael, was an English singer, songwriter, record producer, and philanthropist who rose to fame as a member of the music duo Wham! He was best known for his work in the 1980s and 1990s, including hit singles such as \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" and \"Last Christmas\", and albums such as Faith (1987) and Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 (1990).\n\nMichael sold more than 100 million records worldwide. His debut solo album, Faith, sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. Michael achieved seven number one singles in the UK and eight number one songs on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, including \"Careless Whisper\" and \"Praying for Time\". He ranks among the best-selling British acts of all time, and in 2008 he was ranked 40th on Billboard's list of the Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time. Michael won various music awards throughout his 30-year career, including three Brit Awards—he won Best British Male twice, four MTV Video Music Awards, four Ivor Novello Awards, three American Music Awards, and two Grammy Awards from eight nominations. Michael, who came out as gay in 1998, was an active LGBT rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser.\n\nIn 2004, the Radio Academy named Michael the most played artist on British radio during the period 1984–2004. The documentary A Different Story (released in 2005) covered his career and personal life. Michael's first tour in 15 years, the worldwide 25 Live tour, spanned three tours over the course of three years (2006, 2007, and 2008). In the early hours of 25 December 2016, Michael, aged 53, was found dead in bed at his Oxfordshire home.",

            "content": "Faith is George Michael's first solo album, released in October 1987 via Columbia Records/Epic Records. The album is considered by some to be one of the greatest albums in pop music history, and won several awards including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1989. The album was an instant commercial success in the United States, selling more than 1 million copies in its debut, the most copies ever sold in a week by a British pop artist. To date, the album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, and received diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Faith spawned six top 5 singles that substantially helped it dominate the chart of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 480 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nAfter the split of Wham!, Michael spent the most part of 1987 writing and recording the songs for his breakthrough project. In addition to playing a large number of instruments on the album, he wrote and produced every track on the recording except for one, \"Look at Your Hands\", which he co-wrote with David Austin. Using the then-revolutionary Synclavier 9600 Tapeless Studio, Faith was Michael's first digital recording. A contemporary R&B album, Faith showcases the vocals of Michael in a new-style mode. It features songs littered with introspective lyrics, generating controversies about Michael's personal relationships at that time.\n\nThe public speculated that 1988 was the year of George Michael. The success of the album put him in the mainstream, becoming the biggest artist of 1988. Others also said that George Michael might be the successor of Elton John.\n\nThe album earned George Michael numerous accolades. At the 31st Grammy Awards, he was nominated for the Album of the Year and won. George Michael racked up three wins at the 1989 American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Album for Faith.\n\nThe album became a massive success commercially. Between 1987 and 1988, Faith produced an amazing string of hit singles, including six Top 5 Billboard Hot 100 hits, four of which (\"Faith\", \"Father Figure\", \"One More Try\", and \"Monkey\") reached #1, making him the only British male singer to have four #1 singles from one LP on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also had impressive staying power, with 51 non-consecutive weeks inside the Billboard 200 Top 10, including 12 weeks at #1. It was also the first album by a white solo artist to hit #1 on the US R&B charts. It also reached #1 in the United Kingdom, where it stayed at the top spot for only one week. In all, it was the best-selling album of 1988 in the United States, and eventually reached Diamond certification by the RIAA. According to Nielsen/SoundScan, current sales stand at 11 million copies, making it the 52nd best-selling album in the United States.\n\nThe album peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, becoming Michael's first number-one solo album. Its early, and successive, success on the chart was said to be partly sustained—with help from plenty of press appearances and promotions—by its strong single releases. With \"I Want Your Sex\" propelling the album's debut atop the chart, \"Faith\", the second single off the album facilitated the album's continuing dominance as well. \"Faith\" was 1988's best-selling single in the United States; with \"Careless Whisper\" being the best-selling single in 1985, it honoured George Michael for being the first act to achieve two U.S. year-end #1 singles since 1968, when The Beatles had \"Hey Jude\" top the year-end singles chart after \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in 1964.\n\nThe album continued its dominance on the chart of 1988. The self-titled debut album by Tiffany ended its first week run at the top spot; however, Faith reclaimed the position the following week for five consecutive weeks. Over nine months after its release, Faith was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for 5 million U.S. shipments. To date, the album has sold twenty million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 1989, Faith was ranked #84 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 480 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Faith was ranked 79th in a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.\n\nWith sales of more than seven million in 1988, Faith was named in the United States as the most shipped album of the year. Along with the success of the American singer Michael Jackson's album Bad, as well as breakthrough albums by many new and old artists, it was seen as a sign that US record sales were slowly recovering. By the end of 1988, the industry had sold millions of albums, an increase of approximately one percent, as recorded by Nielsen SoundScan. Compared with record sales in 1987, this showed two percent of increase. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/George+Michael/Faith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
