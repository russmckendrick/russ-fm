      "biography": "Jon and Vangelis is the collaborative effort between the singer Jon Anderson (the lead vocalist of the progressive rock band Yes) and the Greek synthesizer musician Vangelis Papathanassiou. Together they released a number of successful albums in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1974, Vangelis was considered as a replacement for Rick Wakeman as keyboardist in Yes, and although the job went to Patrick Moraz, it led to several collaborations with Anderson, who contributed vocals to Vangelis' Heaven and Hell (1975), harp to Opera Sauvage (1979), and vocals to See You Later (1980).\nAnderson left Yes between 1980 and 1983, and during this time the collaboration with Vangelis began in earnest. The two recorded several albums between 1979 and 1991, producing the major hits \"I Hear You Now\" (UK No. 8), \"I'll Find My Way Home\" (UK No. 6) and \"The Friends of Mr. Cairo\" (Canada No. 1). Anderson wrote the lyrics, and Vangelis composed the music.\n\nIn 1986, Jon & Vangelis made a few attempts at writing a new album, but much of this work was never officially released under the Jon and Vangelis name. Twelve tracks were compiled on 1991's Page of Life, while other songs from these sessions appeared in later works, including \"Let's Pretend\", the last song on the 1989 album Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. Anderson ultimately took it upon himself to re-work Page of Life, which was released in 1998 in the United States only with nine tracks. Vangelis did not approve this, and it is cited as the reason for the dissolution of their collaboration. \"Sing With Your Eyes\" appeared in 1991, as a B-side on the CD single release of \"Wisdom Chain\" / \"Page of Life\".",

Short Stories actually marks their second collaboration -- the first took place on Vangelis' 1975 album, Heaven and Hell, with the track \"So Long Ago, So Clear.\" The pair returns to that song's successful formula of combining Anderson's otherworldly voice with Vangelis' pithy melodies in a few spots on their debut together, notably for the popular single \"I Hear You Now\" (which recalls Vangelis' \"To the Unknown Man\") and the middle section of \"Far Away in Bagaad.\" Otherwise, Short Stories favors amorphous arrangements that feature wisps of melody and little more (a style that has its precedent on Yes' Tormato rather than their own solo work to date). The effect can be, frankly, underwhelming -- \"Curious Electric\" and \"Each and Everyday,\" for example, seem content to settle for the happy accidents of collaboration rather than fusing their individual sounds into a cohesive whole. Despite a handful of nearly memorable moments, including the playful \"Thunder\" and the charming \"Love Is/One More Time,\" the pair would have had more success sticking to their established idioms -- after all, China and Olias of Sunhillow were good albums -- rather than trying to meet in some equidistant, ethereal plane. Given the record's paper-thin arrangements, an appreciation for the music of Vangelis and Jon Anderson is no guarantee that Short Stories will please.\n\nCredits\nJon Anderson - Vocals\nAlwyn Clayden - Artwork, Graphic Design\nMinoru Harada - Product Manager\nRaphael Preston - Guitar (Acoustic), Engineer\nVeronique Skawinska - Photography\nHitoshi Takiguchi - Mastering Engineer\nKiyoshi Tokiwa - Artwork\nVangelis - Synthesizer, Arranger, Keyboards, Multi Instruments, Producer, Design, Cover Design, Instrumentation\n\nChart & Awards\n1980 - I Hear You Now - The Billboard Hot 100 - Peak 58\n1980 - Short Stories - The Billboard 200 - Peak 125\nChart information courtesy of Billboard.com © 2006 VNU eMedia, Inc.
