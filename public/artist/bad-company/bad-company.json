  "biography": "Bad Company is a 1970s British blues-rock group fronted by Paul \"The Voice\" Rodgers. Their name came from a ‘70s Western movie and they were formed by former members of Mott the Hoople, Free, and King Crimson. Members were Paul Rodgers (singer/pianist), Mick Ralphs (guitarist), Boz Burrell (bassist), and Simon Kirke (drummer). \n\nTheir hits include “Shooting Star,” “Bad Company,” “Feel Like Makin’ Love,” “Rock ‘N’ Roll Fantasy,” \"Ready for Love,\" and “Can’t Get Enough,” most of which are off of the albums Straight Shooter and Bad Company. \n\nIn the mid 80`s Rodgers & Burrell left the band. New singer Brian Howe, who had worked with Ted Nugent earlier, made 4 albums with the band. Year 1990`s LP Holy water contained big hit \"If you needed somebody\". Their style was then more like melodic rock. \n\nIn mid 1990`s Howe left the band and solo artist Robert Hart replaced him. Also other guitarist Dave Colwell & basist Rick Wills joined to group. In 2000`s Paul Rodgers came back to make the new album with old band members Kirke, Ralphs & other guys. They got a hit with the song \"Joe Fabulous\" what was number 1 on Classic Rock Radio. After that recording all original members left the band and new line-up members came to band. Robert Hart became again the band´s singer.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Company\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
