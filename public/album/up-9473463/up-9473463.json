      "biography": "Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and activist. He rose to fame as the original lead singer of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, he launched a successful solo career with \"Solsbury Hill\" as his first single. His fifth studio album, So (1986), is his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. The album's most successful single, \"Sledgehammer\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards and, according to a report in 2011, it was MTV's most played music video of all time.\n\nGabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has also pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has also been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \"Biko\". He has participated in several human-rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the Witness human rights organisation in 1992. Gabriel developed The Elders with Richard Branson, which was launched by Nelson Mandela in 2007.\n\nGabriel has won three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male in 1987, six Grammy Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was made a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his \"influence on generations of music makers\". In recognition of his many years of human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize laureates in 2006, and Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. AllMusic has described Gabriel as \"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, followed by his induction as a solo artist in 2014. In March 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of South Australia in recognition of his achievements in music.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel\n\nStudio albums\nPeter Gabriel (1977; known as Peter Gabriel 1 and Car)\nPeter Gabriel (1978; known as Peter Gabriel 2 and Scratch)\nPeter Gabriel (1980; known as Peter Gabriel 3 and Melt)\nPeter Gabriel (1982; known as Peter Gabriel 4 and Security)\nSo (1986)\nUs (1992)\nUp (2002)\nScratch My Back (2010)\nNew Blood (2011)\ni/o (2023) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Up (2002) is the seventh studio and thirteenth album overall released by the British progressive rock musician Peter Gabriel.\n\nIn the Spring of 1995, Gabriel began work on the album. Its name was Up from the start, though at one point it was considered to be called I/O. Gabriel began saying the album was near completion somewhere around 1998 but did not release it until September of 2002. In the months preceding the album's release, video clips of Gabriel talking about the songs as well as short demos of each song were released at the coming of every full moon on Gabriel's official website.\n\nThe album's lyrics deal mostly with birth and especially death. The opening track, \"Darkness\", is a song about overcoming fears. \"Growing Up\" is a summation of life put to a pulsating beat. \"Sky Blue\" is a track Gabriel claims to have been working on for over 20 years before finishing it. The track \"No Way Out\" is the first track to deal with death solely, though death is a common theme across the entire album. \"I Grieve\" was conceived after Gabriel looked over his catalogue of music as if it were a catalogue of emotional tools. He found one major missing tool to be one to cope with death and therefore \"I Grieve\" was born (first aired in 1998, despite the popular belief that it was written in response to 9/11). The first single from Up, \"The Barry Williams Show\" is a down-beat, jazzy song dealing with reality talk shows such as Jerry Springer (in fact, Barry Williams did appear as himself in the music video for the song). The second single, \"More Than This\" is one of the more upbeat songs from the album. The song wonders over there being something more to life. The song \"Signal to Noise\" was a challenge for Gabriel because the guest vocalist for the track, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, died. All that was left to work with were recordings from a live performance of an early version of the song at the VH1 Witness show on April 28, 1996. Finally, \"The Drop\" consists of only Gabriel and a Bösendorfer grand piano.\n\nMany artists, including Trent Reznor and Elbow, remixed the tracks. These remixes were included as b-sides to the singles.\n\nThe song \"I Grieve\" is (in an earlier version) on the soundtrack from City of Angels (1998), as well as featuring in the Smallville episode \"Reckoning\". \"Signal to Noise\" appeared on the soundtrack from Gangs of New York (2002).\n\nThis album is also available on vinyl and hybrid multi-channel Super Audio CD. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Gabriel/Up\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
