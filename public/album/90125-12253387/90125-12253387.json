      "biography": "Yes are an English rock band who achieved success with their progressive, art and symphonic style of music. They are distinguished by their use of mystical and cosmic lyrics, live stage sets and lengthy compositions, often with complex instrumental and vocal arrangements. Seventeen musicians have been members of the band in its history; the current line-up since February 2012 consists of singer Jon Davison, guitarist Steve Howe, bass guitarist Chris Squire, keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Alan White.\nSquire formed Yes in 1968 with singer Jon Anderson. Squire and guitarist Peter Banks had played together in The Syn and then Mabel Greer's Toyshop. Anderson and later drummer Bill Bruford joined a later line-up of Mabel Greer's Toyshop, which evolved into Yes. Keyboardist Tony Kaye completed the first Yes line-up. Their first two albums received lukewarm sales and reception. Early sets were a mix of original material and cover versions by other artists. In the 1970s, Yes reached their creative peak in the progressive genre when most notably Anderson, Squire, Howe, Bruford, White, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman were part of the band's line-ups, and produced what many critics consider their finest works: The Yes Album, Fragile (both in 1971), Close to the Edge (1972), Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973), Relayer (1974) and Going for the One (1977). The rise of punk rock at the end of the decade led to a decline in creativity and sales; in 1980, Anderson and Wakeman left the band and the album Drama featuring Downes and new vocalist Trevor Horn was released. The following year, all band members except Howe and Downes left the band due to personal and musical differences; instead of continuing as Yes, they disbanded the group and created Asia.\nYes reformed in 1982 with Anderson, Squire, White, original keyboardist Kaye and guitarist Trevor Rabin and adopted a more pop rock sound. Their sales peaked across the decade with 90125 (1983), which spawned the US number one single \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and Big Generator (1987). The tour in support of Union (1991), which amalgamated members of Yes and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, was a commercial success that featured an eight-man line-up (instead of a quintet). Subsequent albums and singles have been commercially unsuccessful. The band toured worldwide between 1997 and 2004 that included their 30th and 35th anniversary shows. After a four-year hiatus due to health issues from Anderson and Wakeman, Yes resumed touring after replacing them with Benoît David and Oliver Wakeman respectively. In 2011 they released Fly from Here featuring Downes, who returned on keyboards after 30 years, and the following year David left the band due to illness and was replaced by Davison from band Glass Hammer.\nYes are one of the most popular, influent and critically acclaimed acts in the history of the progressive genre, and have influenced bands such as Dream Theater. Nine of their twenty studio albums have reached the top ten in either the UK or the US charts, with two reaching the number one spot in the UK. They have sold 13.5 million certified units in the US.",

            "content": "90125 is the eleventh album by progressive rock group Yes, released in 1983. It was the first album since the breakup of Yes in 1981. It is also the first album to feature Trevor Rabin, and also features the return of vocalist Jon Anderson, who quit the band in 1979. It also marked the first time in twelve years that original keyboardist Tony Kaye had appeared with the group. The album is notable for marking a radical shift in style, with Yes largely trading in their trademark symphonic progressive rock sound for contemporary, synthesized 1980's pop.\n\nThe title of the album refers to its original catalogue number, not an American ZIP code (which is not in use).\n\n\n\nBackground\nThis new incarnation of Yes came about almost by accident. In 1980, well-known members Jon Anderson (vocalist) and Rick Wakeman (keyboardist) had left the band, replaced by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes respectively. The new line-up was short-lived: after an album (Drama) and tour, they disbanded at the beginning of 1981. Bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White continued to work together, including on the abortive XYZ project and releasing a single as a duo in 1981.\n\nGuitarist Trevor Rabin had left his native South Africa in the late 1970s and had released a series of solo albums. There had been various attempts to place Rabin in a band, including a proposed quartet with Rick Wakeman, John Wetton and Carl Palmer in 1980 and a proposed trio with Keith Emerson and Jack Bruce. Rabin tried out in Asia, alongside Wetton, Palmer and former Yes members Steve Howe and Geoff Downes. However, he had also been put in touch with Squire and White and this was to be his path instead.\n\nSquire, White and Rabin began working together, initially considering some of the XYZ material. Trevor Horn was also associated with the nascent band from an early stage as the band's producer and, at one point, it was considered having him as the lead vocalist.\n\nThe band needed a keyboard player. Eddie Jobson was approached, but rejected the post. Instead, the trio were joined by none other than original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye, who had been fired in 1971. They christened themselves \"Cinema\" and began recording what they thought was their debut album, comprising mainly of original music Rabin had originally earmarked for a solo album, and produced by Horn.\n\nEverything changed in the spring of 1983 when Jon Anderson was played some of Cinema's recordings by Squire. When Anderson professed interest and became keen to join, it was realized that Yes, essentially, were reforming. Rabin was dubious at first, not wanting to be perceived as Steve Howe's replacement, but rather the lead guitarist for a new group. However, he quickly changed his mind once Anderson brought in some new lyrics and put his distinctive vocals on the existing music tracks. Thus, after a three-year gap, Yes was back.\n\nHowever, due to a falling out with album producer Horn, Kaye left the sessions during the recording of 90125, with much of the keyboard work on the album being played by Rabin or Horn's hand-picked production team. When the band started preparing for a tour to support the album, Eddie Jobson was again asked to join, which he accepted. Jobson appeared in the video for the first single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". In order to consolidate the legal position that this band was YES, Kaye was brought back. Jobson, unwilling to share the role of keyboard player, dropped out.\n\n\nRelease\nReleased that Autumn on Atlantic Records' subsidiary, Atco, 90125 launched Yes to the MTV age and to a whole new breed of fans. The music was catchy, contemporary and well-liked by reviewers and their new fans (many of whom had little clue of the band's previous incarnation). The lead single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart,\" became the band's first (and only) US #1 hit, driving 90125 to the Top 5 and helping it sell three million units, by far Yes's most successful album. The British sales were not as spectacular, but still solid, and successive hits, such as \"Leave It\" and \"It Can Happen\" ensured 90125 had a lengthy chart life. In addition, \"Cinema\" won the 1984 Grammy for the best rock instrumental, despite having no easily-discernible time signature.\n\nThe album's logo was created and designed by Garry Mouat at Assorted Images on an Apple IIe computer, which would be used on Yes's next studio album Big Generator as well. 90125 (Atco 790 125) reached #16 in the UK. It also reached #5 in the US during a chart stay of 53 weeks.\n\nRecently in 2005, a Max Graham remix of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" reached #9 in the UK singles charts, bettering the original's #28 peak.\n\n\n Contribution of Producer Trevor Horn\nThe album's great success was owed in no small part to the skills of its producer Trevor Horn, effectively the sixth member of the band during the making of the album; he is also credited with some of the songwriting. Horn was vocalist on Yes's previous album Drama (1980), but subsequently left to pursue full-time production work. Often lauded in the early 1980s for using the recording studio as an instrument in itself, he gave 90125 a clarity and sheen that made it very distinctive for the era. He skillfully exploited the then-new technology of digital sampling to achieve not only dazzling orchestral and vocal effects (witness the tracks Owner of a Lonely Heart, Leave It and City of Love), but also prominent usage of textural sounds which up until then were generally foreign to rock music. For example, to add interest, atmosphere or depth to the mix, Horn would mix in unexpected audio segments, such as the introduction to City of Love, which uses a sample from the opening of the 1924 orchestral piece Fountains of Rome by Italian composer Ottorino Respighi, faded in beneath a two-note bass guitar riff. (This in itself subtly reveals that the City of Love is Rome). And history repeated itself... a testament to Horn's pioneering achievement here is that snippets from Horn's own production (particularly complex vocal harmonies) were themselves later used as raw musical material by several high-profile artists, such as US jazzman Herbie Hancock and UK dance act Orbital.\n\n\nRemix albums\nYes released an album on the Atlantic label (ATCO Records) in 1984 called \"Twelve Inches on Tape\" (released on album as well, title unavailable). This (now) rarity offered listeners 4 remixes of their chart-topping singles of \"Leave It\" and \"Owner Of A Lonely Heart.\" The track listing from \"Twelve inches on tape\" (4 \"mixes\" in total):\n\n\"Leave It\" (Remix) (Chris Squire/Trevor Rabin/Trevor Horn) \nProduced by Trevor Horn.

Thus, after a three-year gap, Yes was back.\n\nHowever, due to a falling out with album producer Horn, Kaye left the sessions during the recording of 90125, with much of the keyboard work on the album being played by Rabin or Horn's hand-picked production team. When the band started preparing for a tour to support the album, Eddie Jobson was again asked to join, which he accepted. Jobson appeared in the video for the first single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". In order to consolidate the legal position that this band was YES, Kaye was brought back. Jobson, unwilling to share the role of keyboard player, dropped out.\n\n\nRelease\nReleased that Autumn on Atlantic Records' subsidiary, Atco, 90125 launched Yes to the MTV age and to a whole new breed of fans. The music was catchy, contemporary and well-liked by reviewers and their new fans (many of whom had little clue of the band's previous incarnation). The lead single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart,\" became the band's first (and only) US #1 hit, driving 90125 to the Top 5 and helping it sell three million units, by far Yes's most successful album. The British sales were not as spectacular, but still solid, and successive hits, such as \"Leave It\" and \"It Can Happen\" ensured 90125 had a lengthy chart life. In addition, \"Cinema\" won the 1984 Grammy for the best rock instrumental, despite having no easily-discernible time signature.\n\nThe album's logo was created and designed by Garry Mouat at Assorted Images on an Apple IIe computer, which would be used on Yes's next studio album Big Generator as well. 90125 (Atco 790 125) reached #16 in the UK. It also reached #5 in the US during a chart stay of 53 weeks.\n\nRecently in 2005, a Max Graham remix of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" reached #9 in the UK singles charts, bettering the original's #28 peak.\n\n\n Contribution of Producer Trevor Horn\nThe album's great success was owed in no small part to the skills of its producer Trevor Horn, effectively the sixth member of the band during the making of the album; he is also credited with some of the songwriting. Horn was vocalist on Yes's previous album Drama (1980), but subsequently left to pursue full-time production work. Often lauded in the early 1980s for using the recording studio as an instrument in itself, he gave 90125 a clarity and sheen that made it very distinctive for the era. He skillfully exploited the then-new technology of digital sampling to achieve not only dazzling orchestral and vocal effects (witness the tracks Owner of a Lonely Heart, Leave It and City of Love), but also prominent usage of textural sounds which up until then were generally foreign to rock music. For example, to add interest, atmosphere or depth to the mix, Horn would mix in unexpected audio segments, such as the introduction to City of Love, which uses a sample from the opening of the 1924 orchestral piece Fountains of Rome by Italian composer Ottorino Respighi, faded in beneath a two-note bass guitar riff. (This in itself subtly reveals that the City of Love is Rome). And history repeated itself... a testament to Horn's pioneering achievement here is that snippets from Horn's own production (particularly complex vocal harmonies) were themselves later used as raw musical material by several high-profile artists, such as US jazzman Herbie Hancock and UK dance act Orbital.\n\n\nRemix albums\nYes released an album on the Atlantic label (ATCO Records) in 1984 called \"Twelve Inches on Tape\" (released on album as well, title unavailable). This (now) rarity offered listeners 4 remixes of their chart-topping singles of \"Leave It\" and \"Owner Of A Lonely Heart.\" The track listing from \"Twelve inches on tape\" (4 \"mixes\" in total):\n\n\"Leave It\" (Remix) (Chris Squire/Trevor Rabin/Trevor Horn) \nProduced by Trevor Horn.

      "wiki_summary": "90125 is the eleventh album by progressive rock group Yes, released in 1983. It was the first album since the breakup of Yes in 1981. It is also the first album to feature Trevor Rabin, and also features the return of vocalist Jon Anderson, who quit the band in 1979. It also marked the first time in twelve years that original keyboardist Tony Kaye had appeared with the group. The album is notable for marking a radical shift in style, with Yes largely trading in their trademark symphonic progressive rock sound for contemporary, synthesized 1980's pop.
