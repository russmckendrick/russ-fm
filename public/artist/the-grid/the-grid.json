  "biography": "The Grid is an English group/production group for electronic music, that consists of Richard Norris and David Ball (mostly Dave Ball as a solo artist and formerly of Soft Cell).\n\nTheir 1994 single \"Swamp Thing\", which featured elaborate banjo lines (played by Roger Dinsdale) over house beats was widely popular in the UK and Australia, reaching number forty-four on the 1994 Triple J Hottest 100. The Grid's 1994 album Evolver, which contained the \"Swamp Thing\" single, reached number fourteen in the UK charts. \"Swamp Thing\" was also released in 1995 on Triple J's Hottest 100 Volume 2 compilation. Other songs by The Grid include Texas Cowboys, Rollercoaster and Flotation.\n\nAfter splitting up to pursue individual music interests in 1996, the duo re-formed in 2003. By 2006 the pair were reportedly to have been recording new studio tracks. In early 2006 the band began touring under the name GDM with female singer Misty Woods.\n\nDave Ball reunited with Marc Almond for a new Soft Cell album and tour in 2002-3.\nRichard Norris is currently working with Erol Alkan under the moniker Beyond the Wizard's Sleeve, under which they released an album of acid rock re-edits called \"Spring\" in the summer of 2006.\n\nThe band released a new album in 2008 called Doppelgänger and performed some live shows. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Grid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
