      "biography": "Steve Earle is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, author and actor. Earle grew up near San Antonio, Texas, and began learning the guitar at age 11. Earle began his career as a songwriter in Nashville and released his first EP in 1982. His breakthrough album was the 1986 Guitar Town. Since then Earle has released 13 other studio albums and received three Grammy awards. His songs have been recorded by Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Shawn Colvin and Emmylou Harris. \n\nHe has appeared in film and television, and has written a novel, a play, and a book of short stories. Earle was born Stephen Fain Earle in Fort Monroe, Virginia, and grew up near San Antonio, Texas. His father, Jack Earle, was an air traffic controller and his mother took part in anti-death penalty vigils. Although he was born in Virginia where his father was stationed, the family returned to Texas before Earle's second birthday. They moved several times but Earle grew up primarily in the San Antonio area. \n\nEarle began learning the guitar at the age of 11 and placed in a talent contest at his school at age 13. He is reported to have run away from home at age 14 to follow his idol, singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt around Texas. Earle was \"rebellious\" as a youngster and dropped out of school at the age of 16. He moved to Houston with his 19-year-old uncle, who was also a musician, where he married and worked odd jobs. While in Houston Earle finally met Van Zandt, who became his hero and role model. In 1974 at the age of 19 Earle moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and began working blue-collar jobs during the day and playing music at night. During this period Earle wrote songs and played bass guitar in Guy Clark's band and on Clark's 1975 album Old No. 1. Earle appeared in the 1975 film Heartworn Highways, a documentary on the Nashville music scene which included Guy Clark, Townes van Zandt and Rodney Crowell. Earle lived in Nashville for several years and obtained a job as a staff songwriter for a publishing company called Sunbury Dunbar. \n\nLater Earle grew tired of Nashville and returned to Texas where he started a band called The Dukes.",

The title track (a FM rock favorite) and \"The Devil's Right Hand\" roar with the defiance of a Confederate guerilla force, with Earle's vocals ringing with feverish desperation. Softer tunes like \"Nothing but a Child\" (a tender nativity song) take the edge off the anger. Another highpoint, \"Johnny Come Lately,\" matches him with the Pogues for a galloping Irish-Appalachian romp. At this point in his career, Earle was veering away from Nashville's restrictions and reveling in his own potent country/rock/folk blend fearlessly. He's gone on to release other outstanding albums, but <i>Copperhead Road</i> is unmatched for its musical ferocity and fine-etched lyrical insights.
