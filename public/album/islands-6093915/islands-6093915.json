      "biography": "King Crimson were a progressive rock band formed in 1968 in London, England. The band draws inspiration from a wide variety of music, incorporating elements of classical, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, industrial, electronic, experimental music and new wave. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock movement, including on contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and continue to inspire subsequent generations of artists across multiple genres. The band has earned a large cult following.\n\nFounded by Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald and lyricist Peter Sinfield, the band initially focused on a dramatic sound layered with Mellotron, McDonald's saxophone and flute, and Lake's powerful lead vocals. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release, with a potent mixture of jazz, classical and experimental music. Following the sudden simultaneous departures of McDonald and Giles, with Lake also leaving very shortly afterwards, Fripp and Sinfield assumed direction of the group for In the Wake of Poseidon (1970), Lizard (1970), and Islands (1971) with Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace among the band members during this period. In 1972, Fripp changed the group's instrumentation and approach, drawing from European free improvisation, and developing ever more complex compositions. With Bill Bruford, John Wetton, David Cross and briefly, Jamie Muir, they reached what some saw as a creative peak on Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). Fripp disbanded this group in 1974.\n\nIn 1981, Fripp and Bruford reformed King Crimson with another change in musical direction. The new group also included Adrian Belew and Tony Levin. They drew influence from African music, gamelan, post-punk and New York minimalism. This group lasted three years, resulting in the trio of albums Discipline (1981), Beat (1982) and Three of a Perfect Pair (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group as a sextet he called the \"double trio\" in 1994 adding Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn. This group participated in another three-year cycle of activity that included the release of Thrak (1995), and multiple concert recordings. There was a hiatus between 1997 to 2000. Four members of the previous sextet reunited in 2000 as a more industrial-oriented King Crimson, called the \"double duo\", releasing The Construkction of Light (2000) and The Power to Believe (2003). After a five year hiatus, the group expanded (in the person of new second drummer Gavin Harrison) for a 2008 tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1968 formation.\n\nFollowing another hiatus (2009–2012), during which Fripp was thought to be retired, King Crimson came together again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline, and new second guitarist and singer Jakko Jakszyk. This version of King Crimson continued to tour from 2014 to 2021, and released multiple live albums, rearranging and reinterpreting music from across the band's entire 50-year career for the first time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KingCrimson\n\nStudio albums\nIn the Court of the Crimson King (1969)\nIn the Wake of Poseidon (1970)\nLizard (1970)\nIslands (1971)\nLarks' Tongues in Aspic (1973)\nStarless and Bible Black (1974)\nRed (1974)\nDiscipline (1981)\nBeat (1982)\nThree of a Perfect Pair (1984)\nThrak (1995)\nThe Construkction of Light (2000)\nThe Power to Believe (2003)\n\n(NOTE: Album covers, band images and YouTube links are not available due to certain legal restrictions imposed on Last.fm by King Crimson's management.) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Crimson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Elsewhere, the band seeks to provoke the senses, not least with the spiky, lurching groove of “Ladies of the Road”, which sounds like The Beatles attempting <i>Bitches Brew</i>. Robert Fripp’s sonic ingenuity continues to blossom on “Sailor’s Tale,” in which his sustained guitar notes melt into a small symphony of glassy groans.",

          "standard": "The title track of <i>Islands</i> is a melancholic trance that outlines a mood of unattainable tranquility. Sung by new bassist Boz Burrell, it’s a strikingly patient and uncluttered ballad, and one of Crimson’s most delicate moments. Elsewhere, the band seeks to provoke the senses, not least with the spiky, lurching groove of “Ladies of the Road”, which sounds like The Beatles attempting <i>Bitches Brew</i>. Robert Fripp’s sonic ingenuity continues to blossom on “Sailor’s Tale,” in which his sustained guitar notes melt into a small symphony of glassy groans."

            "content": "Islands is the fourth studio album by English band King Crimson, released in December 1971 on the record label Island. Islands is the only studio album to feature the 1971-1972 touring line-up of Robert Fripp, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace. This would be the last album before an entirely new group (except for Fripp) would record the trilogy of Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Starless and Bible Black and Red between 1973-1974. This is also the last album to feature the lyrics of co-founding member Peter Sinfield. The album received a mixed response from critics.\n\nThe harmonic basis for the tune \"The Letters\" is derived from the Giles, Giles and Fripp song \"Why Don't You Just Drop In\", available on The Brondesbury Tapes compilation. The bridge section is also taken from the King Crimson version of the song, performed by the original line-up, titled simply \"Drop In\" and later released on the live-album Epitaph.\n\nThe lyrics to \"Ladies of the Road\" are a series of male sexual fantasies revolving around \"girls of the road\", i.e. groupies. Lyricist Peter Sinfield later commented on the song: \"... everybody writes at least one groupie song. We shouldn't. But we do. It is the ultimate sexist lyric of all time. I couldn't imagine anyone taking it too seriously, because in those days you were still able to say things like 'my lady' with a capital M and a capital L.\" \n\nThe original basis for the song \"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\" is derived from the Giles, Giles and Fripp song \"Suite No. 1\".\n\nThe first vinyl release of the album features a hidden track. At the end of side two there is a recording of studio chatter followed by Fripp saying, among other things, \"...What we're going to do, umm... do it twice more, once with the oboe, once without it, and then... we finish.\" This was included on the initial CD release but was accidentally left off the first pressings of the 1989 Definitive Edition CD remaster. It was restored on all subsequent reissues, and has been used as \"walk on\" music for all shows starting in 2014.\n\nReleased on 3 December 1971, Islands reached number 30 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was re-released in 2010 as the fifth release in King Crimson's 40th Anniversary series, featuring new stereo and 5.1 surround mixes by Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp, Sid Smith sleeve notes and extra tracks and alternative versions. The DVD-A presents a 5.1 surround sound mix by Wilson, a hi-res stereo version of the 2010 mix, a hi-res stereo version of the original album mix taken from the 30th anniversary master source and previously unreleased material, including studio takes mixed from the original recording sessions. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/King+Crimson/Islands\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
