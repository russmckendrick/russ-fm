      "biography": "Talking Heads were a new wave band which formed in 1975 in New York City, New York, United States. The band originally consisted of David Byrne (vocals, guitar), Tina Weymouth (bass) and Chris Frantz (drums), who had met while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. The band added Jerry Harrison (keyboards & guitar) in April 1977. The band released eight studio albums before disbanding in 1991. Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nTalking Heads first appeared on the New York music scene as a trio in 1974. At the time, the band consisted only of Byrne and Frantz, and was initially called The Artistics. By 1975, the band had recorded a demo album for CBS Records and landed a gig opening for the Ramones at CBGB in June 1975, which was the first time the band used the name Talking Heads. The band was signed to Sire Records in late 1976 and the group released their first single, \"Love → Building on Fire\" in February 1977. In March 1977, the band added Jerry Harrison, formerly of Jonathan Richman's band The Modern Lovers.  \n\nTheir first album, Talking Heads: 77 was released soon afterward and did not contain the earlier single, although it did include the underground singles Psycho Killer and Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town. Despite being regulars at New York's legendary CBGB, the band only began to break through further with the landmark Brian Eno-produced, 1978 album More Songs About Buildings And Food, an album which continued in the same vein, but with a more accessible style, wittier lyrics, and ultimately better songs. It was a great critical hit with subject matter ranging from home movies to the art world.  It also included their cover of Take Me To The River. On the following year's Fear Of Music the band started to dabble in African rhythms, notably on I Zimbra, and more straightforward pop styles, on Life During Wartime and Cities.\n\n1980 brought the band's fourth and most innovative effort Remain In Light. Notable for the single Once In A Lifetime, which became an early MTV staple, Remain In Light saw the band experiment with ambient sounds, fugal structures, polyrhythms, and about everything under the sun to make the body groove. Following this, the group split with Brian Eno, enjoying greater commercial success with 1983's Speaking In Tongues. It took the musical innovations of its predecessor and refined them into pop songs, most notably Burning Down The House, Girlfriend Is Better and This Must Be The Place. This period was topped off with a live album, from Jonathan Demme's documentary, Stop Making Sense. The documentary, with its name taken from a line in Girlfriend Is Better, was a great success, and took their inimitable style to a wider audience.\n\n1985's Little Creatures was an even bigger hit, and exhibited another stylistic shift for the band. It saw the punk styles of '77 almost completely abandoned for simple, three or four chord pop songs. The album produced the singles And She Was, and Road To Nowhere. The following two albums, True Stories and Naked, were both moderate successes, the former producing their biggest radio hits, Love For Sale and Wild Wild Life,  and the latter focusing more on Latin influences with hits like (Nothing But) Flowers.  After this, a long quiet period followed, with the band eventually officially announcing their break up in 1991. Since the split, Byrne continued his solo career and Weymoth and Frantz continued to record and tour as Tom Tom Club. Weymouth, Harrison and Frantz reunited for an album, \"No Talking, Just Head\", recorded under the name The Heads in 1996.\n\nThe band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. The band reunited for a three song performance at the ceremony. Due to personality conflicts between Byrne and the other members, further reunions are unlikely.\n\nwww.talking-heads.net <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "editorial_notes": "All four band members had taken a break to do side projects: Singer David Byrne wrote a solo album, <i>The Catherine Wheel</i>, guitarist and keyboardist Jerry Harrison did the same with <i>The Red and the Black</i> and drummer Chris Frantz and bassist Tina Weymouth formed Tom Tom Club and had a massive hit, “Genius of Love”. When Talking Heads regrouped for their fifth studio album, <i>Speaking in Tongues</i>, there were plenty of new ideas to integrate. \n\n“Slippery People” could almost be a <i>Remain in Light</i> outtake, thanks to background vocals by Nona Hendryx and Dolette McDonald. But working without producer Brian Eno for the first time in years, the band chose a less layered sound. Byrne later called it “a lighter record,” and there isn’t even one song about a terrorist.\n\nThe arrangements largely swap guitars for synthesisers and other keyboards. Keyboardist Wally Badarou added some fun but ghostly sounds to “Burning Down the House”, Talking Heads’ first (and, it turned out, only) single that reached the Top 10. The title derived from a chant Frantz heard at a concert by the ecstatic funk group Parliament-Funkadelic: “Burn down the house! Burn down the house!” \n\nThe music is more playful and expansive than before: “Swamp” is a trip downriver into the blues, “Making Flippy Floppy” features the Indian violinist L. Shankar, and “Moon Rocks” offers a touch of reggae. The lyrics are often giddy, which is new: “Some things sure can sweep me off my feet,” Byrne declares in “Burning Down the House”. They’re also often imagistic and hard to fathom—if you think you know what “Watch out/Touch monkeys” means, please tell the rest of us. \n\nBut the newest touch comes at the end. The tender, midtempo song “This Must Be the Place (Naïve Melody)” features the most direct love lyrics Byrne had ever written. There’s a strong feeling of surprise or even confusion in the song, which also includes some tender images. (“Sing into my mouth” was inspired by a photo he’d seen of an unusual Inuit musical custom.) It’s the most frequently covered Talking Heads song: The Lumineers, Iron & Wine, Ivan Neville and Shawn Colvin have all recorded it, and it’s popular at weddings, if not quite as popular as “We’ve Only Just Begun”. It’s a beautiful song, and startling to hear the guy who sang the misanthropic song “The Big Country” a few years earlier now pining for home comforts.",

            "content": "\"Speaking in Tongues\" is the fifth studio album by American rock band Talking Heads, released on June 1, 1983, by Sire Records. After their split with producer Brian Eno and a short hiatus, which allowed the individual members to pursue side projects, recording began in 1982. It became the band's commercial breakthrough and produced the band's sole US top-ten hit, \"Burning Down the House\".\n\nThe album's tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's 1984 film Stop Making Sense, which generated a live album of the same name. The album also crossed over to the dance charts, where it peaked at number two for six weeks. It is the group's highest-charting album on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 15. It was also their biggest-selling album in Canada, where it was certified platinum in 1983.\n\nDavid Byrne designed the cover for the general release of the album. Artist Robert Rauschenberg won a Grammy Award for his work on the limited-edition LP version. This album featured a clear vinyl disc in clear plastic packaging along with three clear plastic discs printed with similar collages in three different colors.\n\nOriginal cassette and later CD copies of the album have \"extended versions\" of \"Making Flippy Floppy\", \"Girlfriend Is Better\", \"Slippery People\", \"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\" and \"Moon Rocks\". The album was re-released in February 2006 as a remastered DualDisc. It contains the extended versions of the songs found on the original cassette, and includes two additional tracks (\"Two Note Swivel\" and an alternate mix of \"Burning Down the House\"). The DVD-A side includes both stereo and 5.1 surround high resolution (96 kHz/24bit) mixes, as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1 version of the album, a new alternate version of \"Burning Down the House\" with the emphasis on experimenting with the possibilities of surround sound, and videos for \"Burning Down the House\" and \"This Must Be the Place\" (videos are two-channel Dolby Digital only). In Europe it was released as a CD+DVDA two-disc set rather than a single DualDisc. The reissue was produced by Andy Zax with Talking Heads.\n\nByrne has said, as a partial explanation of the album's title, \"I originally sang nonsense, and uh, made words to fit that. That worked out all right.\"\n\nIn 2021, Rhino Entertainment re-released the album on sky blue vinyl.\n\nRolling Stone's David Fricke lauded the album's crossover nature, calling it \"the album that finally obliterates the thin line separating arty white pop music and deep black funk.\" He elaborated that the songs are all true art rock, with the complexity and sophistication of the genre, yet avoid art rock's characteristic pretensions with a laid-back attitude and compelling dance rhythms, making it an ideal party album.\n\nIn 1989, \"Speaking in Tongues\" was ranked number 54 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s. In 2012, Slant Magazine listed it as the 89th best album of the 1980s.\n\nReviewing the album for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann said: \"Talking Heads found a way to open up the dense textures of the music they had developed with Brian Eno on their two previous studio albums for \"Speaking in Tongues\", and were rewarded with their most popular album yet. Ten backup singers and musicians accompanied the original quartet, but somehow the sound was more spacious, and the music admitted aspects of gospel, notably in the call-and-response of 'Slippery People,' and John Lee Hooker-style blues, on 'Swamp.' As usual, David Byrne determinedly sang and chanted impressionistic, nonlinear lyrics, sometimes by mix-and-matching clichés… Some of his charming goofiness had returned since the overly serious Remain in Light and Fear of Music, and the accompanying music, filled with odd percussive and synthesizer sounds, could be unusually light and bouncy.\" In his book on funk music, Rickey Vincent describes \"Speaking in Tongues\" as \"deeply thumping funk disguised as modern rock.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads/Speaking+in+Tongues\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ten backup singers and musicians accompanied the original quartet, but somehow the sound was more spacious, and the music admitted aspects of gospel, notably in the call-and-response of 'Slippery People,' and John Lee Hooker-style blues, on 'Swamp.' As usual, David Byrne determinedly sang and chanted impressionistic, nonlinear lyrics, sometimes by mix-and-matching clichés… Some of his charming goofiness had returned since the overly serious Remain in Light and Fear of Music, and the accompanying music, filled with odd percussive and synthesizer sounds, could be unusually light and bouncy.\" In his book on funk music, Rickey Vincent describes \"Speaking in Tongues\" as \"deeply thumping funk disguised as modern rock.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads/Speaking+in+Tongues\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

      "wiki_summary": "\"Speaking in Tongues\" is the fifth studio album by American rock band Talking Heads, released on June 1, 1983, by Sire Records. After their split with producer Brian Eno and a short hiatus, which allowed the individual members to pursue side projects, recording began in 1982. It became the band's commercial breakthrough and produced the band's sole US top-ten hit, \"Burning Down the House\". The album's tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's 1984 film Stop Making Sense, which generated a live album of the same name. The album also crossed over to the dance charts, where it peaked at number <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads/Speaking+in+Tongues\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
