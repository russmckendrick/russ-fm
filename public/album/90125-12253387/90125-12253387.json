      "biography": "Yes are a British progressive rock band which formed in London, United Kingdom in 1968. They are best known for 1970's \"I've Seen All Good People\", the 1972 9-minute US Top 20 smash \"Roundabout\" and their 1983 #1 hit \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits and the influence of the many changes in popular music, the band has endured for 40 years and still retains a strong international following. Their music is marked by sharp dynamic contrasts, lush harmonies, often extended song lengths and a general showcasing of members' instrumental prowess. Arguably one of the most musically ambitious bands of their genre, Yes manages to use symphonic and other so-called \"classical\" structures with their own blend of musical styles - including some innovations - in a happy constructive \"marriage\" of music.\n\nThe original line-up consisted of Jon Anderson (vocals), Chris Squire (bass, vocals), Peter Banks (guitar, vocals), Tony Kaye (keyboards), and Bill Bruford (drums). Personnel changes brought musicians Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman into the group in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Steve Howe appears on the cover of Time and a Word, even though soon-to-be-ousted Pete Banks is the guitarist on the album. Alan White then replaced Bill Bruford in 1972.  These changes had arguably the biggest influence on their music and subsequent success. The early 1970's saw Yes as one of the few influential mainstream progressive acts.\n\nFor some fans, the double-album, four-track 1973 recording Tales from Topographic Oceans - symphonic and oddly mystical, marked a point of departure. It generally received a critical mauling in the press yet went straight to No. 1 in the UK album charts. Those listeners taken by the Tales album would be enthralled by 1974's Relayer - the only album that Patrick Moraz played keyboards on - which mixed progressive rock and a jazz fusion style that at times was very free in tunes such as \"The Gates of Delirium\". Far from their pop beginnings, this album marked a milestone for the band and for progressive rock as a whole.\n\nDuring the rise of the progressive genre, Yes pioneered the use of synthesizers and sound effects, gaining large popularity with their unique brand of mysticism and grand-scale compositions. Fragile (1971) and Close to the Edge (1972) are considered their best works - symphonic, complex, cerebral, spiritual and moving. These albums featured beautiful harmonies and strong, occasionally heavy playing. Also, Fragile contained the popular hit song \"Roundabout\". With the advent of punk in 1977, many considered progressive rock dead in the water. Yes, however, proved them wrong by releasing one of their most successful albums - Going for the One, which contained \"Awaken\", a rhythmic tour-de-force.\n\nIn 1979, Anderson and Wakeman left the band after unsuccessful recording sessions in Paris.  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (from the new-wave band The Buggles of \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" fame) were recruited to replace them, and the band recorded Drama, their first album without Anderson on vocals.  The resulting sound was much heavier than previous albums, particularly the opening track Machine Messiah, and a strong synth-pop influence due to the involvement of Downes and Horn, which drew some criticism and the dismissive label \"Yuggles\".  While the new Yes was well-received in America, the band encountered more hostile audiences in England.   The group split up in 1981.\n\nThe band reformed in 1983 with a new lineup featuring Squire, White, South African guitarist Trevor Rabin, and the return of Jon Anderson on vocals and Tony Kaye on keyboards.  This line-up, which was eventually nicknamed \"Yes West\", recorded 90125 and Big Generator and enjoyed a resurgence in popularity.  During these years, Yes championed digital sampling technologies and sold millions of records, influencing a generation of digital musicians with hits such as \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" and \"Rhythm of Love\".\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Jon Anderson formed a side project with former Yes members Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Bill Bruford, releasing Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe in 1989.  This led to a merger in 1990 and the album Union and the following tour with all 8 members.  However, while the tour and album were commercial successes, many of the band members were dissatisfied with the album.  Union was comprised of a demo recorded by the \"Yes West\" lineup attached to what was originally recorded as the second Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album, and was finished using session musicians.  Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit.\n\nThe \"Yes West\" lineup went on to release Talk in 1994, but sales were poor, and in 1995 Rabin and Kaye left the band.  Howe and Wakeman re-joined to produce the albums Keys to Ascension in 1996 and Keys to Ascension 2 in 1997, which featured both live performances and new studio tracks, returning to their progressive style of the 1970s.  Wakeman left the band shortly thereafter due to disagreements about the albums and tour.\n\nThe band collaborated with Billy Sherwood to produce the album Open Your Eyes in 1998, and Sherwood became an official member at the end of the sessions due to his significant contributions.  Igor Khoroshev also performed on a few tracks and performed on the following tour, eventually becoming a full member as well.\n\nMoving through the 1990s and into the new millennium, the band has moved back towards progressive influenced music and today keeps pushing the boundaries by using the latest hard-disk recording techniques.\n\nIn 1999 they worked with Relic Entertainment, providing the song \"Homeworld (The Ladder)\" for the PC game Homeworld. Although Sierra Entertainment later released a CD with the soundtrack they, for no apparent reason, chose not to include this song on the CD. It can however be found on the 1999 album The Ladder.\n\nAfter the departure of Sherwood in 2000 and Khoroshev in 2001, Yes recorded Magnification in 2001 without a keyboardist, instead featuring a full orchestra.  Rick Wakeman re-joined the band the next year, and in 2003 the band recorded five tracks that were added as a 3rd CD in the compilation Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversay Collection, including acoustic versions of \"Roundabout\" and \"South Side of the Sky\".\n\nIn 2008, when the band was about to begin their 40th anniversary tour, Jon Anderson suffered from a throat infection and was unable to participate.  Benoit David, from Canadian Progressive Rock band Mystery and Yes tribute band Close To The Edge, was recruited to fill in on vocals for the tour.  In 2009, he was named as Anderson's permanent replacement.  Rick Wakeman's son Oliver Wakeman also joined the band on keyboards.\n\nThe band recorded Fly From Here in 2011, their first new album in 10 years, with David on vocals and Trevor Horn as producer.  Before the album was completed, Wakeman was replaced by Geoff Downes, bringing together the Drama lineup and a similar sound.  The title track was originally conceived in 1981, and it was refined and extended into 20-minute six-part epic.\n\nIn February 2012, after contracting a respiratory illness, David was replaced by Glass Hammer vocalist Jon Davison who, like David, was discovered while fronting a Yes cover band.  In 2014, Yes released Heaven & Earth with Davison performing vocals.\n\nOn May 19, 2015,  Chris Squire announced that he would be unable to join the band on their North American tour with Toto due to being diagnosed with Acute Erythroid Leukemia (AEL), an uncommon form of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Billy Sherwood would perform with the band in his place.\n\nOn June 28, 2015, Yes released the following announcement:\n\nIt’s with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire. Chris peacefully passed away last night (27 June 2015) in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThis is the page for the British progressive rock band Yes.

            "content": "90125 is the eleventh album by progressive rock group Yes, released in 1983. It was the first album since the breakup of Yes in 1981. It is also the first album to feature Trevor Rabin, and also features the return of vocalist Jon Anderson, who quit the band in 1979. It also marked the first time in twelve years that original keyboardist Tony Kaye had appeared with the group. The album is notable for marking a radical shift in style, with Yes largely trading in their trademark symphonic progressive rock sound for contemporary, synthesized 1980's pop.\n\nThe title of the album refers to its original catalogue number, not an American ZIP code (which is not in use).\n\n\n\nBackground\nThis new incarnation of Yes came about almost by accident. In 1980, well-known members Jon Anderson (vocalist) and Rick Wakeman (keyboardist) had left the band, replaced by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes respectively. The new line-up was short-lived: after an album (Drama) and tour, they disbanded at the beginning of 1981. Bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White continued to work together, including on the abortive XYZ project and releasing a single as a duo in 1981.\n\nGuitarist Trevor Rabin had left his native South Africa in the late 1970s and had released a series of solo albums. There had been various attempts to place Rabin in a band, including a proposed quartet with Rick Wakeman, John Wetton and Carl Palmer in 1980 and a proposed trio with Keith Emerson and Jack Bruce. Rabin tried out in Asia, alongside Wetton, Palmer and former Yes members Steve Howe and Geoff Downes. However, he had also been put in touch with Squire and White and this was to be his path instead.\n\nSquire, White and Rabin began working together, initially considering some of the XYZ material. Trevor Horn was also associated with the nascent band from an early stage as the band's producer and, at one point, it was considered having him as the lead vocalist.\n\nThe band needed a keyboard player. Eddie Jobson was approached, but rejected the post. Instead, the trio were joined by none other than original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye, who had been fired in 1971. They christened themselves \"Cinema\" and began recording what they thought was their debut album, comprising mainly of original music Rabin had originally earmarked for a solo album, and produced by Horn.\n\nEverything changed in the spring of 1983 when Jon Anderson was played some of Cinema's recordings by Squire. When Anderson professed interest and became keen to join, it was realized that Yes, essentially, were reforming. Rabin was dubious at first, not wanting to be perceived as Steve Howe's replacement, but rather the lead guitarist for a new group. However, he quickly changed his mind once Anderson brought in some new lyrics and put his distinctive vocals on the existing music tracks. Thus, after a three-year gap, Yes was back.\n\nHowever, due to a falling out with album producer Horn, Kaye left the sessions during the recording of 90125, with much of the keyboard work on the album being played by Rabin or Horn's hand-picked production team. When the band started preparing for a tour to support the album, Eddie Jobson was again asked to join, which he accepted. Jobson appeared in the video for the first single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". In order to consolidate the legal position that this band was YES, Kaye was brought back. Jobson, unwilling to share the role of keyboard player, dropped out.\n\n\nRelease\nReleased that Autumn on Atlantic Records' subsidiary, Atco, 90125 launched Yes to the MTV age and to a whole new breed of fans. The music was catchy, contemporary and well-liked by reviewers and their new fans (many of whom had little clue of the band's previous incarnation). The lead single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart,\" became the band's first (and only) US #1 hit, driving 90125 to the Top 5 and helping it sell three million units, by far Yes's most successful album. The British sales were not as spectacular, but still solid, and successive hits, such as \"Leave It\" and \"It Can Happen\" ensured 90125 had a lengthy chart life. In addition, \"Cinema\" won the 1984 Grammy for the best rock instrumental, despite having no easily-discernible time signature.\n\nThe album's logo was created and designed by Garry Mouat at Assorted Images on an Apple IIe computer, which would be used on Yes's next studio album Big Generator as well. 90125 (Atco 790 125) reached #16 in the UK. It also reached #5 in the US during a chart stay of 53 weeks.\n\nRecently in 2005, a Max Graham remix of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" reached #9 in the UK singles charts, bettering the original's #28 peak.\n\n\n Contribution of Producer Trevor Horn\nThe album's great success was owed in no small part to the skills of its producer Trevor Horn, effectively the sixth member of the band during the making of the album; he is also credited with some of the songwriting. Horn was vocalist on Yes's previous album Drama (1980), but subsequently left to pursue full-time production work. Often lauded in the early 1980s for using the recording studio as an instrument in itself, he gave 90125 a clarity and sheen that made it very distinctive for the era. He skillfully exploited the then-new technology of digital sampling to achieve not only dazzling orchestral and vocal effects (witness the tracks Owner of a Lonely Heart, Leave It and City of Love), but also prominent usage of textural sounds which up until then were generally foreign to rock music. For example, to add interest, atmosphere or depth to the mix, Horn would mix in unexpected audio segments, such as the introduction to City of Love, which uses a sample from the opening of the 1924 orchestral piece Fountains of Rome by Italian composer Ottorino Respighi, faded in beneath a two-note bass guitar riff. (This in itself subtly reveals that the City of Love is Rome). And history repeated itself... a testament to Horn's pioneering achievement here is that snippets from Horn's own production (particularly complex vocal harmonies) were themselves later used as raw musical material by several high-profile artists, such as US jazzman Herbie Hancock and UK dance act Orbital.\n\n\nRemix albums\nYes released an album on the Atlantic label (ATCO Records) in 1984 called \"Twelve Inches on Tape\" (released on album as well, title unavailable). This (now) rarity offered listeners 4 remixes of their chart-topping singles of \"Leave It\" and \"Owner Of A Lonely Heart.\" The track listing from \"Twelve inches on tape\" (4 \"mixes\" in total):\n\n\"Leave It\" (Remix) (Chris Squire/Trevor Rabin/Trevor Horn) \nProduced by Trevor Horn.

      "wiki_content": "90125 is the eleventh album by progressive rock group Yes, released in 1983. It was the first album since the breakup of Yes in 1981. It is also the first album to feature Trevor Rabin, and also features the return of vocalist Jon Anderson, who quit the band in 1979. It also marked the first time in twelve years that original keyboardist Tony Kaye had appeared with the group. The album is notable for marking a radical shift in style, with Yes largely trading in their trademark symphonic progressive rock sound for contemporary, synthesized 1980's pop.\n\nThe title of the album refers to its original catalogue number, not an American ZIP code (which is not in use).\n\n\n\nBackground\nThis new incarnation of Yes came about almost by accident. In 1980, well-known members Jon Anderson (vocalist) and Rick Wakeman (keyboardist) had left the band, replaced by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes respectively. The new line-up was short-lived: after an album (Drama) and tour, they disbanded at the beginning of 1981. Bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White continued to work together, including on the abortive XYZ project and releasing a single as a duo in 1981.\n\nGuitarist Trevor Rabin had left his native South Africa in the late 1970s and had released a series of solo albums. There had been various attempts to place Rabin in a band, including a proposed quartet with Rick Wakeman, John Wetton and Carl Palmer in 1980 and a proposed trio with Keith Emerson and Jack Bruce. Rabin tried out in Asia, alongside Wetton, Palmer and former Yes members Steve Howe and Geoff Downes. However, he had also been put in touch with Squire and White and this was to be his path instead.\n\nSquire, White and Rabin began working together, initially considering some of the XYZ material. Trevor Horn was also associated with the nascent band from an early stage as the band's producer and, at one point, it was considered having him as the lead vocalist.\n\nThe band needed a keyboard player. Eddie Jobson was approached, but rejected the post. Instead, the trio were joined by none other than original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye, who had been fired in 1971. They christened themselves \"Cinema\" and began recording what they thought was their debut album, comprising mainly of original music Rabin had originally earmarked for a solo album, and produced by Horn.\n\nEverything changed in the spring of 1983 when Jon Anderson was played some of Cinema's recordings by Squire. When Anderson professed interest and became keen to join, it was realized that Yes, essentially, were reforming. Rabin was dubious at first, not wanting to be perceived as Steve Howe's replacement, but rather the lead guitarist for a new group. However, he quickly changed his mind once Anderson brought in some new lyrics and put his distinctive vocals on the existing music tracks. Thus, after a three-year gap, Yes was back.\n\nHowever, due to a falling out with album producer Horn, Kaye left the sessions during the recording of 90125, with much of the keyboard work on the album being played by Rabin or Horn's hand-picked production team. When the band started preparing for a tour to support the album, Eddie Jobson was again asked to join, which he accepted. Jobson appeared in the video for the first single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". In order to consolidate the legal position that this band was YES, Kaye was brought back. Jobson, unwilling to share the role of keyboard player, dropped out.\n\n\nRelease\nReleased that Autumn on Atlantic Records' subsidiary, Atco, 90125 launched Yes to the MTV age and to a whole new breed of fans. The music was catchy, contemporary and well-liked by reviewers and their new fans (many of whom had little clue of the band's previous incarnation). The lead single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart,\" became the band's first (and only) US #1 hit, driving 90125 to the Top 5 and helping it sell three million units, by far Yes's most successful album. The British sales were not as spectacular, but still solid, and successive hits, such as \"Leave It\" and \"It Can Happen\" ensured 90125 had a lengthy chart life. In addition, \"Cinema\" won the 1984 Grammy for the best rock instrumental, despite having no easily-discernible time signature.\n\nThe album's logo was created and designed by Garry Mouat at Assorted Images on an Apple IIe computer, which would be used on Yes's next studio album Big Generator as well. 90125 (Atco 790 125) reached #16 in the UK. It also reached #5 in the US during a chart stay of 53 weeks.\n\nRecently in 2005, a Max Graham remix of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" reached #9 in the UK singles charts, bettering the original's #28 peak.\n\n\n Contribution of Producer Trevor Horn\nThe album's great success was owed in no small part to the skills of its producer Trevor Horn, effectively the sixth member of the band during the making of the album; he is also credited with some of the songwriting. Horn was vocalist on Yes's previous album Drama (1980), but subsequently left to pursue full-time production work. Often lauded in the early 1980s for using the recording studio as an instrument in itself, he gave 90125 a clarity and sheen that made it very distinctive for the era. He skillfully exploited the then-new technology of digital sampling to achieve not only dazzling orchestral and vocal effects (witness the tracks Owner of a Lonely Heart, Leave It and City of Love), but also prominent usage of textural sounds which up until then were generally foreign to rock music. For example, to add interest, atmosphere or depth to the mix, Horn would mix in unexpected audio segments, such as the introduction to City of Love, which uses a sample from the opening of the 1924 orchestral piece Fountains of Rome by Italian composer Ottorino Respighi, faded in beneath a two-note bass guitar riff. (This in itself subtly reveals that the City of Love is Rome). And history repeated itself... a testament to Horn's pioneering achievement here is that snippets from Horn's own production (particularly complex vocal harmonies) were themselves later used as raw musical material by several high-profile artists, such as US jazzman Herbie Hancock and UK dance act Orbital.\n\n\nRemix albums\nYes released an album on the Atlantic label (ATCO Records) in 1984 called \"Twelve Inches on Tape\" (released on album as well, title unavailable).
