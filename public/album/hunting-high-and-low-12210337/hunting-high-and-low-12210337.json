      "biography": "a-ha is a Norwegian synthpop band. The trio, composed of lead vocalist Morten Harket, guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, formed in 1982 and left Oslo, Norway for London in order to make a career in the music business. \n\nThe origin of the name a-ha comes from the lyric of an early song. After checking dictionaries in several languages, they found out that 'a-ha' was an international way of expressing recognition, with positive connotations. It was short, a-ha was easy to say and somewhat unusual.\n\n\"Take on Me\" was the first song Morten Harket heard Magne Furuholmen and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy created. At that time the song was called \"Lesson One.\" After multiple re-recordings and two failed releases, \"Take on Me\" became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1985. Although their first release of the song in 1984 was not a major success, it was remixed by producer Alan Tarney a year later, and sold 1.5 million copies worldwide in one week. Eventually the single \"Take on Me\" is estimated to have sold 7-9 million copies worldwide; it peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number two in the UK Singles Chart. Sales were aided in the U.S. by a music video on MTV that mimicked the truck chase from Terry Gilliam's movie Brazil and the climactic scene from the Ken Russell film Altered States. The video used a sketchy animation / live action combination called \"Rotoscoping\" that tells a fantasy thriller story to the song. At the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards \"Take on Me\" won in six categories. It was also nominated for Best Video of the Year at 1986 American Music Awards.  As of February 2020, the official video has surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube.\n\nThe follow-up single to \"Take on Me\" was \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\". In the U.S., the song peaked at number twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number seventeen on Radio & Records airplay chart. In addition, the music video for the song won in two categories at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards. \n\na-ha's American success culminated in their 1986 Grammy nomination in a coveted Best New Artist category which was eventually won by Sade.\n\n\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" turned out to be A-ha's last Billboard Top 40 single, and to this day in the United States a-ha is mostly remembered by the general public only because of the singularly huge success of \"Take on Me\". Hunting High and Low (1985), which contained \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" and \"Take on Me,\" was a worldwide bestseller. In the U.S., it sold more than a million copies and acquired platinum certification by RIAA. As of 2005, Hunting High and Low has sold 8 million copies worldwide.\n\na-ha's second album was Scoundrel Days (1986) and represented a move towards alternative rock as synthpop began to fall out of style. In 1987, they provided the title song for the James Bond film The Living Daylights. Stay on These Roads (1988) received more mixed reviews than the previous albums. In spite of a drastic decline in sales in the next few years, a-ha continued to record two more albums, East of the Sun, West of the Moon (1990) and Memorial Beach (1993). East of the Sun, West of the Moon featured a cover version of The Everly Brothers 1963 single, \"Crying in the Rain\".\n\nBecause of apparent internal conflicts between the band members and conflict with the record label at the time, A-ha split in 1994 and their members started focusing on solo activities, but came together in 1994 to perform for the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. This performance included their song composed for the Winter Paralympics, \"Shapes That Go Together\".\n\nAfter a very well-received performance of \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" and a new song, \"Summer Moved On\", at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, the band returned to the studio and recorded 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, which resulted in a new tour, and a videocast performance of a-ha (with Briskeby) opening the new Vallhall stadium in Oslo. Sales of this album and 2002's Lifelines showed that their fanbase was still there, and also that they were able to attract new audiences, especially in Central Europe and Scandinavia, where the albums sold extremely well. They appeared again at the Nobel Peace Prize concert in 2001. a-ha's music video for the song, \"I Wish I Cared\" was the first fully web-based animated flash music video to be made available.\n\nA live album (from their 2002 tour) with the title How Can I Sleep With Your Voice in My Head? was released in March of 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 classic \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\".\n\nIn 2004, an in-depth book entitled \"The Swing Of Things\" was published, also featuring a CD of early demo material. In 2004, a-ha celebrated their twentieth anniversary with the release of a new singles collection: The Definitive Singles Collection 1984-2004. This compilation brought them back into the UK Top 20 Album Charts, where they reached number thirteen. Over their career, a-ha have officially released 32 singles. 13 of these became top ten singles in the UK, and 14 singles have been number one on the radio lists over the world. The compilation included some of the highlights from a-haâ€™s last 20 years.\n\nIn September, a-ha returned to the U.S. (at Irving Plaza in New York City) for the band's first concert on American soil since 1986. A short impromptu performance of \"Take on Me\" occurred on September 11 in Times Square. On August 27, 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in Frognerparken in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway.\n\nOn November 4, 2005, the band released its new studio album, Analogue. The first single \"Celice\" was released on October 4 in mainland Europe. Later that same month, a tour followed, with concerts in Brussels, France, Germany and the UK. The release of the track, \"Analogue (All I Want)\" followed in the UK in January 2006, giving a-ha its first top ten hit in the UK since 1988. The third single in Europe (second in the UK) from the album was the Magne Furuholmen penned \"Cosy Prisons\", already a live-staple in the band's set.\n\nOn the 30 October 2006 in London a-ha received the prestigious Q Inspiration Award for its long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business.\n\nIn 2007 a-ha recorded a cover of John Lennon's \"#9 Dream\" for Amnesty International.\n\nA ninth studio album, Foot Of The Mountain, was released in the summer of 2009. This more synth oriented album got a number five position in the UK in August 2009, and was No. 11 on the European album charts.\n\n\"Norway's most successful band through the years is splitting up for good!\nAfter 9 studio albums with over 35 million albums sold, it`s over for the band.\"\n\nA-ha had a press conference in Cologne 26.10.09, the day before their last world tour kick-off in Lanxess Arena. The last concert was in Oslo Norway. The concert ion 4 December 2010 at the Oslo Spektrum. \n\nOn March 21, 2015, it was confirmed in national Norwegian newspapers that a-ha has reunited.  Their tenth studio album, Cast in Steel, was released in 2015. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/a-ha\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "Hunting High and Low is the debut album of the Norwegian New wave band a-ha. Released 1 June 1985 through Warner Bros. Records, the album was a huge commercial success selling more than 10 million units worldwide, peaking at #15 in the United States Billboard 200 and reaching high positions on charts worldwide. The album was recorded at Rendezvous Studios in London, produced by Tony Mansfield, John Ratcliff and Alan Tarney.\n\nIn all, five singles from the album were released, though not all were released internationally: Take on Me, Love Is Reason, The Sun Always Shines on T.V., Train of Thought and Hunting High and Low. The group was nominated for best new artist at the Grammy Awards in 1986, making a-ha the first Norwegian band to be nominated for a Grammy.\n\nTake on Me was the first single released by the band. An early version was recorded and released in late 1984 with an early music video. The song became a #3 hit in a-ha's native Norway but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The band went back into the studio to re-record the song for the Hunting High and Low album, but a second UK release in early 1985 was again ignored. Before releasing their single in the United States, the band undertook the production of a new music video for the song, working with director Steve Barron. Barron had previously created hit videos for Toto, Thomas Dolby, Culture Club and Michael Jackson, but the a-ha video was unlike any of his earlier work. A plot-driven amalgamation of live-action  and rotoscope-style animation  by husband-and-wife team Michael Patterson and Candace Reckinger, it drew inspiration from Patterson's animated film Commuter and the film Altered States. The innovative video for \"Take on Me\" was first broadcast on local Boston music video station V-66, and soon after given heavy rotation on MTV.\n\nThe single debuted in Billboard the week of July 13, 1985, and was heading into the U.S. top twenty when it was given an international release, including a second release in Norway and a third shot at the UK market. It hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, spending 27 weeks on the charts and becoming the tenth-biggest single of 1985, and this time going to number two in the United Kingdom and number one in Norway. In all, the song reached number one in 36 countries, becoming one of the world's best-selling singles of all time with nearly 9 million copies sold.\n\nThe second single for most of the world was The Sun Always Shines on TV (Love is Reason had failed to hit the Norwegian Top 40 earlier in the year), and the band followed its massively successful music video with another critically acclaimed clip for the song. Starting off as a sequel of sorts, Morten Harket breaks away from his happy ending to join his band in performance amidst mannequins at a rural church, Saint Albans in Teddington, which has since become an art gallery. \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" improved upon the first single's success in the United Kingdom, hitting number one and remaining there for two weeks in January 1986. It was a top-10 hit nearly everywhere it was released except in the United States, where it peaked at #20 and would be the band's last major hit to date in that country. The single sold 5 million copies around the world. The track was remixed as a dance version, which was a top-5 hit on the U.S. Dance chart, and B-side to the single and remix was the otherwise unreleased Driftwood.\n\nTrain of Thought saw limited release as the third single in Europe. It was not released as a 7\" in the United States but received rock radio play and a set of remixes again made the dance charts. Waaktaar based the lyrics for this song on existentialist authors and poets Gunvor Hofmo, Knut Hamsun and Fyodor Dostoevsky, his favourites at the time. It was a-ha's third consecutive Top 10 single in the United Kingdom and Ireland, reaching #8 and #5 respectively, and charting well in Germany and Sweden. World sales hit 500,000 copies.\n\nThe last single from the album was Hunting High and Low, released in June 1986. The single saw its highest chartings in France, where it peaked at number four, and the United Kingdom, where it was number five. The single was released in the United States but did not make the Hot 100. An extended version was available on 12\" vinyl, but the midtempo track did not see dance chart success.\n\nColdplay, a band influenced by a-ha, has been known to perform Hunting High and Low in concert.\n\nThe \"Take on Me\" video was nominated for eight 1986 MTV Video Music Awards, and at the third annual ceremony September 5, 1986, the video won six awards, including Best New Artist and Viewer's Choice. \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" was nominated for an additional three awards, winning two, for a total of eight wins. Even as the total number of categories has nearly doubled, only one other artist to date has won as many MTV Awards in a single year. Peter Gabriel won nine the following year for \"Sledgehammer\" and \"Big Time,\" two videos which progressed further down the roads a-ha ventured in groundbreaking use of animation in music video.\n\nIn 2002, \"Take on Me\" was ranked at number eight on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders, although this status is slightly misleading as it reflects a-ha's lack of mainstream success in the United States; the group was by no means a one-hit wonder elsewhere or in career terms. In 2006, \"Take on Me\" was ranked number 24 on VH1's Greatest Songs of the 1980s.\n\nThe band released a live version of The Sun Always Shines on TV in 2003.\n\nHunting High and Low was a-ha's breakout album. Upon its release in May 1985, Hunting High and Low peaked at number 15 on the Billboard's Top 200 album chart. The album granted a-ha international recognition. Hunting High and Low got 3x platinum status in the UK and Platinum status in the United States and Germany, and Gold status in Brasil, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe album peaked at 15 in the U.S., according to Billboard music charts and has sold about 1.8 million copies in the U.S. It peaked at 2 on the UK charts, and hit 1 in Norway. The album has been certified platinum in the United States and 3x platinum in UK.\n\nBeginning with the single Take on Me, a-ha's debut album sold more than eight million copies worldwide and spawned two number one hits. In the fall of 1986, \"Take on Me\" and \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" were nominated for 11 MTV Video Awards combined, and a-ha won eight of these.\n\nTim DiGravina of AllMusic Guide said \"It's a cohesive album with smart pace changeups, and it rarely fails to delight or satisfy a listener's need for a synth pop fix... One can't escape the feeling that Hunting High and Low is a product of the 1980s, but with highs like 'Take on Me' and 'The Sun Always Shines on TV,' and no lows in sight, a-ha's debut is a treat worth relishing.\"\n\nThe album has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.\n\nIn June 1986, a-ha  began a world tour which went through August 1987. The band had never played a single concert when \"Take on Me\" shot to #1 in America; soon it could boast a 16-country, 113-city tour under its belt along with countless interviews and television appearances. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/a-ha/Hunting+High+and+Low\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
