      "biography": "Depeche Mode are an English electronic music band formed in 1980 in Basildon, Essex. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter 1980-81). Vince Clarke left the band after the release of their 1981 debut album, Speak & Spell, and was replaced by Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) with Gore taking over songwriting. Wilder left the band in 1995; Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher have since continued as a trio.\nDepeche Mode's origins date back to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a The Cure-influenced band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. Fletcher would later recall, \"Why am I in the band? It was accidental right from the beginning. I was actually forced to be in the band. I played the guitar and I had a bass; it was a question of them roping me in.\" In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an \"Ultravox rip-off band\", The Plan, with friends Robert Marlow and Paul Langwith. In 1978–79, Martin Gore played guitar in an acoustic duo, Norman and The Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals. In 1979, Marlow, Gore, and friend Paul Redmond formed a band called The French Look, with Marlow on vocals/keyboards, Gore on guitar and Redmond on keyboards. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass.\nSoon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesisers, working odd jobs in order to buy or borrow the instruments from friends. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", and Depeche Mode were born. When explaining the choice for the new name taken from a French fashion magazine, Dépêche mode (from French dépêche that means here \"dispatch\" - from Old French despesche/despeche - or \"news report\" and mode that means \"fashion\"), Martin Gore said, \"It means hurried fashion or fashion dispatch. I like the sound of that.\" Gore recollects that the first time the band played as Depeche Mode was a school gig in May 1980. The band made their recording debut in 1980 on the Some Bizzare Album with the song \"Photographic\", which was later re-recorded for their debut album Speak & Spell.\nThe band made a demo tape but, instead of mailing the tape to record companies, they would go in and personally deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, \"most of them would tell us to **** off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else.\"\nAccording to Gahan, prior to securing their record contract, they were receiving offers from all the major labels. Phonogram offered them \"money you could never have imagined and all sorts of crazy things like clothes allowances\".\nWhile playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, the band were approached by Daniel Miller, an electronic musician and founder of Mute Records, who was interested in their recording a single for his burgeoning label. The result of this verbal contract was their first single, \"Dreaming of Me\", recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981. It reached number 57 in the UK charts. Encouraged by this, the band recorded their second single, \"New Life\", which climbed to number 11 in the UK charts. The next single was \"Just Can't Get Enough\". This relentlessly upbeat piece of synthpop became the band's first UK top ten hit and it remains one of their best known songs. It was also the first Depeche Mode song to get a music video and is the only one of the band's videos to feature Vince Clarke. Depeche Mode's debut album, Speak & Spell, was released in November 1981 and peaked at number ten on the UK album charts. Critical reviews were mixed – Melody Maker described it as a \"great album... one they had to make to conquer fresh audiences and please the fans who just can’t get enough\", while Rolling Stone was more critical, calling the album \"PG-rated fluff\".",

            "content": "A Broken Frame is the second studio album by the British synthpop band Depeche Mode, released in 1982. The album was written entirely by Martin Gore and recorded after the departure of Vince Clarke, who had left the band to form Yazoo with singer Alison Moyet. Alan Wilder was part of a second tour in the United Kingdom occurring prior to the release of this album, but he had not officially joined the band, and thus, does not appear on the album.\n\nIn the documentary that appears on the DVD that came with the 2006 reissue, Gore describes the record as \"our worst album\". None of the singles had long-term success compared to most of Depeche Mode's other albums' singles. A Broken Frame was the only album not represented on 101 and Remixes 81 - 04. Prior to 2006, the last song from the album to be performed live was \"Leave In Silence\" in 1986. \"Leave in Silence\" finally made its return (as an acoustic rendition) in a 2006 concert in Paris.\n\nThe song \"Monument\" was covered by GusGus for the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses.\n\nA special limited edition live album based on A Broken Frame recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on the 25th October 1982 was also released early in 1983 which also included a special 12\" version of Get The Balance Right on the B-Side.\n\n\n \n2006 re-release\nIn 2006, A Broken Frame was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the three B-sides \"Now This is Fun\", \"Oberkorn (It's a Small Town)\", and \"Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" in addition to several live versions of some of the songs from A Broken Frame.\n\nThe re-release preserves the album as it was originally intended. The bonus track \"Further Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" was removed (but unlike earlier re-releases wasn't put on the DVD as an extra) and the version of \"Leave In Silence\" is the album version, not the \"Longer\" version, making its debut in the USA. (Like \"Further Excerpts\", the \"Longer\" version doesn't appear on the DVD)\n\nThere are some omissions with the re-release, including a chord at the beginning of the stereo mixes of \"Satellite\" has disappeared and there are live versions of \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" and \"The Sun & The Rainfall\" listed on the DVD artwork that are not present on the disc itself.\n\nAlso included was a 27-minute documentary on A Broken Frame called Depeche Mode 1982 (The Beginning Of Their So-called Dark Phase) featuring interviews with Depeche Mode (including Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder) and other personnel such as Daniel Miller and cover-photographer Brian Griffin. There is also footage of television appearances and live performances.\n\nThe remastered album was released on \"deluxe\" vinyl in March 2007 in Germany, and internationally in April 2007.\n\n Track listing\n1982 release: Mute / Stumm 9 (UK)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun and the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \n 1982 release: Sire / 23751 (U.S.)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 6:28 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" – 4:20 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun & the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \nAll compositions by Martin Gore. \nDavid Gahan sings lead vocals on all songs except \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" which is a duet with Gore. \"Nothing to Fear\" and \"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" are instrumental. \n 2006 re-release\nMute: DM CD 2 (CD/SACD + DVD) / CDX STUMM 9 (CD/SACD)\n\nDisc 1 is a hybrid SACD/CD with a multi-channel SACD layer. \nDisc 2 is a DVD which includes A Broken Frame in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo plus bonus material \n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:43 (contains a slight edit, or error, at the beginning of the track on the redbook and stereo SACD layers.

None of the singles had long-term success compared to most of Depeche Mode's other albums' singles. A Broken Frame was the only album not represented on 101 and Remixes 81 - 04. Prior to 2006, the last song from the album to be performed live was \"Leave In Silence\" in 1986. \"Leave in Silence\" finally made its return (as an acoustic rendition) in a 2006 concert in Paris.\n\nThe song \"Monument\" was covered by GusGus for the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses.\n\nA special limited edition live album based on A Broken Frame recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on the 25th October 1982 was also released early in 1983 which also included a special 12\" version of Get The Balance Right on the B-Side.\n\n\n \n2006 re-release\nIn 2006, A Broken Frame was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the three B-sides \"Now This is Fun\", \"Oberkorn (It's a Small Town)\", and \"Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" in addition to several live versions of some of the songs from A Broken Frame.\n\nThe re-release preserves the album as it was originally intended. The bonus track \"Further Excerpts from: My Secret Garden\" was removed (but unlike earlier re-releases wasn't put on the DVD as an extra) and the version of \"Leave In Silence\" is the album version, not the \"Longer\" version, making its debut in the USA. (Like \"Further Excerpts\", the \"Longer\" version doesn't appear on the DVD)\n\nThere are some omissions with the re-release, including a chord at the beginning of the stereo mixes of \"Satellite\" has disappeared and there are live versions of \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" and \"The Sun & The Rainfall\" listed on the DVD artwork that are not present on the disc itself.\n\nAlso included was a 27-minute documentary on A Broken Frame called Depeche Mode 1982 (The Beginning Of Their So-called Dark Phase) featuring interviews with Depeche Mode (including Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder) and other personnel such as Daniel Miller and cover-photographer Brian Griffin. There is also footage of television appearances and live performances.\n\nThe remastered album was released on \"deluxe\" vinyl in March 2007 in Germany, and internationally in April 2007.\n\n Track listing\n1982 release: Mute / Stumm 9 (UK)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun and the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \n 1982 release: Sire / 23751 (U.S.)\n\"Leave in Silence\" – 6:28 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:44 \n\"The Meaning of Love\" – 3:06 \n\"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" – 4:20 \n\"A Photograph of You\" – 3:04 \n\"Shouldn't Have Done That\" – 3:12 \n\"The Sun & the Rainfall\" – 5:02 \nAll compositions by Martin Gore. \nDavid Gahan sings lead vocals on all songs except \"Shouldn't Have Done That\" which is a duet with Gore. \"Nothing to Fear\" and \"Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden\" are instrumental. \n 2006 re-release\nMute: DM CD 2 (CD/SACD + DVD) / CDX STUMM 9 (CD/SACD)\n\nDisc 1 is a hybrid SACD/CD with a multi-channel SACD layer. \nDisc 2 is a DVD which includes A Broken Frame in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo plus bonus material \n\"Leave in Silence\" – 4:51 \n\"My Secret Garden\" – 4:46 \n\"Monument\" – 3:15 \n\"Nothing to Fear\" – 4:18 \n\"See You\" – 4:34 \n\"Satellite\" – 4:43 (contains a slight edit, or error, at the beginning of the track on the redbook and stereo SACD layers.
