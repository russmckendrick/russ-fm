      "biography": "Massive Attack are a British DJ and trip hop duo from Bristol, England consisting of Robert \"3D\" Del Naja and Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall. Working with co-producers, as well as various session musicians and guest vocalists, they make records and tour live. The duo are considered to be progenitors of the trip hop genre. Their debut album, Blue Lines was released in 1991, with the single \"Unfinished Sympathy\" reaching the charts and later being voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by The Guardian.\nDJs Daddy G and Andrew Vowles and graffiti artist-turned-rapper Robert Del Naja met as members of partying collective The Wild Bunch. One of the first homegrown soundsystems in the UK, The Wild Bunch became dominant on the Bristol club scene in the mid-1980s.\nMassive Attack started as a spin-off production trio in 1988, with the independently-released song, \"Any Love\", sung by falsetto-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy, and then, with considerable backing from Neneh Cherry, they signed to Circa Records in 1990 - committing to deliver six studio albums and a \"best of\" compilation. Circa became a subsidiary of, and was later subsumed into, Virgin Records, which in turn was acquired by EMI. Blue Lines (1991), was co-produced by Jonny Dollar and Cameron McVey, who also became their first manager. Geoff Barrow, who went on to form Portishead, was an intern and trainee tape operator at Bristol's Coach House studio when the album was recorded. McVey (credited at the time as 'Booga Bear') and his wife, Neneh Cherry provided crucial financial support and in-kind assistance to the early careers of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky during this period, even paying regular wages to them through their Cherry Bear Organisation. Massive Attack went on to critical acclaim for their ever-changing line-up of distinctive, often 'ethereal' or whispery guest vocalists, interspersed with Del Naja and Marshall's (initially Tricky's) own, similarly hushed, sprechgesang stylings, on top of what became regarded as an essentially British creative sampling production; a trademark sound that fused down-tempo hip hop, soul, reggae and other eclectic references, musical and lyrical. With Protection in 1994, Mezzanine in 1998, and then Robert Del Naja's essentially solo 100th Window in 2003, Massive's overall sound grew persistently more experimental and melancholic, having a greater degree of post-punk texture and moodily cinematic electronica integrated within..\nIn the nineties, the trio became known for often not being able to easily get along with one another and working increasingly separately. Andy Vowles (Mushroom), who had once thought of himself as the trio's musical director, reluctantly and acrimoniously left Massive Attack permanently in late 1999, after an ultimatum from the other two members to end the group immediately if he did not. Despite having taken Del Naja's side in the effective firing of Mushroom and then participating in a show-of-unity webcast as a duo the following year, Grant Marshall (G) had also effectively left by 2001 in that he abandoned the studio altogether. Marshall's departure was often ostensibly portrayed as merely a fatherhood sabbatical, perhaps to play down tensions. G returned to a studio role with greater commitment in 2005, having joined the touring line-up of 2003/4. The two would later work jointly once again during the 2008 Damon Albarn sessions for the fifth proper studio album. The other impetus being the then availability and willingness of Martina Topley-Bird to finally be involved in 2009.\nA record label, Melankolic, was started in 1995 as an imprint of Virgin , but had become defunct by 2003, primarily because the newly appointed Virgin executives at that time stopped further funding due to the label's seemingly unmanageable overspending, or rather that of its bands. Over the decades, the group have collaborated with Neneh Cherry, Madonna, David Bowie, Mos Def, Elizabeth Fraser and Sinéad O'Connor amongst many others. Despite the group's many associations with Bristol, Carlton McCarthy, their first ever featured artist, is the only Bristolian-born and raised guest singer that they have ever featured on a record to date. Roots reggae veteran Horace Andy has featured on all of their regular studio albums, each one being slower to emerge than the last; notoriously taking an increasingly long number of years to be concertedly started and finished. The most recent studio album is entitled Heligoland.",

      "editorial_notes": "Trip-hop was plenty bleak to begin with, but Massive Attack's third album reached new extremes of desolation. The beetle on the cover is a good indicator of the menace inside. Tempos crawl. Vocals are pitched between a whisper and a growl. Even the milk is black in their midnight world. Hip-hop beats and dub bass come cloaked in paranoid atmospheres, but the all-encompassing sense of dread is never anything less than electrifying. On \"Teardrop\", featuring Cocteau Twins' angelic Elizabeth Fraser, the storm clouds briefly part—a reprieve that only accentuates the heaviness of the rest.",

          "standard": "Trip-hop was plenty bleak to begin with, but Massive Attack's third album reached new extremes of desolation. The beetle on the cover is a good indicator of the menace inside. Tempos crawl. Vocals are pitched between a whisper and a growl. Even the milk is black in their midnight world. Hip-hop beats and dub bass come cloaked in paranoid atmospheres, but the all-encompassing sense of dread is never anything less than electrifying. On \"Teardrop\", featuring Cocteau Twins' angelic Elizabeth Fraser, the storm clouds briefly part—a reprieve that only accentuates the heaviness of the rest."

            "content": "Mezzanine is the third studio album by English electronic music group Massive Attack, released on 20 April 1998 by Circa and Virgin Records. Produced by Massive Attack and Neil Davidge, it saw the duo expanding their trip hop sound to electronica stylings, with diverse influences from new wave, rock, hip hop, and dub music.\n\nMezzanine topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, becoming the group's most commercially successful album to date. It spawned four singles: Risingson, Teardrop, Angel, and Inertia Creeps.\n\nBackground\nThe production of Mezzanine was a stressful process. With tensions arising within the group, it almost split the band. They disagreed about the musical direction for the new material. Robert Del Naja first started making samples from new wave records, from the likes of Wire and Gang of Four: it was the music he'd listened to in his early teens. Del Naja wanted Massive Attack to make an album having an atmosphere of edginess and paranoia present in the music of the late 1970s. Grant Marshall, also a new wave fan himself, supported this idea, as he wanted to get away from the \"urban soul\" of their previous work, Protection, but Andrew Vowles was sceptical. The sessions continued with Vowles and Marshall working on bass and drum loops, while Del Naja carried on experimenting from new wave records. However, during the recording, the group decided to release a new track, Superpredators sampling extensively a Siouxsie and the Banshees' song called Metal Postcard, for the movie soundtrack of The Jackal; the track would be included on the Japanese version of Mezzanine.\n\nThe album was initially meant to be released in December 1997, but was delayed by four months, with Del Naja spending most of the time in the studio \"making tracks, tearing them apart, fucking  them up, panicking, then starting again.\" The album's working title was Damaged Goods, which was the name of the Gang of Four's 1978 debut single.\n\nComposition\nMezzanine has been described as featuring trip hop and electronica, with a \"dark claustrophobia\" coupled with a melancholy. Musically, the album is a major departure from the jazzy and laidback sound of the first two albums, Blue Lines and Protection, invoking the dark undercurrents which had always been present in the collective's music. The album's textured and deep tone relies heavily on abstract and ambient sounds, as demonstrated in the song Angel among others.\n\nSimilar to their previous albums, several songs use one or more samples, ranging from Isaac Hayes to The Cure. In 1998, Manfred Mann sued Massive Attack for unauthorised use of a sample of the song Tribute from Manfred Mann's Earth Band's eponymous 1972 album, used on Black Milk. The song has subsequently appeared as Black Melt on later releases and at live performances, with the sample removed. Later digital editions of Mezzanine have retained the original song, with Mann being added to the songwriting credits.\n\nMezzanine marked the parting of band member Vowles, due to creative conflicts. Reggae artist Horace Andy also performed several spots on the album.\n\nReception\nMezzanine entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 4 September 1998 and then double platinum on 22 July 2013. However, it failed to share the same success in North America, peaking at number 60 on the Billboard 200 and number 51 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\n\nThe album received significant critical acclaim, which praised the collective's new sound. Rolling Stone's Barney Hoskyns, although praising the album, pointed to its flaws: \"Sometimes rhythm and texture are explored at the expense of memorable tunes, and the absence of the bizarre Tricky  only highlights the flat, monotonous rapping of the group's 3-D.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a two-star honorable mention rating and selected Risingson and Man Next Door as highlights.\n\nJohn Bush of AllMusic also had positive words for the album's song Inertia Creeps, saying it could well be the highlight, another feature for just the core threesome. With eerie atmospherics, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen.\"\n\nYears after the album was released, it was placed on several best-of lists in the UK and the United States. In 2000, Q magazine placed Mezzanine at number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 412 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2013, it was placed at 215 on NME's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nAs of 2010, sales in the United States have exceeded 560,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. An instrumental cover version of the song Dissolved Girl was written by composer Ramin Djawadi for Westworld season 3, who previously worked with Neil Davidge for Clash of the Titans 2010 film soundtrack.\n\nMezzanine DNA\nOn the 20th anniversary of Mezzanine's release, the record was encoded into synthetic DNA—a first for an album. The project was in collaboration with TurboBeads Labs in Switzerland; the digital audio of the album was stored in the form of genetic information. The audio was then compressed using Opus, coded in DNA molecules—with 920,000 short DNA strands containing all the data—and then poured into 5,000 tiny glass beads.\n\n20th anniversary reissue\nThe album was remastered and reissued for its 20th anniversary. The 2CD anniversary edition was released on 23 August 2019, and comes with a bonus disc of previously unreleased dub mixes by the Mad Professor, which were originally intended to be released on a Mezzanine remix album. A triple-LP vinyl version was also slated to be released; initially delayed from its proposed release date, the 3LP version was eventually canceled altogether.\n\nIn lieu of the vinyl reissue, the Mad Professor remixes were released as a pink-coloured 12\" vinyl single entitled Massive Attack v Mad Professor Part II (Mezzanine Remix Tapes '98) on 20 September 2019.\n\nThe Mad Professor remixes include Metal Banshee (an unreleased dub version of Superpredators, which was a reworked cover of Metal Postcard originally by Siouxsie and the Banshees), and Wire, a track recorded for the soundtrack to the film Welcome to Sarajevo. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Attack/Mezzanine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
