It consists of:\\n\\nAnneke van Giersbergen (ex-The Gathering) – lead vocals\\nEd Warby (Hail of Bullets, Ayreon, ex-Gorefest) – drums\\nJord Otto (My Propane, ex-ReVamp) – guitars\\nFerry Duijsens – guitars\\nJohan van Stratum (ex-Stream of Passion) – bass\\n\\nThe band originally consisted of ex-Stream of Passion singer Marcela Bovio, but as of April 11, 2017, the band and Marcela parted ways. The band is to play its first show at the Tuska Open Air festival in Helsinki, Finland on 30 June 2017.\\n\\nBelgian band VUUR\\n\\nThe Belgian band VUUR started in early 1999, with ex-members of Outrage, Deconsume, Reller and Hopeman Path. Vuur describes its music as \"chaotic raging manic screaming heavy screamoviolence\".\\nOriginally, Vuur started out as a five-piece with two vocalists: Yannick and Koen. After playing just a few shows, Koen had to set his priorities at home. The band continued as a four-piece with Yannick on the microphone.\\nAfter releasing a scrappy rehearsal-tape recorded on an old tapedeck and playing a bunch of shows, the band managed to get into a decent studio during the winter of 2001. They recorded four songs. Three of these songs appeared on the split-7” with DIY political hardcorepunkband Seein’Red (ned), which the band described as a great experience. The bassplayer Nico released this 7” himself with a pressing of 2000 copies on his label Day One Records. The fourth song appeared on the \\'Decide On Change\\' benefit-LP on Mountain CIA Records from New York (usa). After releasing the split-7” with Seein’Red, they played a bunch of shows.\\nDuring the spring of 2003 the band went into the studio again. They recorded six more songs, of which most were meant for a split-release with Inertie (fra), the great new band of Christophe Mora from Stonehenge Records (another DIY label). Shortly before the release of this record, Inertie split up. Therefore the band decided not to go ahead with doing that record. Eventually, two songs of this second recording session ended up on the split-7” with Amen Ra from Belgium. This 7” was released by Vincent from Amen Ra, had a pressing of only 500 copies and came in three different covers. In 2007 VUUR made some new covers for the last 50 copies of this 7\", since the original covers were all gone.\\nThree more songs from the same session were released on the 4-way-split-CD with Amen Ra (bel), Gantz (fra) and Gameness (fra). The CD was a co-release of 3 labels: Heart On Fire Records, Impure Muzik and Recap Records. The sixth song was a cover of a Born Against-song. It was originally recorded to appear on a Born Against-tribute-LP. This LP did not get released.\\nIn May 2005, the singer Yannick surprised himself and the rest of the band with the message he got from his doctor: no more singing, no more screaming. That was it. For a moment or even for a while, the band was dead. However, someone came up with the idea of asking Koen again. He quit playing in the band several years before. Koen agreed. It was no longer the same band but in some way it was the same band again. But the band had  lost Yannick.\\nThrough Shove Records (ita) and Acclaim Records (jap) VUUR got the fantastic offer to release all our recordings thus far onto 1 CD. Most of these recordings only appeared on vinyl. This discography-CD, called \\'Vuurviolence\\', documents the recordings with Yannick on vocals and appeared in July 2007.\\nIn 2006 the band decided not to do a VUUR-full-7\", but replace it by a split-12\" with Grinding Halt (Holland). Grinding Halt recorded their side of the 12\" in november 2006. VUUR recorded in may 2007. This 12\" has appeared on De Graanrepubliek Records.\\nIn 2008 the band expressed to still have plans, but does not appear to have released further works. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vuur\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band is to play its first show at the Tuska Open Air festival in Helsinki, Finland on 30 June 2017.\\n\\nBelgian band VUUR\\n\\nThe Belgian band VUUR started in early 1999, with ex-members of Outrage, Deconsume, Reller and Hopeman Path. Vuur describes its music as \"chaotic raging manic screaming heavy screamoviolence\".\\nOriginally, Vuur started out as a five-piece with two vocalists: Yannick and Koen. After playing just a few shows, Koen had to set his priorities at home. The band continued as a four-piece with Yannick on the microphone.\\nAfter releasing a scrappy rehearsal-tape recorded on an old tapedeck and playing a bunch of shows, the band managed to get into a decent studio during the winter of 2001. They recorded four songs. Three of these songs appeared on the split-7” with DIY political hardcorepunkband Seein’Red (ned), which the band described as a great experience. The bassplayer Nico released this 7” himself with a pressing of 2000 copies on his label Day One Records. The fourth song appeared on the \\'Decide On Change\\' benefit-LP on Mountain CIA Records from New York (usa). After releasing the split-7” with Seein’Red, they played a bunch of shows.\\nDuring the spring of 2003 the band went into the studio again. They recorded six more songs, of which most were meant for a split-release with Inertie (fra), the great new band of Christophe Mora from Stonehenge Records (another DIY label). Shortly before the release of this record, Inertie split up. Therefore the band decided not to go ahead with doing that record. Eventually, two songs of this second recording session ended up on the split-7” with Amen Ra from Belgium. This 7” was released by Vincent from Amen Ra, had a pressing of only 500 copies and came in three different covers. In 2007 VUUR made some new covers for the last 50 copies of this 7\", since the original covers were all gone.\\nThree more songs from the same session were released on the 4-way-split-CD with Amen Ra (bel), Gantz (fra) and Gameness (fra). The CD was a co-release of 3 labels: Heart On Fire Records, Impure Muzik and Recap Records. The sixth song was a cover of a Born Against-song. It was originally recorded to appear on a Born Against-tribute-LP. This LP did not get released.\\nIn May 2005, the singer Yannick surprised himself and the rest of the band with the message he got from his doctor: no more singing, no more screaming. That was it. For a moment or even for a while, the band was dead. However, someone came up with the idea of asking Koen again. He quit playing in the band several years before. Koen agreed. It was no longer the same band but in some way it was the same band again. But the band had  lost Yannick.\\nThrough Shove Records (ita) and Acclaim Records (jap) VUUR got the fantastic offer to release all our recordings thus far onto 1 CD. Most of these recordings only appeared on vinyl. This discography-CD, called \\'Vuurviolence\\', documents the recordings with Yannick on vocals and appeared in July 2007.\\nIn 2006 the band decided not to do a VUUR-full-7\", but replace it by a split-12\" with Grinding Halt (Holland). Grinding Halt recorded their side of the 12\" in november 2006. VUUR recorded in may 2007. This 12\" has appeared on De Graanrepubliek Records.\\nIn 2008 the band expressed to still have plans, but does not appear to have released further works. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vuur\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
