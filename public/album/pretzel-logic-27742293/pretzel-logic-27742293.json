      "biography": "Steely Dan is an American rock band consisting of core members Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. The band's popularity peaked in the late 1970s, with the release of seven albums blending elements of jazz, rock, funk, R&B, and pop. Rolling Stone has called them \"the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies.\"\nThe band's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies played by Becker and Fagen along with a revolving cast of rock and pop studio musicians. Steely Dan's \"cerebral, wry and eccentric\" lyrics, often filled with sharp sarcasm, touch upon such themes as drugs, love affairs, and crime. The pair is well known for their near-obsessive perfectionism in the recording studio, the most extreme example being that Becker and Fagen used at least 42 different studio musicians, 11 engineers, and took over a year to record the tracks that resulted in 1980's Gaucho - an album that contains only seven songs.\nSteely Dan toured from 1972 to 1974, but in 1975 became a purely studio-based act. The late 1970s saw the group release a series of moderately successful singles and albums. They disbanded in 1981, and throughout most of the next decade Fagen and Becker remained largely inactive in the music world. During this time \"a cult following\" remained devoted to the group. In 1993, the group resumed playing live concerts; later Steely Dan released two albums of new material, the first of which earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. They have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001.",

      "editorial_notes": "Released in 1974, <i>Pretzel Logic</i> marked the pivot point between the touring band Steely Dan had been and the studio-born project they became. The album is a rejection of the 1960s ideal of a rock band as a small group of like-minded people collectively expressing their creativity through their own original material. Instead, Steely Dan embraced what co-founder Donald Fagen later described as the “scrupulous meritocracy” of the big-band era—a time in which bandleaders hired whomever served the song best. Steely Dan adopted that approach, and threw in some characteristic ruthlessness for colour. The result was <i>Pretzel Logic</i>, a succinct sucker-punch of an album that embodied the philosophy Steely Dan had espoused in songs like “Barrytown” or “Through With Buzz”: To hell with feeling—they were embracing the machine.\n\nAnd, boy—does the knife gleam on <i>Pretzel Logic</i>. Even the album’s comforting moments—“Any Major Dude Will Tell You” and the eternal “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number”—are haunted by the sense of something withheld or unsaid. Here were the mysteries of old pulp fiction and detective stories, combined with the fragmented thinking of acid burnouts and conspiracy theorists trying to make sense of an increasingly nonsensical world—or, in Steely Dan’s case, Southern California. That’s where Fagen and his partner Walter Becker had been living while working on <i>Pretzel Logic</i>.“It turned out the sunny clime and prefab cookie-cutter robo-culture in which we now found ourselves only served to heighten our paranoia and alienation,” the duo later wrote. “We had our songs, some nice axes, good girlfriends, brand-new drivers’ licenses, lots of 24-track studio time and a warm place to compose. In other words, Miles was in heaven and all was right in the world.” Steely Dan would get darker (<i>The Royal Scam</i>) and colder, too (<i>Gaucho</i>), but <i>Pretzel Logic</i> strikes the balance between the classic-rock guys your parents and grandparents loved, and the insular creeps who lurked underneath.",
