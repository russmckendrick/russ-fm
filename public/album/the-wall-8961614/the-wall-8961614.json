      "biography": "Pink Floyd were an English rock band that achieved international success with their progressive and psychedelic rock music marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, and elaborate live shows. One of the most commercially successful and influential rock groups in the history of popular music, they have sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States. They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.\nThe band originally consisted of university students Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright, and Syd Barrett. Founded in 1965, they gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s. Under Barrett's creative leadership they released two charting singles, \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play\", and a successful début album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967, several months prior to Barrett's April 1968 departure due to deteriorating mental health. With the loss of Syd, the band moved from psychedelic pop to a more progressive sound, with many tracks written collaboratively while on tour. With this line-up they achieved critical and commercial success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). With Animals and The Wall, Waters became the primary songwriter.\nWright was forced by Waters to leave the group in 1979. Following The Final Cut (1983), the group was temporarily disbanded by Waters. Gilmour and Mason reformed in 1985, and were subsequently rejoined by Wright. They continued to record and tour through 1994, despite Waters' failed 1986 attempt to legally prevent them continuing as Pink Floyd; two more albums followed, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994). After almost two decades of acrimony the band reunited in 2005 for a single performance, at the global awareness event Live 8. Wright died in 2008. Surviving members Gilmour and Mason joined Waters at one of his The Wall Tour shows on 12 May 2011 at the O2 Arena in London; Gilmour performed \"Comfortably Numb\" along with Waters and \"Outside the Wall\" with Mason and Waters.",

      "editorial_notes": "You could say <i>The Wall</i> started taking shape the night Roger Waters leaned over the edge of the stage and spit in a fan’s face. This was July 1977: The band was finishing out their lengthy In the Flesh tour to stadium-size crowds, working at scales unfamiliar and uncomfortable to everyone involved. Risky investments had put them under major financial pressure; audiences seemed more interested in the party than the show; band rapport had gotten so strained that Waters started referring to the rest of the members as “the muffins”.<br />\nAnd so, alone in a crowd of about 80,000 people, standing under the 40-foot-long inflatable pig that had become a central prop of the band’s set, Waters spit. Later that night, he told the producer Bob Ezrin and a psychiatrist friend of Ezrin’s that he sometimes fantasised about building a wall between himself and the audience—an embodiment of how isolated he already felt, and a device by which he could protect what little of himself he thought he had left.<br />\nWhat emerged from that mental image was one of the last, and one of the greatest, gasps of the concept album—that naively romantic idea that music could somehow reach out of the confines of the recorded medium and tell a story that would resonate with the metaphoric heft of a novel. At 80 minutes, <i>The Wall</i> didn’t spare listeners any of Waters’ creative largesse. If anything, it laid bare his inner turmoil (and outer critique) with almost forensic precision: The album traces the long arc of a fictional rock star named Pink Floyd, who evolves from lonely boy to maniacal fascist. Pink starts pointing fingers at everyone from Mom (“Mother”) to the education system (“The Happiest Days of Our Lives”, “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2”) to blacks, gays and Jews (“In the Flesh”) to modern life in general (“The Thin Ice”) before realising that maybe the problem was him all along (“Stop”, “The Trial”)—an arc even more resonant in light of our societal reckoning with the evil men do.<br />\nYeah, it’s a lot, especially as a morality play put on by the rich and famous. But despite their popularity, Pink Floyd were never exactly a friendly band. If anything, <i>The Wall</i> holds up in part because of how profoundly ugly it is, the externalisation of feelings so cruel and noxious that people hate to admit even having them, let alone mining them for art. (In that respect, they had more in common with punk than the punks would probably admit.) What had once felt expansive (take the long song-suites of <i>Animals</i> or <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>) now felt claustrophobic and fragmented, a picture rendered in shrapnel. In nudging Waters towards his most theatrical impulses, producer Ezrin—famous in part for helping create Alice Cooper—gave the album a narrative through line as comforting and familiar as an old myth (the traumatic rise and tragic fall, the superhero rendered human once again), but gave the impression of wholeness where Waters’ collage-like vision didn’t necessarily imply one. At one point, Ezrin suggested that guitarist David Gilmour go to a club to hear the then-new sound of disco. Gilmour hated it, but got the point: Listen to the rigid pacing of “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2” and “Run Like Hell”—this wasn’t music about freedom, but about being martially locked in place. By the time you get to “Comfortably Numb”, a life without feeling doesn’t sound half bad.<br />\nIn addition to elevating them to implausibly greater levels of fame, <i>The Wall</i> marked the last time Waters and the rest of the band would work together in a meaningful way. During the album’s sessions, Waters effectively forced keyboardist Rick Wright out; shortly after 1983’s <i>The Final Cut</i>, Waters quit. In between, they managed to take <i>The Wall</i> on tour. Waters got his wish: During the first half of the show, roadies constructed a wall, brick by cardboard brick, approximately 40 feet in the middle and 130 feet across the top—an embodiment not just of Waters’ concept, but of the band’s general ability to strong-arm reality to suit their dreams. Ezrin, who had run afoul of Waters after unwittingly telling a journalist friend what the conceit of the show was going to be, was forced to buy his own ticket.",

            "content": "The Wall is a rock opera presented as a double album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on November 30, 1979. It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate theatrical effects, and made into a film.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of their previous albums, The Wall is a concept album — specifically, it deals largely with the theme of isolation from one's peers. The concept was largely inspired by the band's 1977 tour promoting the album Animals, with regards to an incident where Roger Waters' frustration with the audience reached a point where Waters spat in the face of a fan who was attempting to climb on stage; this, in turn, led him to lament that such a wall exists. With its significantly darker theme, The Wall featured a notably harsher and more theatrical sound than their previous releases.\n\nThe Wall is a rock opera that centres on the character \"Pink\". Largely based on Waters' personal life, Pink struggles in life from an early age, having lost his father in war (\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)\"), abused by teachers (\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\"), nurtured by an overprotective mother (\"Mother\"), and deserted by his wife later on (\"Don't Leave Me Now\") — all of which factored into Pink's mental isolation from society, figuratively referred to as \"The Wall\". Once Pink is behind his Wall, he slowly becomes insane due to his isolation from his fellow man. This culminates at a concert held by Pink, where he sets his \"men\" on fans he deems unworthy. He then puts himself on trial (\"The Trial\") and finds himself guilty for causing his problems. The album then ends with a monologue by Waters; the fate of Pink is unknown.\n\nThe Wall quickly became a bestseller and was eventually certified 26x platinum. It is the Floyd's second-best-selling album after Dark Side of the Moon. However, The Wall contributed heavily to the split in the group that came soon after its release. Roger Waters (lead vocalist) fired keyboardist Rick Wright part way through the recording sessions and assumed most of the creative control over the album. Pink Floyd produced just one more album, The Final Cut, which was practically a Waters solo project, before Rogers finally left the band in the early 80's.\n\nThe Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second best-selling album in the band's catalogue (behind The Dark Side of the Moon), the best selling double-album of all time, and one of the best-selling albums of all time overall. Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were used on the group's next album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest albums of all time. From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new Wall live tour that became the highest-grossing tour by a solo musician. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Wall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
