      "biography": "XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.\n\nPartridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and avant-garde. The single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including \"Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)\" (1980) and \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982). After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding and guitarist Dave Gregory. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking (1986), Oranges & Lemons (1989) and Nonsuch (1992). In the US, \"Mayor of Simpleton\" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while \"Dear God\" (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.\n\nDue to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of Apple Venus Volume 1 (1999), after which the XTC name briefly served as a banner for what were effectively solo efforts by Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC \"in the past tense\". Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC&I in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active.",

Over the years, the band experimented with increasingly complex arrangements that shaded their songs in dramatic light.

The album was lushly produced with multiple overdubs on almost every track, yielding the psychedelic feel.\n\nThe album produced a minor hit, \"The Mayor of Simpleton\", the only XTC song ever to hit the US Hot 100 charts. The album was a commercial success, reaching the charts in both the US and Britain. \"The Mayor of Simpleton\" video, which resembled the opening credits of a The Avengers-type TV show, also saw significant airplay on MTV, especially on the alternative music show \"120 Minutes.\"\n\nThe album produced three hit singles: \"The Mayor of Simpleton\" - reaching No. 1 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, No. 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 46 on the UK singles chart. \"King for a Day\" which reached No. 10 on the US alternative / modern rock charts and \"The Loving\" which was released in August 1989 in the UK. The album reached No. 1 on the US college / alternative album chart, No. 44 on the US Billboard Top 100 chart and No. 28 on the UK album chart.\n\nTo promote the album and appease the stage-shy Andy Partridge the band went on a two-week acoustic radio-station tour of the US, on which they performed a few songs from the album and a few medleys of earlier hits. The tour commenced on 15 May 1989 in Boston and ended on 31 May 1989 at Eastern Sound Studios in Toronto before a live studio audience of two hundred people.\n\nAlso of note: \"King For a Day,\" which the band performed on Late Night With David Letterman on 30 June 1989; \"Pink Thing,\" which was a classic XTC double-entendre; \"Chalkhills and Children,\" which lead singer Andy Partridge considers one of his favorite compositions.\n\nThe album cover is directly inspired by a 1965 WOR-FM 98.7 radio advert poster by Milton Glaser. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/XTC/Oranges+&+Lemons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
