      "biography": "Pet Shop Boys are an English electronic dance music duo, consisting of Neil Tennant, who provides main vocals, keyboards and occasional guitar, and Chris Lowe on keyboards.\nOne of the world's best-selling music artists, Pet Shop Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide and are listed as the most successful duo in UK music history by The Guinness Book of Records. Three-time Brit Award winners and six-time Grammy nominees, since 1986 they have achieved 42 Top 30 singles and 22 Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart, including four number ones: \"West End Girls\", \"It's a Sin\", \"Always on My Mind\" and \"Heart\".\nAt the 2009 BRIT Awards, Pet Shop Boys received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The duo's latest studio album, Yes (continuing their tradition of single word titles) was released on 23 March 2009. The band's eleventh studio album, titled Elysium is due for release in September 2012, the first single of which, titled \"Winner\", was released on 2 July 2012.\nNeil Tennant and Chris Lowe met in an electronics shop on Kings Road in Chelsea, London in August 1981. Recognising a mutual interest in dance music, they began to work on material together, first in Tennant's flat in Chelsea and from 1982, in a small studio in Camden Town. It was during those early years that several future hit songs were created, including \"It's a Sin\", \"West End Girls\", \"Rent\" and \"Jealousy\".\nStarting out, the two called themselves West End because of their love of London's West End, but later they came up with the name Pet Shop Boys, derived from friends of theirs who worked in a pet shop in Ealing. Their big break came in August 1983, when Tennant was assigned by Smash Hits to interview The Police in New York. The duo were obsessed with a stream of Hi-NRG records made by New York producer Bobby Orlando, simply known as Bobby 'O'. According to Tennant: \"I thought: well, if I've got to go and see The Police play, then I'm also going to have lunch with Bobby 'O'.\" They shared a cheeseburger and carrot cake, at a restaurant called the Apple Jack, on 19 August (two years to the day since Tennant and Lowe had met) and, after hearing a demo tape that Tennant had brought along with him, Orlando suggested making a record with the Pet Shop Boys.\nIn April 1984, the Orlando-produced \"West End Girls\" was released, becoming a club hit in Los Angeles and San Francisco. On 2 November, it was voted \"Screamer of the Week\" by listeners of Long Island, New York radio station WLIR. It was a minor dance hit in Belgium, and France, but was only available in the United Kingdom as a 12\" import.",

According to the duo, the album's title was chosen so that people had to go into a record shop and say \"Can I have the Pet Shop Boys album, 'Please'?\" The debut album has sold to date in the region of 3 million copies worldwide.\n\nHits from Please include \"West End Girls,\", \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money),\" \"Suburbia\" and \"Love comes quickly\". \"West End Girls\" was a hit in both the UK and the United States.\n\nAs with many early PSB albums, the lyrics were considered androgynous, the stories they contain being equally applicable to gay and heterosexual relationships. Tennant, in particular, enjoyed this ambiguity and refused to comment on his own sexuality until he came out before 1993's Very hit the charts.\n\nThe tiny cover photograph enclosed by a sea of white has been seen by some design observers as a reaction to the traditional album cover. With the new CD cases of the time being necessarily smaller than designs seen on 12\" albums, the passport-sized photograph is far removed from standard cover artwork. The actual size of the image is the same size as a 35mm photographic negative.\n\n\"Two Divided by Zero\" samples a Texas Instruments Speak & Spell toy.\n\nPlease was rereleased in 2001 (as were most of the group's albums up to that point) as Please/Further Listening 1984-1986. The rereleased version was not only digitally remastered but came with a second disc of B-sides and previously unreleased material from around the time of the album's original release.\n\n\"Suburbia\" was dramatically remixed for the single release.\n\n\"Violence\" was later rerecorded by the Pet Shop Boys for a charity concert at the Hacienda nightclub in the early 1990s. This version, known as the 'Hacienda Version', was released as one of the b-sides to \"I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing\" and was then made available on the b-sides album Alternative and the 2001 2-disc rerelease of the Very album.\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys later sampled the Please version of \"Love comes quickly\" for their song \"Somebody else's business\", which appeared on the Disco 3 album.\n\n\"Tonight is forever\" was later covered by Liza Minnelli on the Pet Shop Boys-produced album Results. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pet+Shop+Boys/Please\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
